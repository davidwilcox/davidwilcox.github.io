<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Good afternoon, brothers and sisters.  And welcome to Rexburg in January!!  I am grateful for
this chance to worship with you as we begin another new semester at Brigham Young University-Idaho.  I pray for and invite the Holy Ghost to be with me and with you as together we <i>&#8220;. . . seek
learning, even by study and also by faith&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:118).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Today I want to discuss with you basic components of <i>&#8220;the great plan of happiness&#8221; </i>(Alma
42:8,16), the meaning and role of happiness in the plan, and the relationship between happiness
and obedience.  We also will discuss the implications of what we learn about happiness and
obedience for you as young women and young men who live on the earth at this time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Plan</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In this the dispensation of the fulness of times, many plain and precious truths have again been
restored to the earth concerning the divine plan of happiness and our eternal destiny as sons and
daughters of the Eternal Father.  The great plan of happiness is designed to bring about man&#8217;s
immortality and eternal life.  The plan includes the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement, along
with all God-given laws, ordinances, and doctrines.  The plan makes it possible for all people to
be exalted and live forever with God (2 Nephi 2, 9).  The scriptures also refer to this plan as <i>&#8220;the
plan of salvation&#8221; </i>(Alma 24:14; Alma 42:5; Moses 6:62), <i>&#8220;the plan of redemption&#8221; </i>(Alma
12:25; Alma 22:13; Alma 34:16), and <i>&#8220;the plan of mercy&#8221; </i>(Alma 42:15, 31).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In particular, the restoration scriptures&#8212;the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and
the Pearl of Great Price&#8212;contain a wealth of knowledge about the plan of happiness.  Please turn
with me in the Pearl of Great Price to Abraham 3:24-26.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those
who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of
these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the
Lord their God shall command them;</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not
their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep
their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added
upon their heads for ever and ever.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In these three verses we are introduced to the fundamental and essential elements of the great
plan of happiness.  The primary purpose for the creation of the earth was to prepare a place
whereon the Father&#8217;s children would be proved to see if they (meaning you and me) would do all
things whatsoever<i> &#8220;the Lord their God shall command them.&#8221;</i>  We further learn that those who
kept their first estate, meaning those spirits who were faithful in the premortal existence, would
have the opportunity to be added upon by obtaining a physical body and through their
experiences in mortality&#8212;and that those who kept their second estate, meaning those who were
faithful in mortality, could have glory added upon their heads throughout eternity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I find verse 25 especially interesting.  The very purpose of the creation and of our mortal
existence is to see if you and I will do and become whatever the Lord instructs and commands us
to do and to become.  We have been endowed with agency&#8212;the capacity of independent
action&#8212;for the precise purpose of obeying God and seeking righteousness.  We have not been
blessed with agency to do whatever we want whenever we will.  Rather, according to the plan,
we are to exercise our agency in doing and becoming whatever God commands.  For that purpose
the earth was created.  For that purpose you and I are here in the second estate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Role of Happiness in the Plan</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Please now consider the relationship between the great plan of happiness and the law of
obedience.  The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if
we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness,
faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God. But we cannot
keep all the commandments without first knowing them, and we cannot expect to
know all, or more than we now know unless we comply with or keep those we
have already received</i>  (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</span>, Section Five,
1842&#8211;43, p. 255).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Note the connection between happiness, which is the very object of the plan of happiness and of
our mortal existence, and obedience to the commandments of God.  Obedience is central to
becoming and being and remaining happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The Prophet further explained:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>But in obedience there is joy and peace unspotted, unalloyed; and as God has
designed our happiness&#8212;and the happiness of all His creatures, he never
has&#8212;He never will institute an ordinance or give a commandment to His people
that is not calculated in its nature to promote that happiness which He has
designed, and which will not end in the greatest amount of good and glory to
those who become the recipients of his law and ordinances </i> (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings of the
Prophet Joseph Smith</span>, Section Five, 1842&#8211;43, p. 256).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">All that our Father gives to us and all that He requires of us is designed to promote the very
happiness that is the object of the plan and of our existence.  Obedience is neither a chore nor a
burden; rather, it is the source of true happiness in both mortality and eternity.  We do not yield
or give up our happiness when we obey.  Obeying causes happiness.  Obedience frequently is
referred to as the first law of heaven; it is also the key which opens the door to the happiness
intended for God&#8217;s children in the great plan of happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Please now turn with me in the Book of Mormon to Mosiah 2:41:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the <span style="font-weight: bold">blessed</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">happy</span>
state of those that keep the commandments of God.  For behold, they are blessed
in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end
they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of
never-ending happiness.  O remember, remember that these things are true; for
the Lord God hath spoken it  </i>(emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I want to draw our attention to three key elements in this scripture.  First, the words <span style="font-weight: bold">blessed</span> and
<span style="font-weight: bold">happy</span> in this verse essentially are synonymous.  In other words, to be blessed is to be happy and
to be happy is to be blessed.  We often correctly refer to happiness as a mood or an attitude or an
emotion.  But this verse helps us understand that happiness also is a state of being blessed as a
result of keeping the commandments of God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Brothers and sisters, the essence of what I hope to communicate this afternoon is built upon this
one basic principle: to be blessed is to be happy and to be happy is to be blessed.  Consider this
relationship among <span style="font-weight: bold">obedience</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">blessings</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">happiness</span> as we read together Doctrine and
Covenants 130:20-21:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this
world, upon which all <span style="font-weight: bold">blessings</span> [and happiness] are predicated&#8212;</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And when we obtain any <span style="font-weight: bold">blessing</span> [and happiness] from God, it is by <span style="font-weight: bold">obedience</span> to
that law upon which it is predicated  </i>(emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">This relationship also is highlighted in Doctrine and Covenants 132:5:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>For all who will have a <span style="font-weight: bold">blessing</span> [and happiness] at my hands shall <span style="font-weight: bold">abide the law</span>
which was appointed for that <span style="font-weight: bold">blessing</span> [and happiness], and the conditions
thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation of the world. </i> (emphasis
added)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Second, notice in Mosiah 2:41 how the verse emphasizes that those who keep the
commandments <i>&#8220;. . . are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual . . . .&#8221;  </i>Let me suggest
that this phrase points to the second estate or &#8220;here and now&#8221; blessings that flow from obedience. 
And third, the anticipated or third estate and eternal blessings associated with keeping the
commandments are featured in the line <i>&#8220;. . . if they hold out faithful to the end they are received
into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness . . . .&#8221;</i> 
Simply stated, brothers and sisters, keeping the commandments invites both proximate and future
blessings and happiness into our lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In our study of the scriptures, we quickly recognize that the Book of Mormon is the handbook for
happiness.  The word happiness is used 28 times in the standard works, and 26 of the 28 verses
that contain the word <span style="font-weight: bold">happiness</span> are found in the Book of Mormon.  One reference to happiness
is found in the Doctrine and Covenants, and one reference is found in the Pearl of Great Price. 
Thus, all scriptural references to happiness are found in the restoration scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Please consider and reflect upon these remarkable teachings from the Book of Mormon:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And if there be no righteousness there be no <span style="font-weight: bold">happiness</span></i>  (2 Nephi 2:13, emphasis
added).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of <span style="font-weight: bold">happiness</span></i> (2&#160;Nephi&#160;5:27,
emphasis added).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Now was not this exceeding joy?  Behold, this is joy which none receiveth save it
be the truly penitent and humble seeker of <span style="font-weight: bold">happiness</span></i>  (Alma 27:18, emphasis
added).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was <span style="font-weight: bold">happiness</span></i>  (Alma&#160;41:10, emphasis
added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Clearly, in the restoration scriptures in general and the Book of Mormon in particular, we find
many plain and precious truths that have been restored about the great plan of happiness and the
spiritual state of happiness to which we all should aspire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-weight: bold">Happiness and Obedience and the Youth of the Church</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In October of 1997 Elder Neal A. Maxwell visited our campus to speak in a devotional.  Sister
Bednar and I provided transportation to and from the Idaho Falls airport for Elder and Sister
Maxwell, and we hosted them for lunch in our home.  The time we spent with this mighty
Apostle and his lovely wife before and after the devotional was invaluable, and the lessons we
learned were priceless.  As we talked together about a variety of gospel topics in general and the
youth of the Church in particular, Elder Maxwell made a statement that greatly impressed me. 
He said, &#8220;<i>The youth of this generation have a greater capacity for obedience than any previous
generation.</i>&#8221;  He then indicated that his statement was based upon a principle taught by
Elder&#160;George Q. Cannon in the early days of the Restoration.  Please listen carefully to the
following statement by Elder Cannon:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>God has reserved spirits for this dispensation who have the courage and
determination to face the world, and all the powers of the evil one, visible and
invisible, to proclaim the Gospel, and maintain the truth, and establish and build
up the Zion of our God, fearless of all consequences.  He has sent these spirits in
this generation to lay the foundation of Zion never more to be overthrown, and to
raise up a seed that will be righteous, and that will honor God, and honor him
supremely, and <span style="font-weight: bold">be obedient to him under all circumstances</span> </i> (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Journal of
Discourses</span>, 11:230 [May 6, 1866], emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We frequently are reminded by our church leaders that the young men and women of this
generation have been reserved for this day and are some of the most valiant of Heavenly Father&#8217;s
children.  But these additional insights by Elders Cannon and Maxwell help us further to
understand that today&#8217;s young people have a greater capacity for obedience and are to be valiant
and &#8220;<i>. . . obedient to him under all circumstances.</i>&#8221;  And an additional and important implication
of these teachings is clear:  those blessed with the greatest capacity to obey also have the greatest
opportunity for true and lasting happiness.<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-weight: bold">Obedience Operates at Different Levels</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Brothers and sisters, obedience operates at a number of different levels.  Elder Bruce R.
McConkie has taught:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Obedience is the first law of heaven, the cornerstone upon which all
righteousness and progression rest.  It consists in <span style="font-weight: bold">compliance</span> with divine law, in
<span style="font-weight: bold">conformity</span> to the mind and will of Deity, in complete <span style="font-weight: bold">subjection</span> to God and his
commands.  To obey gospel law is to yield obedience to the Lord, to execute the
commands of and be ruled by him whose we are</i>  (Bruce R. McConkie, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Mormon
Doctrine</span>, p. 539, emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Note how Elder McConkie includes the elements of <span style="font-weight: bold">compliance</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">conformity</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold">subjection</span> or
<span style="font-weight: bold">submission</span> in his description of obedience.  Let me suggest that each of these three elements can
be considered as a progressive level of obedience.  And each level of obedience leads to an ever-increasing state of happiness.  Thus, happiness and obedience are not simply passive steady
states; rather, they must grow and develop and deepen and increase and expand.  Our experience
with and understanding of happiness and obedience should change as we develop spiritually and
as we gain additional light and knowledge&#8212;line upon line and precept upon precept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Let me now present a series of comparisons that illustrate how obedience operates at different
levels.  It is one thing to obey in order <span style="font-weight: bold">to quality for and receive blessings for ourselves</span>; it is
quite another thing to obey as a preparation <span style="font-weight: bold">to give and to serve others more effectively</span>.  And
obedience motivated by a desire to give and to serve more effectively yields a happiness far
greater than that produced by obedience intended to benefit self.   It is one thing to merely and
perhaps mechanically <span style="font-weight: bold">comply</span> with God&#8217;s commandments; it is quite another thing to obey and
thereby fully <span style="font-weight: bold">submit</span> and subject oneself to the will and timetable of the Lord&#8212;and to experience
happiness in Him.  It is a good thing to obey out of a sense of <span style="font-weight: bold">duty</span>;  but it is an even greater
thing, a more spiritually demanding thing, to obey through <span style="font-weight: bold">love</span>.  It is one thing to reluctantly or
grudgingly <span style="font-weight: bold">conform</span> to commandments; it is a different thing to joyfully <i>&#8220;.&#160;. .&#160;obey and observe
to perform every word of command with <span style="font-weight: bold">exactness</span>  . . .&#8221; </i>(Alma 57:21, emphasis added) and
cheerfully  <i>&#8220;. . . <span style="font-weight: bold">observe strictly</span> to keep the commandments of God . . .&#8221;</i> (Helaman 13:1,
emphasis added).  It is one thing to perform the <span style="font-weight: bold">outward actions </span>of obedience; it is quite a
different thing to<span style="font-weight: bold"> become inwardly</span> what the commandments are intended to help us become.   It
is one thing to obey the <span style="font-weight: bold">institutional</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">public</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold">shared</span> commandments associated with the
Lord&#8217;s kingdom on earth&#8212;commandments such as the law of chastity, the law of tithing, and the
Word of Wisdom; it is an even greater thing to receive and respond to the <span style="font-weight: bold">individual</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">private</span>,
and <span style="font-weight: bold">personally revealed</span> commandments that result from continual and faithful obedience.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-weight: bold">Commandments Not a Few</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Please turn with me to Doctrine and Covenants, section 59, verses 3 and 4:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Yea, blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who have obeyed my
gospel; for they shall receive for their reward <span style="font-weight: bold">the good things of the earth</span>, and it
shall bring forth in its strength.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And they shall also be crowned with <span style="font-weight: bold">blessings from above</span>, yea, and with
<span style="font-weight: bold">commandments not a few</span>, and with <span style="font-weight: bold">revelations in their time</span>&#8212;they that are
faithful and diligent before me</i>  (emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We learn in these verses that those who have obeyed the gospel shall receive the good things of
the earth, blessings from above, commandments not a few, and revelations in their time.  In
particular I now want to draw our attention to the phrase &#8220;<i>and with commandments not a few</i>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Brothers and sisters, for the past few minutes I have attempted to differentiate between obedience
that is predominately complying and conforming in nature and a higher level of obedience that
includes spiritual submission and enables us to receive &#8220;<i>commandments not a few</i>.&#8221;  Obedience
that is primarily complying and conforming is good and is truly obedience.  But the higher level
of obedience I am trying to describe&#8212;an obedience that stretches beyond the letter of the law to
the spirit of the law&#8212;is both<span style="font-weight: bold"> heartfelt and willing</span>.  And it brings an individualized gospel
insight and a perspective and a power and a state of happiness that are precious beyond measure. 
As we read in section 64 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 34:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Behold, the Lord requireth the <span style="font-weight: bold">heart</span> and a willing mind; and the <span style="font-weight: bold">willing</span> and
<span style="font-weight: bold">obedient</span> shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days </i> (emphasis
added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Progressing from the level of complying obedience to the level and happiness associated with
<span style="font-weight: bold">heartfelt and willing</span> obedience does not occur quickly or all at once.  Nor is it merely a matter
of greater personal discipline; it is a change of disposition, a change of heart.  And this gradual
change of heart is one that the Lord accomplishes within us, through the power of his Spirit, in a
line-upon-line fashion.  For example, in Philippians 2:12, Paul encourages the Saints to <i>&#8220;. . .
work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&#8221;</i>  But how are we to do that?  Note the
answer that follows in verse 13:  <i>&#8220;For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
his good pleasure.&#8221;</i>  That is, we give ourselves to the Lord and choose to be changed.  He is
working on us and in us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Brothers and sisters, it is vitally important for all of us to remember that progressing to higher
and more spiritually demanding levels of obedience is not simply a matter of more personal
determination, more grit, and more willpower; rather, it is accomplished through the enabling
power of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Thus, true and lasting happiness is a function
of progressing to and through &#8220;letter of the law&#8221; obedience to public and institutional
commandments and toward the spirit of devoted discipleship and a private, personal, and
individual change of heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I find it fascinating that one of the greatest blessings related to keeping God&#8217;s commandments is
additional commandments.  Now, individuals who find commandments restrictive and
constraining clearly will not regard more commandments as a blessing and as a source of
happiness.  But the Apostle John taught that for one who has come unto Christ and been born
again, God&#8217;s <i>&#8220;commandments are not grievous&#8221;</i> (1 John 5:3).  Thus, individuals who have eyes
to see and ears to hear will readily recognize the consummate spiritual benefit and happiness that
come from additional direction from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">What are these &#8220;<i>commandments not a few</i>&#8221; and how do we receive them?  The individual and
personal &#8220;<i>commandments not a few</i>&#8221; we receive frequently tend to focus upon the good things we
can and should do to develop and deepen our discipleship&#8212;as opposed to focusing primarily
upon the bad things we must avoid or overcome.  Such instructions typically are proactive and
anticipatory in nature.  For example, many of us remember the teachings of President Spencer W.
Kimball concerning fast offerings.  He stated:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>I think that when we are affluent, as many of us are, that we ought to be very, very
generous . . . .  I think we should be very generous and give, instead of the amount
we saved by our two meals of fasting, perhaps much, much more&#8212;ten times more
where we are in a position to do it </i> (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Conference Report</span>, April 1974, p.&#160;184).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Thus, an individual or a family may be prompted to freely and willingly and cheerfully contribute
to the fast offering fund at a level far beyond the routine and basic &#8220;letter of the law&#8221; standards
with which most of us are familiar.  The &#8220;<i>commandments not a few</i>&#8221; in this example are gladly
obeyed in order to bless and strengthen others with serious challenges and insufficient resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">A few additional examples may be helpful.  As I proceed, however, please keep in mind that I am
not attempting to provide a comprehensive list of what &#8220;<i>commandments not a few</i>&#8221; are or should
be.  Such commandments are individual and quite personal; nonetheless, a further  illustration or
two can help us to better comprehend this concept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">To an obedient young man or woman striving to live a morally pure life may come individualized
&#8220;<i>commandments not a few</i>&#8221; about properly controlling personal thoughts.  Such tutoring by the
Holy Ghost can help a young woman or man to <i>&#8220;. . . let virtue garnish [his or her] thoughts
unceasingly . . .&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 121:45) and to <i>&#8220;. . . let all thy thoughts be directed
unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever&#8221;</i>
(Alma:37:36).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">&#160;&#8220;<i>Commandments not a few</i>&#8221; may come to concerned and committed parents in Zion about
discerning seemingly ordinary and simple gospel teaching opportunities within the walls of their
own home.  To be sure, such parents faithfully attend Church meetings with their children and
consistently hold home evening and family council as instructed by our leaders.   But these
parents will also be urged by the Holy Ghost to teach and testify daily at the dinner table or in the
car or while performing routine household chores or playing together as a family.  Children
reared in such a gospel and Christ-centered home may also one day proclaim,<i> &#8220;. . .&#160;We do not
doubt our mothers [and fathers] knew it&#8221; </i>(Alma 56:48).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">To an honest Latter-day Saint may come &#8220;<i>commandments not a few</i>&#8221; concerning personal
honesty and integrity and trustworthiness.  Obviously, such an individual would never deceive an
employer or cheat on a test or research paper at school or betray a confidence at home or at
Church or at work.  But individualized instruction by the Holy Ghost may assist this person to
give the full measure in his or her work and to be more honest with himself or herself&#8212;and to
see things <i>&#8220;. . . as they [really] are . . .&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 93:24).  The Holy Ghost also
can help such an individual communicate with others in an increasingly honest and appropriate
way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><span style="text-decoration: underline">God&#8217;s Work and Our Work</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Among the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one of the most well-known and frequently quoted passages of scripture is found in Moses 1:39.  This verse clearly
and concisely describes the Eternal Father&#8217;s work and glory, and I am confident most of us can
recite it perfectly from memory:  <i>&#8220;For behold, this is <span style="font-weight: bold">my work</span> and my glory&#8212;to bring to pass
the immortality and eternal life of man&#8221;</i> (emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">A companion scripture found in the Doctrine and Covenants describes with equal clarity and
conciseness our primary work as the sons and daughters of the Eternal Father.  Interestingly, this
verse does not seem to be as well-known and is not quoted with great frequency.  Please turn
with me to Doctrine and Covenants, section 11, verse 20:  <i>&#8220;Behold, this is <span style="font-weight: bold">your work</span>, to keep my
commandments, yea, with all your might, mind and strength&#8221;</i> (emphasis added)<i>.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Thus, the plan and the work of the Father are to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of
His children.  Our work is to keep His commandments with all of our might, mind, and
strength&#8212;that thereby we might receive the happiness which is the object and design of our
existence.  May each of us learn and understand that being blessed and being happy are the result
of obedience, and may we have a greater desire and determination to obey God&#8217;s commandments
with all of our hearts and with willing minds.  May we be blessed to qualify for and to receive
and to recognize &#8220;<i>commandments not a few.</i>&#8221;  May each of us also discern that obedience is the
key that opens the door to the supernal blessings of the great plan of happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Brothers and sisters, I testify that God the Eternal Father lives.  Jesus Christ is His Only Begotten
Son.  And I witness that the Father&#8217;s eternal plan enables us to be happy and blessed as we obey. 
In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center">
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In the backyard of the home where we live, we have a raspberry patch which every July bears the
most delectable raspberries you have ever tasted.  One summer morning when I was out weeding
our garden, I noticed an attractive vine had wound its way up the stalk of one of the raspberry
bushes.  Since vines grow on everything where we used to live, I didn&#8217;t think anything of it.  I
noted with interest that when the vine reached the top of the stalk, its curling tendrils latched onto
the stalk of an adjacent raspberry bush forcibly leading, bending, and pulling the one in it&#8217;s grasp
in whatever direction the vine happened to grow.  The unsuspecting stalk was held captive by the
growth of this fascinating vine.<span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">You can imagine my amazement when I read one day in the newspaper that this beautiful vine
was considered an aggressive and dangerous menace, and anyone who had this &#8220;noxious weed&#8221;
growing on their property was to report it to the county weed superintendent.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">As I reflected on the image of this attractive yet harmful and destructive vine winding around the
stalk of the raspberry bush, two scriptures from the Book of Mormon came to my mind.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>. . . and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth 
them with his strong cords forever </i>(2 Nephi 26:22). </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>. . . and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth 
them away carefully down to hell</i>  (2 Nephi 28:21).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">A question also popped into my mind:  What seemingly weak yet potentially strong cords could
the adversary employ to lead and bend and pull us carefully toward him?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Let me share what I believe these deceptive cords could be.  I think they are attitudes and
behavior we call &#8220;safe rebellion.&#8221;   For many years I have heard the phrase &#8220;safe rebellion&#8221; used
among youth and adults in the Church.  This term suggests that forms of subtle and
inconspicuous defiance and disobedience, coupled with rationalization and justification for
inappropriate behavior, are considered permissible, acceptable, and even harmless.  It is a way to
&#8220;sort of trespass or sin just a little&#8221; but not put ourselves in any lasting spiritual danger&#8212;or so we
think.  Consider these subtle statements we hear almost every day and the behavior that
accompanies them:  &#8220;I have my agency, and I can do as I please.&#8221;  &#8220;It&#8217;s no big deal, and I&#8217;m not
hurting anyone else.&#8221;  &#8220;I know what the prophet says, but my situation is different.&#8221;  One of these
statements defies, one rationalizes, and one justifies.  Are these typical rebellious attitudes and
behaviors safe and harmless; or, like the noxious vine, are they deceptive tools of the adversary
that can lead and bend and eventually pull us toward our own spiritual downfall and destruction?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Scripture defines the rebellious as those who turn away from the Lord and despise his judgments,
those who hear but won&#8217;t hearken to His words, and those who have eyes to see but won&#8217;t (see
Ezekiel 20:13; Isaiah 30:9; Alma 10:6; Ezekiel 12:2).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">A scripture in 3 Nephi describes the rebellious perfectly:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them,
for it had been taught unto them; therefore they did wilfully rebel against God </i> (3
Nephi 6:18).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The term rebellious is also used scripturally in conjunction with the words disobedient, stubborn,
stiff-necked, and hard hearted (see Nehemiah 9:26; Psalms 78:8; Deuteronomy 31:27;
2&#160;Chronicles 36:13).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Do any of us fit this definition of rebellious?   I know at times I do.  At various moments and in
different ways, the natural man (see Mosiah 16:5) in all of us surfaces, and being a bit rebellious
seems deceptively alluring, attractive, and harmless&#8212;just as the vine on the raspberry stalk.  We
enjoy the false feeling of independence which accompanies our rebellious streak.  We don&#8217;t want
anyone else controlling our lives or telling us what to do&#8212;sometimes not even the Lord or His
servants.  We wrongly express our sovereignty by picking and choosing which standards we wish
to disobey and to what degree we will disobey them&#8212;a little or a lot.  We&#8217;re defiant, and we
know it, and we&#8217;re proud of it.  We mock and ridicule others whom we perceive as too straight,
too strict, or too compliant in the way they live the gospel.  Then we give congratulatory pats on
the back to ourselves and each other for bending or breaking the rules just a little and getting
away with it.  We salve our consciences with self-satisfying rationalizations, and we justify our
unseemly behavior as benign.  But is any form of disobedience or measure of rebellion safe and
harmless?  I&#8217;ve come to think not.  Let me explain why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The Bible Dictionary teaches that in the premortal life Lucifer and his followers refused to accept
the appointment of Jesus Christ as the Savior of our Heavenly Father&#8217;s eternal plan.  Because of
their rebellion, they were cast from His presence.  Thus, the devil became the enemy of
righteousness and of those who seek to do the will of God (see Bible Dictionary, Devil). Refusal
to submit and a rebellious attitude caused the devil&#8217;s downfall, and he knows it can cause ours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Ponder this statement from President Harold B. Lee:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>There are carefully charted on the maps of the opposition the weak spots in every
one of us.  They are known to the forces of evil, and just the moment we lower the
defense of any one of those ports, that becomes the D Day of our invasion, and
our souls are in danger</i>  (<i>Powers of the Gospel</i>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Improvement Era</span>, November
1949, p. 737).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Defiance, rationalization, and justification expose our human frailties and susceptibilities and
entice us to forfeit our willingness to freely submit our will to the will of the Father.  By
incremental steps, the lie of safe rebellion can eventually wind its way around our unsuspecting
hearts and minds&#8212;carefully taking advantage of our weaknesses until we are bound by the strong
cords of the adversary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">My dear young friends, it&#8217;s time to see safe rebellion for what it really is&#8212;an attractive, yet
noxious and destructive weed.  It&#8217;s time to pull it out.  And it may even be necessary to call the
weed superintendent to learn how to permanently eradicate it! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">As we seek to cultivate a more humble and submissive attitude along with obedient behavior,
may we know there is understanding from a caring Father in Heaven, succor from our loving
Savior, and assistance from the holy scriptures and the wise teachings of living prophets and
apostles.  May we have the courage to seek their fortifying help is my prayer, in the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Let me begin my remarks by telling you that your lives are of great concern to President
Hinckley and his associates - myself included.  We pray for you students regularly; we
realize that you are the future leaders of this church, the hope of your future communities
and the hope of the nation, really, the hope of the world.  In fact, you are given the
charge, responsibility and privilege directly from our Father in heaven to prepare a
people (and I might add not just a few) to meet the Lord in His great Second Coming. We
love you very much and appreciate your being at this university. We want you to succeed
in your lives: President Hinckley wants you to succeed, the members of the Council of
the Twelve Apostles want you to succeed, President Bednar, whom I know well and
respect, wants you to succeed. Your faith, devotion, and belief in the Lord Jesus Christ
have brought you here. We want this to be a place where your faith will continue to
strengthen and grow.  My assistant&#8217;s husband&#8217;s great-great grandfather was Thomas E.
Ricks.  They have strong family ties to this area and are so grateful for the opportunities

<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My wife&#8217;s father, Leslie James Anderson, grew up in the small town of Manti, Utah.  In
1919 when Les was only 14 years old, Sanpete County built a road up Manti Canyon
using what was then a common method of <span style="font-weight: bold">detonating black blasting powder</span> to remove
difficult rocks and sharp canyon walls that could not be subdued any other way.  Late
that summer, Les, his cousin and best friend, Lyle Anderson, and two other friends
decided to go up that new canyon road to fish and camp overnight at the Corduroy
Reservoir.  These young, adventuresome boys loaded their camping gear in a one-horse
buggy and started up the canyon as a foursome, without any adult supervisors.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As you can imagine, these boys were about as happy as Tom Sawyer to be on an
overnighter on their own.  I can imagine them now, cheerfully and playfully making their
way up the canyon road, anticipating all the fun and adventure that awaited them.  On the
way, the boys found along the side of the road a supply of the explosive <span style="font-weight: bold">black powder</span>
that had been left behind by the road builders.   Les and his cousin, Lyle, were intrigued
and excited by this discovery and instantly imagined the fun they could have with the
powder that night around the campfire.  They eagerly filled their pockets and a hat with
as much black powder as they could hold.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Later on that afternoon when they arrived at the camp, they turned their horse loose to
return home to Manti, knowing the horse would be needed at home and that on their
return they could pull the little buggy down hill by themselves. After pitching their camp
and building a campfire, the boys thought they&#8217;d have some fun.  At about 9 o&#8217;clock that
evening, Les and Lyle started throwing some of the black powder into the fire and
watching it explode with a bang.  But with one of these explosions, a spark landed in the
hat filled with powder and ignited it.  It exploded and then ignited the powder in their
pockets.  In an instant, the air was filled with piercing screams, and the boys&#8217; clothing
was a mass of flames.  The two boys in the tent rushed out to help Les and Lyle, but they
couldn&#8217;t put out the flames until the clothing was almost entirely burned off, and Les and
Lyle were covered with deep burns.  The other boys wrapped quilts around Les and Lyle
and placed them as gently as possible in the buggy and then started pulling the buggy
down the canyon in the dark.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">All the way down the canyon, the two badly burnt boys kept calling for water.  In fact, at
one point Les could hear water running in the creek close to the road.  The buggy was
going quite slowly at that moment, so Les rolled himself out of the buggy and into the
water.  Les said later that he thought this saved his life as the cool water eased the pain of
his burns.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Les&#8217; cousin and best friend, Lyle, was not as fortunate; he stayed in the buggy near death
as they returned down the rocky road to Manti, finally arriving home at about 11:00 p.m. 
Despite a constant vigil of medical attention throughout the night, the next morning Lyle
died.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It took Les two years to recuperate, including one full year of missed school.  When I met
him at age fifty-three, although his face was scar-free, he still had deep scars from his
feet all the way up his back and along his arms.  Thanks to the fasting and prayers of the
good people of Manti and his own sheer will, he healed well enough to embrace the
responsibilities of adulthood and live a full life.  He served his country in World War II
as a Bombardment Squadron Commander in Italy, rising to the rank of colonel in the
Army Air Corps.  He returned safely after the war, was eventually elected Mayor of
Manti, and served faithfully in the Manti South Ward bishopric.  The fruit of his
faithfulness is manifest today in a large and faithful posterity.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In important ways, my dear young friends, you are like my father-in-law, Les, as he
ventured up the canyon on that fateful day nearly 90 years ago: you have been given
independence and responsibility at a relatively tender age.  Even as Les and his friends
ventured off on their first camping trip alone, most of you have ventured out of the nest
of your parents&#8217; home and are discovering how to &#8220;be your own boss&#8221; and live life on
your own.  In short, you have more opportunity than ever before in your life to <span style="font-weight: bold">exercise
your Agency</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Each of you, as you venture into this world of opportunity, will sooner or later happen
upon your own &#8220;black powder&#8221;.  At first you may find it curious; it may even make you
smile at first and seem to hold great promise of fun.  But I hope we will all profit from
Les&#8217; boyhood mistake.  Don&#8217;t chance to play with black powder.  Don&#8217;t tempt fate. 
What seems harmless, manageable and acceptable can quickly burst out of control
leaving only destruction and heartache in its wake.  Be it R-rated movies, late nights
alone with your girlfriend or boyfriend, or cheating on an exam.  Your specific instance
of black powder may be one of these, or it may be one of any other host of Satan&#8217;s traps. 
But whatever it is, you will be warned by the Holy Spirit.  You will know.  And when
that warning comes, please, please obey.    You cannot venture, even once, to risk your
spiritual well being.  The stakes are high; your eternal soul is in the balance.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Today my thesis is that the restoration of the Gospel can and should help you.  </span>The
priesthood and the fullness of the gospel were restored in these last days to help you and
me refrain from evil acts that will put us in danger and instead to do righteous acts that
we may have clean hands and pure hearts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Yes, today I&#8217;d like to talk with you about
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">your</span> Agency and how the
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">Priesthood</span> can have
a positive influence on the choices you make.  As you know, important decisions face
you.  College is a critical time for making choices that will impact the rest of your life. 
Keep in mind some choices and their consequences are immediate. Some are not.  For
instance, here is a balloon and a pin.  It is not hard to predict the outcome.   However, the
choices you are making at this stage of your life will not necessarily have immediate
consequences.  In fact, the consequences may take a lifetime and longer.  But, <i>&#8220;Be not
deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap&#8221;</i>
(Galatians 6:7).  The Lord calls it &#8220;The law of the harvest.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The decisions you face &#8211; how you will live your life, how you will address your studies,
whether you are going on a mission, to whom and where you will be married, how you
will raise your future children, and your careers &#8211; are of great interest not only to
President Hinckley and me but also to Heavenly Father and Satan. I want to emphasize
that you do have choices &#8211; you are free to act, to think, and to choose. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Perhaps I can illustrate <span style="font-weight: bold">the power of the priesthood ordinances in your life </span>by sharing
with you an experience that we had several years ago when Sister Sorensen and I were
serving in the Canada Halifax Mission. Sister Valerie Connors, who had been
investigating the Church, had not made much progress because she was struggling with
several personal issues. She was encouraged by the missionaries to contact the Mission
President to see if I could help her resolve some of her concerns. She had serious
conflicts with the Word of Wisdom; she was a nurse and her job often required her to
work on the Sabbath day; she recently had been through a painful divorce and had a
teenage son to rear. Furthermore, there were few incentives for her to join the church.
There were only a handful of members of the Church in the town of Windsor, Nova
Scotia, where she lived.   So there were few Church resources for her. She felt her co-workers would look down on her if she were to join the church.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#160;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">She and I met; we reviewed the beauties and blessings that the fullness of the Gospel
provides. As we talked it became clear that she had a testimony of the truthfulness of
Book of Mormon.   She realized that, in fact, she had a strong testimony of the Gospel
and the restoration of the Priesthood.  Upon realizing this, she decided what she needed
was help in acting on this knowledge. She asked for a <span style="font-weight: bold">Priesthood blessing</span> to fortify her
in her struggles against evil. After I gave her a blessing, the missionaries re-taught the
discussions, and soon she was <span style="font-weight: bold">baptized</span>. The blessings of the priesthood, including
baptism, that priesthood blessing, her <span style="font-weight: bold">patriarchal blessing,</span> and the receipt of the <span style="font-weight: bold">Holy
Ghost</span> did indeed give her strength and she was able to overcome the challenges she
faced one by one. After substantial planning, she was able to reorganize some of her
work schedule. She received divine grace as she attacked each of her problems, and
became a strong member of the church.  She has been strength to her community for over
15 years. Every year she contacts us by phone or letter.  What a tremendous difference
the Gospel had made in her life. It has helped her overcome her challenges.  She made
choices to follow the Priesthood, even in a remote corner of Canada with few other
members of the church nearby. She has helped build the Church in Nova Scotia. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Three weeks ago we heard from Valerie again. She told of new experiences that had
come this past year. She had recently been sealed in the temple to a widower from
Bountiful, Utah, who was introduced to her by a missionary couple assigned to her ward
in Nova Scotia. Embarking on a new marriage is an adventure at any time, but marrying
again in middle age, to a widower with eight children takes a lot of faith. Again, she
looked to the Priesthood for guidance regarding the choices she had to make at that time
in her life. Her example is evidence of faithful adherence to the guidance that the Gospel
provides. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Referring to marriage, let&#8217;s understand we can&#8217;t follow the trends of the world. Young
Women, &#8220;Hollywood Handsome&#8221; may not be a characteristic you&#8217;d look for in choosing
the best husband. Learn to look for more than the outward appearance when you choose
an eternal mate. When the prophet Samuel was sent to call one of the sons of Jesse as a
new king for Israel, the Lord told him not to choose the first son though he was a
handsome man.  The Lord said, <i>&#8220;Look not on his countenance, or the height of his
stature&#8230;for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward
appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart&#8221; </i>(1 Samuel 16:7).  Look for someone who
loves the Lord and has a pure heart. .  Remember, the pure in heart are the ones that see
God.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The privilege of receiving one&#8217;s temple endowment is a serious matter.  It should be
extended only to those who are sufficiently prepared and mature enough to keep the
covenants entered into.  We are concerned that an increasing number of young adults 18
years of age and older are obtaining temple recommends from their priesthood leaders to
receive their own endowment without the immediate prospect of temple marriage or full-time missionary service.  Single members in their late teens or early twenties who have
not received a mission call or who are not engaged to be married in the temple should not
be recommended to the temple for their own endowment.  They can, however, receive a
limited use recommend to perform baptisms for the dead.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">The desire to witness temple
marriages of siblings or friends is not sufficient reason to recommend one for a temple
endowment.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My young brothers and sisters, when we apply for a temple recommend, let&#8217;s tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  After all, the Holy Spirit of promise has
to verify every Priesthood ordinance. If you are lying to your bishop and the stake
president, you negate the ordinance.  President John Taylor speaks of the requirement to
&#8220;pass by&#8221; angels and Gods to enter into our exaltation. &#160;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>The time will come when we shall not only have to pass by those officers whom I
have referred to say, to have the sanction and approval of our bishop, of the
president of the stake, and of the president of the church but we are told in this
book (The Doctrine and Covenants) that we shall have to pass by the angels and
the Gods. &#160;We may have squeezed through the other; we may have got along
tolerably well, and been passed and acted upon, and sometimes a "tight squeeze"
at that. &#160;But how will it be when we get on the other side, and we have the angels
and the Gods to pass by before we can enter into our exaltation? &#160;If we cannot
pass, what then? &#160;Well, we cannot, that is all. &#160;And if we cannot, shall we be able
to enter into our exaltation? &#160;I think not. What do you think about it? &#160;</i>(Journal of
Discourses, Vol. 25, pages 161-162, June 15, 1884.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Priesthood ordinances</span> should be part of our education.  The Lord said, <i>&#8220;&#8230;in the
ordinances&#8230;the power of godliness is manifest&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 84:20). The
Temple Department and many of our temple presidents receive questions regularly
asking, &#8220;What is the temple endowment?  Why is it so important? President Brigham
Young described it this way: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Your endowment is to receive all those ordinances in the House of the Lord which
are necessary for you, after you have departed this life, to enable you to walk
back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels,
being enabled to give them the key words, the signs and tokens, pertaining to the
Holy Priesthood, and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth and hell</i>
&#160;(Journal of Discourses, Vol. 2, p. 315, April 6, 1853.).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">You are not alone in your quest for righteousness. The Lord has organized His Church
through the restoration of the priesthood so that there is accessible to every member,
man, woman, and child, a spiritual advisor and a temporal counselor who knows you and
who knows the circumstances out of which your problems come; and who, by reason of
his ordination to the Holy Priesthood, is entitled to guidance from our Heavenly Father
for the necessary discernment and inspiration of the Lord to enable him to give advice
you may need. &#160;I refer, of course, to your faithful fathers who by divine direction preside
in your homes, to your bishops and stake presidents. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As we receive counsel from our leaders, we should remember that they are the Lord's
anointed. &#160;They had hands laid on their heads and have received the priesthood keys
appointed to their calling.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When we are in trouble and need an answer to our questions, if we fast, pray and study
the scriptures and are obedient, we can receive a personal confirmation that the guidance
and direction we receive from our priesthood leaders <span style="text-decoration: underline">can be relied on</span>. &#160;A feeling of
peace, a feeling of faith that things are proper, a feeling that in time things will work out
all right can come, the still small voice of the Holy Ghost can whisper these feelings to
us.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As an illustration of <span style="font-weight: bold">the need to follow the counsel of priesthood leaders</span>, I&#8217;d like to tell
you about two elders serving in Moncton, New Brunswick. Moncton was a cold place,
both weather-wise and also in terms of the success these two particular elders were
having. They called me very discouraged after a particularly long stretch of rejection. I
suggested they consider proselyting in the near countryside where hopefully the people
would be a little friendlier. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The next day the elders drove out, parked their car, and spent the day going door to door,
without any success. When they came back just after dark to their car, they discovered
that it had been vandalized: some one had taken a &#8220;cow pie&#8221; and smeared it all across
their car&#8217;s windshield, doors, and windows. The afternoon sun had caused it to melt
through the cracks of the doors, where it had then frozen in place. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">That night I received an even more discouraged phone call from these elders. The senior
companion, Elder Cooper, was very disheartened, and felt the full brunt of rejection. He
wondered out loud over the phone whether he was worthy to be a zone leader, if they
should be transferred, or if he should just give up and go home. He just couldn&#8217;t see that
they were accomplishing anything, and felt the intense opposition of Satan. I spoke with
him for a while, and <span style="font-weight: bold">as</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">his priesthood leader I suggested</span> that they find the other elders
across town and ask for a priesthood blessing and that he and his companion recommit
themselves to the work. We talked about how difficult things had been but how important
it was that they carry on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#160;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">These elders did not know it at the time, but this was a pivotal point in their missions.
Nothing changed in the next few weeks; they chose to carry on, faithful to their calling
and in accordance with the commitments that they had chosen to accept when they
became fulltime missionaries. They <span style="font-weight: bold">received their priesthood leader&#8217;s invitation,
obeyed, and moved</span> ahead, choosing to stay focused on preaching the Gospel with love. 
To me, it was most important that they be obedient and faithful and continue to work
hard. Later in their lives, this strength of character and commitment has led to successes
in their careers and families. They now serve with distinction in their families, wards, and
communities. Their success then and their success now come from <span style="font-weight: bold">following their
priesthood leaders</span>.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">At the press conference for her receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize, Mother Theresa was
reportedly asked: &#8220;So, how do you feel, now that you have been working to feed the poor
and ease their misery for decades, and things are still just as bad in Calcutta, or worse,
than when you started?&#8221; Her profound response is an example to us all.  She said, "God
has not called me to be successful; He has called me to be faithful.&#8221;  </span></p>

Noah's day when the population of the earth was wiped out in the flood and but eight
souls were saved? &#160;Do we respond to our own seers and revelators anymore than did the

priesthood was restored by holy angels to the earth for our time, designated by the Lord
as the Fullness of Times.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have learned through personal experience after being involved in the building, open

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In closing I return to my father-in-law Les Anderson.  If you have already happened upon
some black powder and have been badly burnt, do not despair.   You have access, even
today, to be completely (and I underscore COMPLETELY) healed.  You must repent. 
The process is not easy.  You must confess; you must forsake; and you must replace bad
for good.  But if you will turn to your Father in Heaven and when necessary enlist the aid
of His agent your Bishop, I promise you in the Lord&#8217;s time you will be 100% healed. 
Determine today to repent and be healed.  Please rely upon the power of the priesthood

place in your hearts. I so bless you and express my love to you. God lives, Jesus is the
Christ.  Joseph Smith was a prophet. &#160;Christ&#8217;s Church has been restored to fulfill its

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">In 1884 a small group of courageous Latter-day Saints had ventured forth from the comparatively
mild, hospitable, and civilized climate of the Territory of Utah to settle the bleak sagebrush
plains of the Upper Snake River Valley in the territory of Idaho.  It was a daunting and
formidable task.  Throughout the course of the nineteenth century, a variety of adventurous
explorers, rough-hewn mountain men and thousands of intrepid pioneers traveling to the Oregon
Country had traversed the Snake River plain, but very few had elected to stay.  The reasons for
their disdain for this country were abundantly clear to any observer: the land was treeless,
characterized mostly by sagebrush and lava rock and suffered from unrelenting wind, persistent
cold, and little rainfall.  In sum, it was your basic barren, high mountain desert.  Early explorers,
like Captain Bonneville, described it as a <i>&#8220;vast uninhabited solitude that must forever defy
cultivation.&#8221;</i></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">These hardy Mormon pioneers had created homesteads in the Iona area, a small village located
just north of Idaho Falls.  However, the pioneers quickly became discouraged as their crops were
wiped out by numerous killing frosts during the all too short growing season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">I have to digress at this point in the story to tell you a little about how really cold it can get in
Southeast Idaho.  I know a little about these frequent frosts and chilling winds because, when I
was growing up in Idaho Falls, I saw it snow every month of the year but July.  Moreover, I am
descended of Mormon Pioneers who, after surviving the early winter snows of Wyoming with
the ill-fated Martin Handcart Company in 1856, ultimately settled east of Ashton, Idaho near the
slopes of the Tetons in an area known as Squirrel Meadows.  They had a saying about Squirrel,
that can be appreciated by those of you who have survived a hard Rexburg winter, which went
something like this: &#8220;Squirrel only has two seasons: ten months of winter and 
eight weeks of tough
sledding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">It was into the midst of these discouraged members that Wilford Woodruff and Heber J. Grant
came to address the first formal Church meeting held in the Iona area on 17 June 1884.  This
meeting was only attended by some nine to ten adults and a few children.  Significantly, one of the
adults in attendance was Thomas Ricks, whose name would figure prominently not only in the
history of the area, but also in the establishment of a small, Church academy at &#8220;Mosquito
Bend,&#8221; now known as Rexburg.  This institution, while bearing his name, would become the
largest private junior college in the United States and is now a four year university&#8212;Brigham
Young University-Idaho.  As these Saints had no chapel, the meeting was held outside and the
tailgate of a wagonbox served as the pulpit.  Pulling himself onto the wagon and looking down
on this small fellowship of Saints struggling to survive in a harsh and unforgiving environment,
Apostle Woodruff was blessed with a remarkable vision of the future of the valley and
announced the following marvelous prophecy: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The Spirit of the Lord rests mightily upon me and I feel to bless you in the name of
Jesus Christ.  I promise you that the climate will be moderated for your good.  I
can see these great sagebrush prairies, as far as the eye can reach, turned into
fertile fields.  I bless the land that it shall yield forth in its strength.  Flowers and
trees and fine homes shall grace this great valley from one end to the other. 
Schools and colleges of higher learning shall be built to serve you that you may
learn the mysteries of God&#8217;s great universe.  I see churches and meetinghouses
dotting the landscape, where the God of Israel may be worshiped in spirit and in
truth.  Yes, and as I look into the future of this great valley I can see temples&#8212;I
can see beautiful temples erected to the name of the living God where holy labors
may be carried on in his name through generations to come.</i></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">Here was a clear, prophetic and very audacious vision of the future.  We do not know what the
immediate reaction of this small congregation was to this unusual declaration.  However, I doubt
that they thought that this vision would happen automatically without their active involvement. 
Rather, I suspect that the people hearing this prophetic utterance realized that it would take both
the ardent faith and the hard, sustained work of a righteous and devoted people over an extended
period of time to bring the vision to reality.  We do know, however, that the people of Iona were
persuaded to stay in Idaho and within a relatively short time established a prosperous settlement
with a school, a meetinghouse, and other facilities like those they had left behind in Utah.</span>&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 12pt">  But,
it also seems quite likely that Elder Woodruff had envisioned something on a grander scale than
a small, but successful agricultural village on the edge of civilization.  Instead, my sense is he
had glimpsed the larger possibilities for the future in this particular part of the Lord&#8217;s vineyard
which are still unfolding today.  Let&#8217;s take a closer look, with the hindsight perspective of 120
years, at how the vision has been fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">The first, and perhaps most striking element of the vision, is the promise that the climate would
be moderated for the good of the settlers.  How was this to be accomplished?  Indeed, there may
be some of you from warmer climes like Southern California and Arizona who wonder if this
part of the prophecy was actually fulfilled.  At first glance, climate moderation would appear to
be something uniquely within the providence of God.  Even today with sophisticated satellite
technology and computer modeling, the task of predicting the weather, let alone changing it,
seems beyond the ability of mere mortals.  Nevertheless, there are instances when the people&#8217;s
exercise of faith can have a moderating effect on the weather.  Back in 1977-78, Southeast Idaho,
like in recent years, was in the grip of a devastating drought.  This is, after all, a desert where
precipitation is always going to be sparse and unpredictable.  The stakes in Idaho Falls where I
was working that summer organized a vigil of prayer and fasting to the end that the Lord would
moderate the weather for their good.  I wondered at the time at their use of language&#8212;why ask
for the weather to be moderated, why not simply ask for more rain?  After participating with our
stake in the fast, I was impressed to observe that while the historic amount of rain received in the
spring and summer did not appreciably change, the timing of the rain was such that the non-irrigated dry farms in the region got the needed rain at the proper time and in the proper amounts
to ensure a bumper crop.  From this perspective, I have no doubt that the Lord&#8217;s hand has been
manifest in moderating the climate in our mountain valleys to allow for productive agriculture. 
However, I am also satisfied that the active faith and work of the people of the area in building
large dams and irrigation projects has also contributed hugely to making agriculture successful in
Southeast Idaho.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">A second element of the vision is the dramatic transformation of the sagebrush prairie into
verdant, fertile fields <i>&#8220;as far as the eye can reach.&#8221;</i>  Although I provide legal services for BYU-Idaho, my office is located on the campus of BYU in Provo.  I am able to do this largely because
of modern electronic communication technology.  Nevertheless, face-to-face communication is
still very important in giving good legal advice, and, as a result, I travel from Provo to Rexburg
by car along I-15 on a regular basis.  I have made this trip numerous times and, believe me, I am
very familiar with the landscape along the way.  As you travel through Northern Utah, you really
see very little in the way of agriculture.  The landscape is dominated by increasingly crowded
cities to the east and a barren Great Salt Lake to the west.  On entering Idaho, one first navigates
the Malad Pass and then travels through Marsh Valley which is still characterized by sagebrush
and lava flows and probably doesn&#8217;t look a whole lot different today than it did in Brigham
Young&#8217;s time.  Finally, the road bends north around Pocatello bringing into view the great Snake
River Plain.  In the high summer as I head north up the valley, I am amazed, no matter how may
times I have made the drive, by the immense and fruitful land <i>&#8220;as far as the eye can reach&#8221;</i> of
miles upon miles of cultivated fields stretching out across the plain; and, yes, there are flowers
and trees, an abundance of fine homes and LDS meetinghouses complete with conspicuous
satellite dishes.  It is a glorious view, but it did not spring spontaneous from the ground after
Elder Woodruff climbed down from the wagonbox in 1884.  Rather, the Saints and their
neighbors of other faiths spent decades digging, mostly by hand and by horse, a grand and
elaborate system of reservoirs and canals to channel the flow of the surging Snake River into the
desert plain and, literally and miraculously transformed the land which, it turned out, was
perfectly suited for raising world famous potatoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">Another element of the vision is the concluding pinnacle of achievement&#8212;the erection of<i>
&#8220;beautiful temples.&#8221;</i>  This is a remarkable statement because at that time the only operating
temples were the St. George Temple (1877) and the Logan, Utah Temple (1884).</span>&nbsp;

  }
</script>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">  Moreover,
note that this reference to temples is in the plural.  The decision to build the first temple in Idaho
in Idaho Falls was made in 1936.</span>&nbsp;
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">  At that time, the construction of temples was largely financed
by the local members.  In the 1930s, the United States was, as you will recall, in the midst of the
greatest economic disaster this country has ever experienced.  We now refer to it as the Great
Depression.  This was not a particularly opportune time for the local farmers, ranchers, and small
businessmen in the area to raise the money to build a large, beautiful temple on the banks of the
Snake River.  But they persisted in the face of great economic obstacles, laying the cornerstone in
1940.</span>&nbsp;
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">  The construction of the temple was then delayed when the United States entered World
War II, an epic world-wide struggle against the dark forces of Fascism and militarism.  However,
by the conclusion of the war, the Idaho Falls Temple was dedicated in September 1945 by
President George Albert Smith as the then eighth operating LDS temple.</span>&nbsp;

    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">The dedication of the Idaho Falls Temple was not only in partial fulfillment of Elder Woodruff&#8217;s
vision, it was also a beacon of light and hope to a war torn world and the harbinger of the many
temples that would be built around the globe.  As you are probably aware, the second Idaho
temple (26<sup>th</sup> in the world) was dedicated in Boise in 1984 and the Church as just announced a
third temple in Idaho to be built in Rexburg.  There are presently 115 dedicated temples world
wide.</span>&nbsp;

  }
</script>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">  I think it is safe to predict that in the process of time there will be other temples that will
dot the land along the Snake River crescent and elsewhere in Idaho.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">If you have been following the order of the elements articulated in Elder Woodruff&#8217;s vision, you
will have noted that I temporarily skipped over the promise of the establishment of <i>&#8220;schools and
colleges of higher learning.&#8221;</i>  I have done this because I wanted to address this element in a little
more detail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">My favorite picture of the BYU-Idaho campus is what I believe to be the earliest known photo,
taken by an unknown photographer, of the Spori building around 1905.  I will not take the time
to recount here how under the inspired leadership of Thomas E. Ricks an academy was
established for the education of the youth of the Bannock Stake in 1888 except to note that this
was at a time when the legislature of the Idaho Territory had passed a Test Oath Act which
required all male citizens of the territory, as a condition to voting or holding public office, to
affirm that he was not a member of the Mormon Church.</span>&nbsp;
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '&lt;span id="WPEndnote9" class="WPFloatStyle"&gt;' );
    document.write( WPEndnote9 );
    document.write( '&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPEndnote9\')"&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;' );
    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">  Thus, it was at a time of both great
poverty and persecution that the academy was begun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">There is a saying that a picture is worth a thousand words and I think that is certainly true in this
case.  The woman is standing in what is now a center part of the campus.  I think it is interesting
and instructive to observe the vegetation or lack thereof.  The sagebrush is short, stunted and
sparse.  There is more than a hint of chilly weather with the slight touch of snow around the
brush.  In the center of the picture is the massive Spori Building, constructed in the rough and
rugged lava rock terrain, but in an elevated area where it could be seen from miles around.  The
building itself is made of sturdy stone with thick imposing walls.  It seems almost like a citadel
with the subliminal message that the people who built it were permanent residents who would
not be moved out of their place.  The cost of the structure is believe to be around $40,000, a huge
sum at the turn of the nineteenth century.</span>&nbsp;
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '&lt;span id="WPEndnote10" class="WPFloatStyle"&gt;' );
    document.write( WPEndnote10 );
    document.write( '&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPEndnote10\')"&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;' );
    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">  For me, the most interesting part of the photo is the
community backdrop.  There are a few modest frame houses, some out buildings and corrals, but
nothing that would remotely suggest that this community had the economic resources to
construct such an imposing building.  You have to admire these folks for the sacrifice that must
have been required to build the Spori Building in the time of their poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">The battle to establish a faith-based institution of higher education would, of course, extend well
beyond the initial, albeit impressive, start with the Spori Building.  I believe that every individual
who has the special privilege and blessing of attending this great Church university should know
something about its miraculous history.  I say &#8220;miraculous&#8221; because it is nothing short of a
miracle that BYU-Idaho exists today.  Time does not allow a full recounting of all the times this
institution teetered on the edge of oblivion only to be pulled back time and again by the sacrifice
and determination of those who loved her so well.  For example, of the some 27 Church
academies established in the nineteenth century, only two: BYU in Provo and BYU-Idaho in
Rexburg, are still affiliated with the Church today.  The others either faded away or were taken
over by the state.  Through all this travail and uncertainty, the hand of the Lord was with the
school as it first survived and then slowly grew and then came to thrive as it does today.</span>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">My association with Ricks College and with what many people have come to call the &#8220;Spirit of
Ricks&#8221; began in 1982.  At that time I was a much younger lawyer in the private practice in Idaho
Falls, and I was blessed with the opportunity to combine my professional training in the law with
my love of higher education.  Since 1982, I have had the wonderful experience of associating
with four different presidents of this great institution and to observe closely how they have used
their own unique talents, experience, and personality to foster the growth and development of the
school.  Upon reflection, I have concluded that each was an inspired choice who was a very good
fit for the particular challenges of his administration.  In keeping with the general theme of my
talk today, each President developed a vision of what he was charged to accomplish and through
the exercise of faith in the vision and sustained, hard work was able to make meaningful progress
towards implementing that vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">President Bruce C. Hafen was the President of Ricks College from 1978 to 1985.  To me,
President Hafen was something of a Renaissance man.  He was a law professor with a national
reputation in the field of children&#8217;s rights, enjoyed the fine arts, and even participated as a pianist
in a faculty quartet.  He was also renowned for his polished and insightful speeches to the faculty
and student body.  One of the things that President Hafen did on occasion was to invite small
groups of his Ricks College colleagues to his home for dinner.  On one such occasion, my wife,
Dottie, and I were invited to attend.  During the course of our conversation, I asked President
Hafen what he hoped to accomplish while President at Ricks College.  (I have to pause here and
point out the Forrest Gump-like quality of my personal experiences with these presidents.  I
didn&#8217;t make much of a contribution to the growth and development of Ricks, but I liked to be
around those who did.)  As I recall his response, he said that he had come to believe that Ricks
College was, unfortunately, one of the best kept secrets in the Church and that the public
perception of Ricks needed to come up to the actual reality.  Also, using a golfing analogy, he
indicated that despite the fact that Ricks was a very fine college, there were still areas where it
needed to &#8220;get out of the rough and onto the green.&#8221;  I felt that by the conclusion of his term as
President, he had gotten the word out to the Church that Ricks College was a first-rate school and
that many programs had been markedly improved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">I can&#8217;t pass by President Hafen without mentioning his delightful sense of humor.  I have to
confess that sometimes I didn&#8217;t get the point of his puns, but I nevertheless chortled for
days&#8212;after all, he was the President.  I do remember the telling of one joke which I thought
captured his rather unique sense of humor.  One day we were walking across campus in the late
winter.  It had been a particularly brutal winter, even by Rexburg standards, and the snow was
flying at us driven by a forty mile an hour wind.  As we struggled to make our way, President
Hafen turned to me and said, &#8220;Mike, Ricks College is a special place.&#8221;  &#8220;How so,&#8221; I cautiously
responded as bits of ice and snow stung my face.  &#8220;Well,&#8221; he continued above the howl of the
wind, &#8220;In the Church, many are called, but few are frozen.&#8221;  His humor warmed me up on a cold
and blustery day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">President Joe J. Christensen presided over Ricks College from 1985 to 1989.   He was a wise
person who came to Ricks with years of experience in the Church Education System.   While in
Rexburg, he planned and carried out a successful centennial celebration of the founding of Ricks
College.  Like his predecessor, President Christensen was a deeply spiritual person who thought
very carefully about how his decisions would impact individual members of the campus
community.  He must have also been an early riser because I received a couple of unexpected
phone calls from his office at 6 a.m. in the morning!  I tried to sound awake and alert, but I doubt
he was fooled.  But, what impressed me the most about President Christensen was his sense of
fairness and good judgement.  It seemed like every time we discussed a particularly knotty
problem he would remark &#8220;it&#8217;s a mighty thin pancake that doesn&#8217;t have two sides&#8221; and then
would, in a very even-handed manner, carefully analyze the situation from a number of different
perspectives.  Once, after a particularly long and challenging day, we were alone in his office and
I asked him what he thought would be his most significant contribution to the school.  Without
hesitation, he said that he had the final say in the hiring of faculty and that his most enduring
contribution would be the hiring of faculty who were both excellent teachers and role models for
students in the living of the restored gospel.  In my experience with talking to people throughout
the Church, this institution has a very enviable reputation in both areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">President Steven D. Bennion was the President of Ricks College from 1989 until 1997.  President
Bennion seemed particularly well prepared to assume the leadership at the college.  He had prior
experience as a college president at Snow College and had a doctorate degree in higher education
administration.  In addition to his impressive educational and professional qualifications,
President Bennion had a remarkably outgoing personality.  It seemed to me that within a few
days of taking the helm, he knew the names and backgrounds of everyone who worked at Ricks. 
He had a powerfully inclusive aura about him that helped make Ricks, more than ever, a united
campus community, without guile, and of one heart and one mind.  I remember that President
Bennion was inaugurated in November of 1989 when the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were
being unexpectedly transformed before our very eyes.  At that time, it was obvious to everyone
that the 1990s would be a time of accelerated and profound change.  President Bennion met the
challenge of change by not only building on the existing strengths of the college, but also by
emphasizing the acquisition of new computer technology and pulling into place the long-range
planning for space, facilities, and admissions standards that foreshadowed the dramatic changes
to the campus which were to occur shortly into the twenty-first century.  In the end, however, I
believe President Bennion&#8217;s chief accomplishment was in building and serving people with great
love and humility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">Dr. David A. Bednar became the President of Ricks College on July 1, 1997.  He was a business
management professor from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and an Area Authority
Seventy.  I don&#8217;t think he had ever set foot on this campus before his appointment.  When
President Bednar arrived in Rexburg, he found the largest private junior college in America with
excellent facilities, fine academic programs, wonderful faculty, and about 7,500 faithful students. 
President Bednar made an immediate positive impact on the campus with his positive, energetic
leadership style and it seemed to me that his administration would likely build on the existing
strengths of the institution, with more efficiency, raising the bar both in terms of academic
quality and spiritual growth, but without any fundamental shift in direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">Indeed, from time to time people would ask me if I thought Ricks College would ever be made a
four-year school.  Even though I was aware that Ricks College had briefly been a four-year
school in the early 1950s when my parents had attended, I was absolutely convinced that Ricks
College would never again be a four-year institution because the cost of operating a full-fledged
university is very high and because of the growing financial burden of sustaining an increasingly
world-wide Church.  Given this point of reference, I was stunned to hear the announcement from
President Hinckley that Ricks College was to become Brigham Young University-Idaho, a four-year, degree-granting university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">Obviously, making the transition from a junior college to a university would be enormously
challenging.  However, as the details of the transition began to emerge, it became increasingly
evident that the vision for BYU-Idaho was much more profound and fundamental than making
another brand-name BYU to join the ranks of BYU in Provo and BYU-Hawaii.  Rather, BYU-Idaho would be a daring and innovative new model for Church higher education.  For the first
time, the three semester track would be rigorously used to extend the blessings of a BYU-Idaho
education to many more students by making the Winter, Fall, and Summer Semesters
substantially equivalent in terms of classes, programs, and activities.  The resources going into
intercollegiate athletics would be transferred into a massive student activities program where the
student body would be participants rather than spectators.  Moreover, a tightly focused &#8220;school to
work&#8221; program correlating curriculum and internships for most students would be established.  In
order to achieve this, many programs would have to be redesigned, others created, and some
discontinued while building new facilities and hiring new faculty.  All this was to be done with
the charge to preserve the &#8220;Spirit of Ricks&#8221;&#8212;the friendly, close, and student-oriented atmosphere
which everyone feels while on this campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">As I pondered the nature of this task, it occurred to me that this would be analogous to converting
a battleship into an aircraft carrier without the benefit of a dry dock and without ceasing navel
operations.  The task would take years of careful planning, inspired direction, and sustained
sacrifice to achieve.  However, in the first three years of this transformation, one can already see
a <i>&#8220;miracle&#8221;</i> taking place.  The Lord had prepared a remarkable new group of highly qualified
faculty to strengthen the ranks of an already strong faculty corps.  Better prepared students are
coming to all the tracks.  The activities and internship programs are off to impressive starts. 
And, all around us, new construction is going forward.  All of this has taken place in the face of a
serious and sustained economic downturn and without changing the essential good qualities
inherent in the Spirit of Ricks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">Sometimes I wonder if Elder Woodruff, in peering down the corridors of time back in 1884,
didn&#8217;t get at least a glimpse of this wonderful institution with its thousands of clear-eyed and
purposeful students and committed and caring faculty studying and learning in the midst of
construction cranes.  While the transition from Ricks College to BYU-Idaho is not yet complete,
I am confident that it will be a resounding success and be a lasting legacy attributable to
President Hinckley&#8217;s inspired vision and to President Bednar and the rest of the campus
community who are rethinking education and working tirelessly to bring about the reality of that
vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">To this point in my address, I have suggested that the Lord and his prophets had a vision not only
for the future of this valley, but also for the future of this school.  This vision, however, was not
self-executing.  Instead, it was and continues to be implemented through the exercise of faith and
the hard intellectual and physical work of those who care.  It should also be obvious to us that the
implementation of this vision is an ongoing work in progress that will continue on to the
millennium and beyond.  This raises the very provocative and highly relevant question of what is
expected of each of us in the here and now to do our part to move this great enterprise forward. 
Our time here today does not allow a full discussion of the parameters of this question which, in
the end, can probably be best answered in a private and individual way.  Nevertheless, I would
like to offer up a few thoughts to ponder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">Like many of you, I decorate my office with a number of photos and mementoes to remind me
why I am at work.  Among these are pictures of my family to remind me to be a good husband
and a good father.  I also have portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and a scene
from our nation&#8217;s capital to remind me of the blessings of freedom and the responsibilities that
go with it.  Being a lawyer, I have on display my admission to the Bar of the United State
Supreme Court and some art representing lawyers negotiating contracts, arguing cases in court,
and counseling with clients.  I even have an old football poster of BYU&#8217;s 1984 National
Championship team to remind me of the possibility of becoming recognized as the best in the
land.  Finally, I also have a small postcard of a scene that is visible from the third floor of the
Administration Building at BYU where I have spent many long hours these past 15 years.  In this
postcard, one can see two structures which, to me, have significant symbolic meaning.  The first
structure is the Carillon Bell Tower.  The tower is a tall and elegant structure.  Frequently, the
bells chime out wonderful music both secular and religious.  It was built to commemorate the
100 year anniversary of the founding of BYU and represents to me the ongoing challenge of all
three BYUs to <i>&#8220;seek learning, even by study and also by faith.&#8221;</i></span>&nbsp;
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '&lt;span id="WPEndnote12" class="WPFloatStyle"&gt;' );
    document.write( WPEndnote12 );
    document.write( '&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPEndnote12\')"&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;' );
    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">  Beyond the tower is the Provo
Temple where sacred ordinances are performed and solemn covenants with God are entered into. 
On the one hand we have the University, one of the great treasures and successes of western
civilization, celebrating reason, discourse, and discovery.  At the BYUs, these goals are sought in
an atmosphere of faith and civility as evidenced in our Honor Code.  On the other hand, we have
the temple, a symbol of our spiritual quest to have direct revelation from God confirming to us in
spirit-to-spirit communication the most important eternal truths.  Please note that in this picture
the bell tower and the temple are in nearly perfect alignment.  It seems to me to be no accident
that on the literal doorsteps of BYU, BYU-Hawaii, and now BYU-Idaho there are or shortly will
be a temple to assist the faculty and students to align their lives and their studies with eternal and
unchanging principles of the restored gospel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">It is a special privilege to attend one of the BYUs.  As you were growing up, you probably were
reminded by your parents on more than one occasion that where &#8220;much is given, much is
required.&#8221;  Those of us who enjoy the blessings of attending and working at these great Church
universities have a concomitant responsibility to not only keep our lives aligned with Gospel
principles, but also to give back to the kingdom.  As these increasingly large graduating classes
of BYU students move out into the world, they should be among the vanguard and leaders of the
children of light in an increasingly darkening world.  Through personal prayer, the reading of the
scriptures and your patriarchal blessings, and through quiet and careful thought and meditation,
the Lord will, in the process of time, reveal his plan or vision for you as you keep your life
aligned with His values and commandments.  But, make no mistake, how well you are prepared
to receive and fulfill this role will depend in large part on the decisions and the effort you put
forth while a student here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">Today I have talked about a number of topics which I hope were somewhat related.  I have
attempted to point out that the Lord articulated through his servants a remarkable vision not only
for this geographical area in general, but also for BYU-Idaho; that our predecessors have done a
marvelous work in bringing about this vision; and that we all have a continuing and individual
work to do to continue to build on this legacy which will be successful to the extent we correctly
align ourselves with gospel principles and make the personal effort to find our own vision and
work to make it happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">In conclusion, I want to relate one recent experience, that could have happened at any of our
BYUs, that I had which convinced me that your generation is certainly up to the task of moving
the kingdom to much higher ground&#8212;that the best is yet to come.  This fall, the BYU Honor
Code Office invited me to watch a presentation on the Honor Code by some upperclassmen to
the freshman in Freshman Orientation.  I was quite impressed by the upperclassmen&#8217;s skill and
humor in setting forth the expectations for the new students with masterful presentations through
skits, film, and music.  By the end, they seemed to have convinced everyone that not only was
living the Honor Code the right thing to do, it was also the fun thing to do.  As I looked over this
freshman crowd of about 4,000 in the Marriott Center, I realized that while they came from all
over the country and even from some foreign countries, they were all bound together, united in a
common testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.  At the end of the program, this diverse
group of freshmen was asked to sing a medley of those great youth anthems&#8212;&#8220;Army of
Helaman&#8221; and &#8220;As Sisters in Zion.&#8221;  There was no practice time and no handouts with the words
to the hymns.  Notwithstanding this, the freshmen gave a seamless and inspiring rendition that
was worthy of any choir.  As they sang, the spirit impressed upon me that this was indeed a royal
and chosen generation, unique and remarkable in all the world, fully capable of accelerating the
Lord&#8217;s work in these latter days.  May it be so, I pray, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, 
amen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Some time ago I sat in my home ward and listened with much interest as four children moved to
the front of the chapel and in turn bore their testimonies. The first one could not have been more
than seven years old, and yet she spoke with a confidence that one might expect from a seasoned
adult member of the Church. She said, essentially, &#8220;I want to bear my testimony that I know that
the Church is true, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that President Gordon B.
Hinckley is our living prophet today.&#8221; She then shared some personal feelings and sat down. I
pondered on her words, on the depth of sincerity evident in her voice, and I wondered: <span style="text-decoration: underline">Does</span> she
know? Does she <span style="text-decoration: underline">really</span> know? How much <span style="text-decoration: underline">could</span> she know? Later during the day I reflected on the
experience and had affirmed to my mind and heart that little children can come to know the
things of God, by the power of the Spirit of God, (1 Corinthians 2:11-14) and can speak words of
truth and wisdom, just as their adult counterparts can (Alma 32:23). A testimony is not
something you either have or don&#8217;t have, but rather an impression of the Spirit as to the
truthfulness of eternal things, an inner awareness that ranges along a spiritual continuum from a
simple peaceful feeling to a perfect knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It has wisely been observed that the strength of this Church lies not alone in the powerful
witnesses of the fifteen men we sustain as prophets, seers and revelators, but rather the deep
reassurance and resolve that rests in the souls of individual Saints of the Most High from
Alabama to Zanzibar. A testimony may begin through trusting in and relying upon the witness of
another, of one who knows for sure; to believe on the faith of another is indeed a spiritual gift, a
gift that can lead to eternal life (Doctrine and Covenants 46:13-14). And yet surely each one of us
desires to possess our own witness, an independent knowledge of the reality of God our Father,
the redemptive mission of Jesus the Christ, and the divine call of Joseph Smith and the work of
the Restoration. It was President Heber C. Kimball that warned us of a test to come, a test that
would separate out those who professed membership in the Church but did not possess a personal
testimony sufficient to see them through hard times. <i>&#8220;The time will come when no man or
woman will be able to endure on borrowed light,&#8221; </i>he said. <i>&#8220;Each will have to be guided by the
light within himself. If you do not have it, how can you stand?&#8221; </i>(Orson F. Whitney, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Life of Heber
C. Kimball</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1973, 446, 449-50).</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Faith in the Unseen</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A few years ago a Baptist minister friend and I were driving through Boston in an effort to get to
the LDS Institute of Religion at Cambridge. As has been my custom most every time I have been
to Boston, I was absolutely lost and had no idea where we were. We stopped several times for
directions, and each helpful person would point to us the way and say with much assurance &#8220;You
can&#8217;t miss it.&#8221; After having heard that phrase five or six times, I asked our seventh helper for
directions and began my question with &#8220;Please don&#8217;t say you can&#8217;t miss it, because I assure you
that we can, for we have done it again and again.&#8221; During our scavenger hunt of sorts, we
chatted. My colleague commented on a matter that we had discussed several times, namely the
idea that Latter-day Saints are more prone to rely upon feelings than tangible evidence for truth
of religious claims. In response, I asked: &#8220;Do you believe in the literal bodily resurrection of
Jesus Christ?&#8221; The look he gave me was similar to that which a sixteen-year-old would give to
someone who had asked what the teenager felt to be an inane question. &#8220;Of course I believe in
the resurrection, Bob; I&#8217;m an ordained minister.&#8221; I followed up: &#8220;Why do you believe in the
resurrection? How do you know it really happened?&#8221; He answered: &#8220;Because the New Testament
teaches of the resurrection of Jesus.&#8221; I shot right back &#8220;But how do you know that the New
Testament accounts can be trusted? How do you know the Bible can be trusted?  Maybe someone
just made all of this up. Maybe the Bible is a giant hoax.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;There is strong evidence to support the truthfulness of the Bible.&#8221; &#8220;Like what?&#8221; I
asked. &#8220;Well, there are archaeological, historical and cultural evidences that what is being
described actually happened.&#8221; I then queried. &#8220;And so that&#8217;s how you know the resurrection is
real?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;Yeah, I suppose so,&#8221; he said. At this point my mind began to race. And I found myself saying
something I hadn&#8217;t planned to say. &#8220;You know, I feel a great sense of sadness right now.&#8221; My
Evangelical friend was surprised and asked &#8220;Sadness? Why are you sad?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;I was just thinking of a good friend of mine, an older woman in Montgomery, Alabama.&#8221; My
partner asked: &#8220;What about her?&#8221; I then said, &#8220;Well, I was thinking of how sad it is that this
wonderful and devoted Christian, a person who has given her life to Jesus and studied and
memorized her Bible like few people I know, a woman whose life manifests her complete
commitment to the Savior, is not really entitled to have a witness of the truthfulness of the
Bible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;Why is that?&#8221; he followed up. &#8220;Well, she knows precious little about archaeology or languages
or culture or history or manuscripts, and so I suppose she can&#8217;t really know within her heart that
the Bible really is the word of God.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;Of course she can,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She can have her faith, her personal witness that the Bible is true.&#8221;
I pulled off to the side of the road and stopped the car. I turned to him, smiled, and stated: &#8220;Do
you mean that she can have the power of the Holy Spirit testify to her soul that her Bible is
completely trustworthy and can be relied upon as God&#8217;s word?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what I mean.&#8221; My smile broadened as I added: &#8220;Then we&#8217;ve come full circle.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; he asked. I said: &#8220;You&#8217;re telling me that this good woman, one
who has none of the supposed requisite background or knowledge of external evidence, can have
a witness of the Spirit, including deep personal feelings about the Bible and that those feelings
are genuine and heaven-sent.&#8221; At that point my friend looked into my eyes and he smiled. &#8220;I see
where you&#8217;re going with this.&#8221; We then engaged in one of the most productive conversations of
our time together as friends. We agreed between us that it is so easy to yield to the temptation to
categorize and pigeonhole and stereotype and even demonize persons whose faith is different
than your own. It is so easy to overstate, to misrepresent, to create &#8220;straw men&#8221; in an effort to
establish your own point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We agreed that &#8220;traditional Christians&#8221; and Latter-day Saint Christians both base their faith upon
evidence&#8212;both seen and unseen. While saving faith is always built upon that which is true, upon
an actual historical moment in time, upon something that really existed in the past, true believers
will never allow their faith to be held hostage by what science has or has not found at a given
time. I know, for example, that Jesus fed the 5,000, healed the sick, raised the dead, calmed the
storm, and rose from the dead&#8212;not just because I have physical evidence for each of those
miraculous events (because I do not), nor even because I can read of these things in the New
Testament, which I accept with all my heart. But I know these things actually happened because
the Spirit of the Living God bears witness to my spirit that the Lord of Life did all the scriptures
say he did, and more. </span></p>

me to rehearse the ontological, the teleological, and the cosmological arguments

think I&#8217;ll remind Jeffrey about Karl Barth, arguably the most important
theologian of the twentieth century. Toward the end of his life, after he had
written volume after volume on the transcendence of God and the centrality of
Jesus, Barth was asked to sum up his work. The good doctor paused for a minute
and no doubt looked out the window and played with the stubble on his chin
before responding with the words of a Sunday school ditty: &#8220;Jesus loves me, this I
know, for the Bible tells me so&#8221; </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">Growing Pains: Learning to Love my Father&#8217;s
Faith</span> (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Brazos Press, 2001), 34, 61-62).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Many years ago on a Sunday morning I opened the door and reached down to pick up the
morning newspaper when I saw beside the paper a plastic bag containing a paperback book. I
brought both inside and laid the newspaper aside as I browsed the paperback. The cover was a
lovely picture of a mountain stream, but the title of the book revealed to me what in fact the book
was all about&#8212;it was an anti-Mormon treatise. Many of the arguments in the book against The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were old and worn-out ones, dead horses that have
been beaten since the days of E. D. Howe. Latter-day Saints had responded to the issues posed
scores of times, but they continued to crop up. One section of the book did prove, however, to be
of some interest to me. Let me paraphrase what was essentially said about 130 pages into the
text. The author pointed out that eventually two Mormon missionaries would come to the
reader&#8217;s door. If they do come, he pleaded, don&#8217;t let them in. If, however, you do let them in, then
don&#8217;t listen to them. If they are allowed to tell you about their message, about Joseph Smith and
angels and golden plates, they will ask you to kneel and pray about the truthfulness of these
things. Whatever you do, don&#8217;t pray! The writer then made this unusual observation: In
ascertaining the truthfulness of a religious claim, there are three things a person can never trust:
(1) your thoughts; (2) your feelings; (3) your prayers. I was all ears at this point, wondering how
we could ever know anything. I didn&#8217;t have to wait long, for the writer then noted that the only
thing that could be trusted was the Holy Bible itself. I shook my head and felt a deep sense of
sadness for the author, for I wondered how indeed a person could even know of the truthfulness
of the Bible if he or she could not think, feel, or pray. I had a collage of feelings at that moment.
As indicated, I felt sad for the writer, for it was obvious that he could not see the blatant
inconsistency and irrationality of his own words. I tried to put myself into the place of a reader
who was not a Latter-day Saint and wondered how I might feel upon reading such things. To be
honest, I would feel insulted, knowing that I could not be trusted enough in my pursuit of truth to
rely upon my mind, my heart, or even the most tried and true method of obtaining divine
direction&#8212;prayer itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">An Evangelical Christian colleague, Craig Blomberg, once observed: &#8220;You know, it&#8217;s ironic: The
Bible considers it praiseworthy to have a faith that does not require evidence. Remember how
Jesus replied to doubting Thomas: &#8216;You believe because you see; blessed are those who have not
seen and yet believe.&#8217; And I know evidence can never compel or coerce faith. We cannot
supplant the role of the Holy Spirit, which is often a concern of Christians when they hear
discussions of this kind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;But I&#8217;ll tell you this; there are plenty of stories of scholars in the New Testament field who have
not been Christians, yet through their study of these very issues have come to faith in Christ. And
there have been countless more scholars, already believers, whose faith has been made stronger,
more solid, more grounded, because of the evidence&#8212;and that&#8217;s the category I fall into&#8221; (Cited in
Lee Strobel, <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Case for Christ</span> (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan) 1998), 52-53).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In writing of faith in the unseen, a Roman Catholic New Testament scholar, Luke Timothy
Johnson, explained: &#8220;Belief in the existence of God is already an act by which one &#8216;entrusts&#8217;
oneself to a world that is not entirely defined by what can be seen and counted, heard, and
accounted for.&#8221; Further: &#8220;Christians need to begin by insisting, first of all to themselves, then to
each other, and finally to the world, that faith itself is a way of knowing reality. They need to
insist that faith establishes contact with reality in a way different from, but no less real than, the
very limited (though, in their fashion, extremely impressive) ways of knowing by which the
wheels of the world&#8217;s empirical engine are kept spinning.&#8221; As an illustration, &#8220;If religion can
hold as true only what is &#8216;within the bounds of reason,&#8217; and if &#8216;reason&#8217; is defined in terms of the
empirically verifiable, then the resurrection is excluded by definition. But if the resurrection is
excluded, why should Christians continue to revere Jesus, who is then only one of many figures
from antiquity worthy of attention and honor?&#8221; (<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Creed: What Christians Believe and Why It
Matters </span>(New York: Doubleday, 2003), 45, 101, 180).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">True believers will always be challenged by those who refuse to see. In a very real sense,
believing is seeing. No member of the Church need feel embarrassed when they cannot produce
the golden plates or the complete Egyptian papyrus. No member of this Church should ever feel
hesitant to bear testimony of those verities that remain in the realm of faith, that are seen only
with the eyes of faith. Elder Neal A. Maxwell has written: &#8220;It is the author&#8217;s opinion that all the
scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, will remain in the realm of faith. Science will not be
able to prove or disprove holy writ. However, enough plausible evidence will come forth to
prevent scoffers from having a field day, but not enough to remove the requirement of faith.
Believers must be patient during such unfoldingâ (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Plain and Precious Things</span> (Salt Lake City:
Deseret Book, 1983), 4.).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Similarly, President Ezra Taft Benson pointed out: &#8220;We do not have to prove the Book of
Mormon is true. The book is its own proof. All we need to do is read it and declare it. The Book
of Mormon is not on trial&#8212;the people of the world, including the members of the Church, are on
trial as to what they will do with this second witness for Christ&#8221; (<span style="text-decoration: underline">A 
Witness and a Warning</span> (Salt
Lake City: Deseret Book, 1988), 13).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;We are not required to prove that the Book of Mormon is true or is an authentic record through
external evidences&#8212;though there are many. It never has been the case, nor is it so now, that the
studies of the learned will prove the Book or Mormon true or false. The origin, preparation,
translation, and verification of the truth of the Book of Mormon have all been retained in the
hands of the Lord, and the Lord makes no mistakes. You can be assured of that&#8221; (<span style="text-decoration: underline">A Witness and a
Warning</span>, 31).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Gordon B. Hinckley put things in proper perspective when he taught: &#8220;I can hold [the
Book of Mormon] in my hand. It is real. It has weight and substance that can be physically
measured. I can open its pages and read, and it has language both beautiful and uplifting. The
ancient record from which it was translated came out of the earth as a voice speaking from the
dust. . . . </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;The evidence for its truth, for its validity in a world that is prone to demand evidence, lies not in
archaeology or anthropology, though these may be helpful to some. It lies not in word research or
historical analysis, though these may be confirmatory. The evidence for its truth and validity lies
within the covers of the book itself. The test of its truth lies in reading it. It is a book of God.
Reasonable individuals may sincerely question its origin, but those who read it prayerfully may
come to know by a power beyond their natural senses that it is true, that it contains the word of
God, that it outlines saving truths of the everlasting gospel, that it came forth by the gift and
power of God.&#8221; (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Faith: The Essence of True Religion</span> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1989), 10-11.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We place a great deal of emphasis in this Church&#8212;as we should&#8212;upon the singular role of the
Book of Mormon, of its vital place in our own witness of the overall truthfulness of the restored
gospel. In the meridian of time, the resurrection of the Master stood as the physical evidence for
the Savior&#8217;s divine Sonship, the tangible witness that Jesus was Lord. Either he rose from the
dead, as he said he would, or he was a fraud and Christianity was a giant hoax. So with our own
dispensation: the Book of Mormon stands as the tangible evidence of a spiritual reality&#8212;that
God has spoken anew in our day; has made known his mind and will and purposes through
Joseph Smith and his prophetic and apostolic successors; that The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints is in deed and in fact the kingdom of God on earth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Recently President James E. Faust  told the story of a Latter-day Saint lecturer at London
University, Joseph Hamstead. Brother Hamstead once spoke to a group at the university of the
LDS faith, including its youth and family programs. One of those in attendance responded as
follows: &#8220;I like all of this, what is being done for families, etc. If you could take out that bit about
an angel appearing to Joseph Smith, I could belong to your church.&#8221; Hamstead retorted: &#8220;Ah, but
if you take away the angel appearing to the Prophet Joseph, then I couldn&#8217;t belong to the Church
because that is its foundation&#8221; (Personal correspondence to James E. Faust; cited in Faust, &#8220;Lord,
I Believe; Help Thou Mine Unbelief,&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, November 2003, 19-20).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has written: &#8220;To consider that everything of saving significance in the
Church stands or falls on the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon and, by implication, the
Prophet Joseph Smith&#8217;s account of how it came forth is as sobering as it is true. It is a &#8216;sudden
death&#8217; proposition. Either the Book of Mormon is what the Prophet Joseph said it is, or this
Church and its founder are false, a deception from the first instance onward. . . . Joseph Smith
must be accepted either as a prophet of God or else as a charlatan of the first order, but no one
should tolerate any ludicrous, even laughable middle ground about the contours of a young boy&#8217;s
imagination or his remarkable facility for turning a literary phrase. This is an unacceptable
position to take&#8212;morally, literarily, historically, or theologically.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Elder Holland went on to explain: &#8220;If Joseph Smith did not translate the Book of Mormon as a
work of ancient origin, then I would move heaven and earth to meet the &#8216;real&#8217; nineteenth-century
author. After one hundred and fifty years, . . . surely there must be someone willing to step
forward&#8212;if no one else, at least the descendants of the &#8216;real&#8217; author&#8212;claiming credit for such a
remarkable document and all that has transpired in its wake. After all, a writer that can move
millions can make millions. Shouldn&#8217;t someone have come forth then or now to cashier the
whole phenomenon?&#8221; (Holland, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Christ and the New Covenant</span> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book,
1997), 345-47.)  With this in mind, perhaps we can better appreciate why Joseph Smith stated
simply: &#8220;Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We
have none&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline">(History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</span>, 7 vols., ed. B.H. Roberts
(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1957), 2:52).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">While we seek to make friends and build bridges of understanding with persons of other faiths
where possible, we do not court favor, nor do we compromise one whit on what we believe.
Some doctrines, like the doctrine of &#8220;only true and living church&#8221; (D&amp;C 1:30), by their very
nature, arouse antagonism from those of other faiths. Would it not be wise to avoid or at least
downplay such divisive points? Perhaps, some say, we should consider focusing on matters we
have in common and put aside, for the time being, the distinctive teachings of the Restoration.
Elder Boyd K. Packer declared: &#8220;If we thought only in terms of diplomacy or popularity, surely
we should change our course. But we must hold tightly to it even though some turn away. . . . </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#160;&#8220;It is not an easy thing for us to defend the position that bothers so many others. But, brethren
and sisters, never be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Never apologize for the sacred
doctrines of the gospel. Never feel inadequate and unsettled because you cannot explain them to
the satisfaction of all who might inquire of you. Do not be ill at ease or uncomfortable because
you can give little more than your conviction. . . .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;If we can stand without shame, without hesitancy, without embarrassment, without reservation
to bear witness that the gospel has been restored, that there are prophets and Apostles upon the
earth, that the truth is available for all mankind, the Lord&#8217;s Spirit will be with us. And that
assurance can be affirmed to others&#8221; (Conference Report, October 1985,104, 107).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the end, the only way that the things of God can and should be known is by the power of the
Holy Ghost. These things are what the scriptures call the &#8220;mysteries of God.&#8221; Another way of
stating this is to suggest that the only way that spiritual truths may be known is by the quiet
whisperings of the Holy Ghost. How did Alma the younger know? Was it because he was struck
to the ground by an angel? Was it because he lay immobile and speechless for three days while
he underwent a confrontation with himself and his sinful and rebellious past? No, Alma knew as
we know: he may have undergone a serious turnaround in his life through the intervention of a
heavenly messenger, but the witness that drove and directed this magnificent convert was the
witness of the Spirit. In his own words, &#8220;Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these
things whereof I have spoken are true. And how do ye suppose that I know of their surety?
Behold, I say unto you <span style="text-decoration: underline">they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God</span>. Behold, I have
fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now I do know of
myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit;
and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me&#8221; (Alma 5:45-46).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">On the other hand, we can come to sense the <span style="text-decoration: underline">significance</span> of a spiritual reality by the loud
janglings of opposition it engenders. For example, what do the following locations have in
common: Portland, Dallas, Atlanta, White Plains, Nashville, Denver, Stockholm, and Ghana?
Clearly in each of these places the announcement that a Latter-day Saint temple was to be built
there brought opponents and even crazed zealots out of the woodwork. If I did not already know
by the quiet whisperings of the Spirit within me that what goes on within temples is true and is of
eternal import, I just might sense the significance of the temple by the kind of opposition that
seems almost to flow naturally from those who refuse to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Consider another illustration. Why is it that so many people throughout the world write scathing
books, deliver biting addresses, and prepare vicious videos denouncing the Book of Mormon?
What is it about black words on a white page, all of which are uplifting and edifying, that invite
men and women to come unto Christ and be perfected in Him, that would arouse such bitter
antagonism? Once again, if I did not already know, by the quiet whisperings of the Spirit, that the
Book of Mormon is truly heaven-sent and indeed Another Testament of Jesus Christ, I would
recognize its significance&#8212;its power to settle doctrinal disputes, touch hearts, and transform men
and women&#8217;s lives&#8212;by the loud and hostile reactions people tend to have toward it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Hugh Nibley, one of the greatest minds of this dispensation, a defender of the faith throughout
his life, stated: &#8220;The words of the prophets cannot be held to the tentative and defective tests that
men have devised for them. Science, philosophy, and common sense all have a right to their day
in court. But the last word does not lie with them. Every time men in their wisdom have come
forth with the last word, other words have promptly followed. The last word is a testimony of the
gospel that comes only by direct revelation. Our Father in heaven speaks it, and if it were in
perfect agreement with the science of today, it would surely be out of line with the science of
tomorrow. Let us not, therefore, seek to hold God to the learned opinions of the moment when he
speaks the language of eternity&#8221; (<span style="text-decoration: underline">The 
World and the Prophets</span> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book and

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have learned a few things as I have learned a few things over the years. I thank God for the
formal education I have received, for the privilege it is (and I count it such) to have received
university training. Education has expanded my mind and opened conversations and doors for
me. It has taught me what books to read, how to research a topic, and how to make my case or
present my point of view more effectively. But the more I learn, the more I value the truths of
salvation, those simple but profound verities that soothe and settle and sanctify human hearts. I
appreciate knowing that the order of the cosmos points toward a Providential Hand; I am deeply
grateful to know, by the power of the Holy Ghost, that there is a God and that he is our Father in
heaven. I appreciate knowing something about the social, political, and religious world into
which Jesus of Nazareth was born; I am deeply grateful for the witness of the Spirit that he is
indeed God&#8217;s Almighty Son. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I appreciate knowing something about the social and intellectual climate of nineteenth-century
America; I am grateful to have, burning within my soul, a testimony that the Father and the Son
appeared to Joseph Smith in the Spring of 1820, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is truly the kingdom of God on earth. In short, the more I encounter men&#8217;s
approximations to what is, the more I treasure those absolute truths that make known &#8220;things as
they really are, and . . . things as they really will be&#8221; (Jacob 4:13; compare D&amp;C 93:24). In fact,
the more we learn, the more we begin to realize what we do not know, the more we feel the need
to consider ourselves &#8220;fools before God&#8221; (2 Nephi 9:42). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Those who choose to follow the Brethren, believe in and teach the scriptures, and be loyal to the
Church&#8212;no matter the extent of their academic training or intellectual capacity&#8212;open
themselves to ridicule from the cynic and the critic. Ultimately, doctrinal truth comes not through
the explorations of scholars, but through the revelations of God to apostles and prophets. And if
such a position be labeled as narrow, parochial, or anti-intellectual, then so be it. I cast my lot
with the prophets. I am one who sincerely believes that education need not be antithetical to
conversion and commitment; it all depends on where one places his or her trust. &#8220;True religion,&#8221;
Elder Bruce R. McConkie testified, &#8220;deals with spiritual things. We do not come to a knowledge
of God and his laws through intellectuality, or by research, or by reason. . . . In their sphere,
education and intellectuality are devoutly to be desired. But when contrasted with spiritual
endowments, they are of but slight and passing worth. From an eternal perspective what each of
us needs is a Ph.D. in faith and righteousness. The things that will profit us everlastingly are not
the power to reason, but the ability to receive revelation; not the truths learned by study, but the
knowledge gained by faith; not what we know about the things of the world, but our knowledge
of God and his laws&#8221; (Conference Report, April 1971, 99). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I know, as I know that I live, that God lives, that he is our Father in heaven, that he has a body of
flesh and bones, and that we are created in his image. I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of the
living God and that he was crucified for the sins of the world. I know that through genuine, godly
sorrow for sin, we can have our garments washed in the blood of the Lamb and enjoy peace and
happiness here and eternal glory hereafter. I know that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of
God, a covenant spokesman for Deity, the preeminent prophetic revealer of Christ and the plan of
salvation, the one called to stand as the head of this final gospel dispensation; through his
instrumentality, precious doctrinal truths and divine, saving authority have been restored to the
earth. Further, my witness is current. I know that Gordon B. Hinckley stands in the shoes of
Brother Joseph, that he holds the keys of the kingdom of God in their fulness, and that it is our
privilege to live at a time when prophets and apostles walk the earth. This Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints is in the line of its duty, and it is preparing a people for the second coming of
the Son of Man. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">These things I know. I have come to know them by the same means and in the same manner that
Peter knew that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16-17). My
knowledge of things spiritual, like all true faith, is based on evidence that is not seen. I chose to
<span style="text-decoration: underline">believe</span>, and in the process I came to <span style="text-decoration: underline">see</span>, to know. At the same time, I possess what the apostle
Peter called a reason for the hope that is in us (1 Peter 3:15). That is to say, my witness is as
satisfying and stimulating to my mind as it is settling and soothing to my heart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">God grant that you and I, as a peculiar or a purchased people, may cleave unto Him who is the
Truth; that our total trust, our complete confidence, and our ready reliance will always be in Him;
that our lives will reflect more and more what we know and believe; and that we will &#8220;shew forth
the praises of him who hath called [us] out of darkness into his marvelous light&#8221; (1 Peter 2:9). </span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have taken the title of this lecture, &#8220;The Established Order of the Kingdom of God,&#8221; from a
statement by the Prophet Joseph Smith as he was discussing the purpose of the ministration of
angels and spirits to men and women on the earth.  His explanation was that heavenly
messengers converse with mortals to teach them <i>&#8220;the established order of the kingdom of
God,&#8221;</i> and to bring those mortals <i>&#8220;up to the standard of their knowledge&#8221;</i> (TPJS, pp. 320,
325).  I take it that the <i>&#8220;established order&#8221;</i> is that which already exists in heaven.  By their
ministering, the angels and spirits raise the cultural, spiritual, and intellectual level of the
mortals to a higher plane, so that the order in heaven will become the order on earth.</span></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size:12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Completeness of the Eternal Plan</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">This idea also gives me a feeling for the exactness and completeness of the plan of salvation
and the ancient and eternal nature of the plan and why it is called a new and everlasting
covenant.  The plan is eternal, and thus is very old and everlasting, but each one of us learns it
individually - thus to us it is &#8220;new.&#8221;  The plan of salvation, with all its promises and blessings
is not only what our Heavenly Father wants us to live by; it is the plan and system that He and
other celestial persons live by.  That gives particular meaning to the scripture in which the
Lord says:  &#8220;Be ye holy, for I am holy&#8221; (1 Peter 1:15-16; Leviticus 11:45; 19:2; 20:26).  If we
are to be comfortable in God&#8217;s presence, then we must be as much like Him as possible.  The
revealed plan of redemption that we have in the Church, and which is spoken of in the
scriptures, reflects the type of life and environment of the celestial kingdom.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size:12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Exaltation is by Redemption</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">What our Heavenly Father is doing is infusing into our mortal, fallen environment, as rapidly
as we can absorb it, the kind of life that He has.  He has revealed the authority of the holy
priesthood, and the laws and ordinances, and family organization that exists in heaven.  He
does not force it upon us, but as we taste of the joy, the testimony, and the knowledge of the
gospel, and of the Holy Spirit, we want more.  It is natural to thirst for more knowledge.  It is
such a huge transition and change from our mortal condition into celestial light and glory, and
holiness, that it takes time and effort.  Such a change cannot be made casually or by osmosis
alone.  It is not accomplished by intellectuality or by education alone.  The change can only
come through the atonement of Jesus Christ, and by our faith and repentance, and obedience
to the ordinances and a mighty change of heart brought about by the action of the Holy Ghost
upon us.  Exaltation in the presence of God is redemptive, spiritual, intellectual, and physical. 
The Gospel of Jesus Christ, with all its blessings, is the only way that a person can be
prepared to return home and stand comfortably in the presence of God.</span></font></p>

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">The plan of salvation, with all of its ordinances, commandments and priesthood authority, is
actually a piece of celestial society (a divine pattern) transferred to and superimposed upon
our mortal condition.  I pray for the help of the Holy Spirit so that I can present a few
passages of scripture and teachings of the Brethren in an interesting and useful manner.  Have
you noticed that when the Lord calls a great prophet or seer, he generally gives him a vision
of the universe and of eternity, to orient him so that he will know what is out there, and what
is in heaven, so he can teach with conviction and authority?  Adam, Enoch, the Brother of
Jared, Abraham, Moses, Peter, Paul, Nephi and Joseph Smith all had this orientation, as did
many others.  We receive an orientation, on a smaller scale, in the endowment of the temple. 
A temple is a scale model of the universe.  It shows us what God&#8217;s plans are.  In the temple
endowment we receive some secrets of the universe.</span></font></p>

doctrines, ordinances and covenants upon men and women, establish a colony, so to speak.  It
is like settlers coming from the old world of Europe to North America, and they brought their
customs, ideas and lifestyle with them.  Thus we have New York, New Jersey, New
Hampshire, New England and New Holland, and in the South Pacific, New Zealand and New
South Wales, New Guinea, etc.  We see the same with San Francisco&#8217;s Chinatown, and many
other like places.  The Lord began a &#8220;colony&#8221; from heaven when he came to Joseph Smith in
the Sacred Grove, and later sent Moroni, John the Baptist, Peter, Moses, Elijah and other
heavenly representatives to establish the dispensation of the fullness of times.  In reality a
little stone was cut out of the mountain, without human hands (Daniel 2:45), that will
eventually roll forth and fill the whole earth, as spoken of in Doctrine and Covenants 65:1-2:</span></font></p>

ever be done on earth without revealing the secret to his servants the prophets&#8221;</i> (Times and
Seasons<i>,</i>1 September 1842, p. 905).  The Prophet says that God will do nothing but what he
will reveal unto his servants the prophets.  Consequently, if it is not made known to the
prophets, it will not come to pass (6 April 1843, <i>Words of Joseph Smith, </i>p. 181).</span></font></p>

<font color="#000080">These are wonderful and important principles.  Everything in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, from
premortal life, to earth life, to post-mortal life, to resurrection and eternal judgment, is one
package, each segment is based and built upon the same format and the same goals, and the
same plan, and the same purposes as every other segment.  I talked with a man who had
served a mission in Australia 70 years ago.  He told me that to cross the continent of Australia
by rail in those days, it took three different railroad companies, and each one had a different
width track.  One company&#8217;s train could not run on another company&#8217;s track.  You would ride
one train as far as it went, then change to the other company, and so forth.  No unity, no
continuity.  Now compare that with the plan of salvation that God has for the human family. 
One plan comprehends the entire trip from newborn spirit child to exaltation.  One plan fits
all places, all persons, all conditions.  It is correlated, unified, divine, and is the plan of God
our Father, made available to us through the atonement of Jesus Christ, and is adapted to the
personal needs of every person, through the love, mercy, and grace of God.  It is the new and

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">When we find in the scriptures, and in the teachings of the prophets, such phrases and terms
as &#8220;<i>the holy order of God,</i>&#8221; and &#8221;<i>new and everlasting covenant,</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>before the foundation

from God to us because we are his children and he wants to save us and bring us up to his
standard.  I know it is popular to say that everything is relative and evolutionary.  I know that
some things are relative, but fundamental gospel truths are absolute.  The scripture says in
Doctrine and Covenants 121:42 that the faithful will receive <i>&#8220;pure knowledge.&#8221;</i>  I suppose
&#8220;pure knowledge&#8221; is absolute truth received by revelation as compared to knowledge by
human research which might be relative and change with more research.  I heard a student
declare with great finality that there are no absolute truths, and that everything was relative. 
If that were so, then his own statement could not be true, because he was making an absolute
statement.  Be assured, brothers and sisters, that there <span style="font-weight: bold">are</span> absolute truths, and they come from
God, and they are essential to our eternal welfare.  There is comfort and assurance in knowing
that salvation operates on the basis of truth as it really is.  The great plan which God has
revealed for us to follow is absolute, and is the same plan that He, himself, followed millions
of years ago (See Wilford Woodruff, <i>JD</i> 4:192-3) that enabled Him to become who He is.

enthroned in yonder heavens!  That is the great secret.  If the veil were rent

you were to see him today, you would see him like a man in form&#8212;like
yourselves in all the person, image, and very form as a man; for Adam was
created in the very fashion, image and likeness of God, and received
instruction from, and walked, talked and conversed with him, as one man
talks and communes with another&#8230;.It is necessary we should understand the
character and being of God and how he came to be so; for I am going to tell
you how God came to be God.  We have imagined and supposed that God was
God from all eternity.  I will refute that idea, and take away the veil, so that
you may see.  These are incomprehensible ideas to some, but they are simple.</i>
<span style="font-weight: bold">It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character
of God, and to know that we may converse with him as one man
converses with another, and that he was once a man like us; yea, that God
himself, the Father of us all, dwelt on an earth, the same as Jesus Christ
himself did</span><i>; &#8230;The Scriptures inform us that Jesus said, As the Father hath
power in Himself, even so hath the Son power&#8212;to do what?  Why, what the
Father did.  The answer is obvious&#8212;in a manner to lay down His body and
take it up again.  Jesus, what are you going to do?  To lay down my life as my
Father did, and take it up again&#8230;.Here, then, is eternal life&#8212;to know the only
wise and true God; and you have got to learn how to be Gods yourselves, and
to be kings and priests to God, the same as all Gods have done before you,
namely, by going from one small degree to another, and from a small capacity
to a great one; from grace to grace, from exaltation to exaltation, until you
attain to the resurrection of the dead, and are able to dwell in everlasting

that it is basic doctrine of the Gospel of Jesus Christ that marriage, as performed in the
temple, is necessary to obtain a fullness of God&#8217;s glory.  The conclusion is unmistakable. 
What we have in the Church is the <i>pattern</i> of the celestial family&#8212;to enable us to become

<font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Time will not permit a discussion of the many other principles that were taught by the Prophet
Joseph Smith that give us a glimpse of the order of eternity.  I will quickly mention a few. 
The Prophet Joseph explained that every person may receive revelation from the Lord for his
or her own guidance, and for his or her particular responsibilities, but it is contrary to the
order of heaven for anyone to receive revelation for those in higher authority than themselves
(<i>TPJS,</i> p. 111; D&amp;C 28:1-7).</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">The Prophet Joseph also gave numerous insights concerning the different ministrations of
angels and spirits, and that Adam, as the oldest man, and patriarch of the human family
presides over the spirits of all mankind.  He taught that angels and spirits are those who once
lived on this earth as mortals, and that when any angel or spirit ministers to men or women on
this earth, it is by Adam&#8217;s authority (<i>TPJS</i>, pp. 157, 167-69).  Thus it was Adam who sent
Moroni, John the Baptist, Peter, James, John, Moses, Elijah, etc. to Joseph Smith.  Joseph also
taught that no angels or spirits minister to this earth except those who do or have belonged to
this earth, and that angels have advanced further than spirits because they have bodies of flesh
and bone (Doctrine and Covenants 130:5; 129:1-9).  If priesthood or keys are to be conferred
it requires an angel with a tangible body.  If the purpose is knowledge, a spirit can do that.</span></font></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt">&#160;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When I was a senior in high school, I had a good friend who was an active member of another
church. We talked about religion quite a bit. She had a minister whom she wanted me to meet,
thinking that he would be helpful in our discussion. We agreed that I would go to church with her
and meet with her minister afterwards and she would do the same with me, meeting with my bishop
afterwards.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I remember only one incident from the day I went with her to her church. We were having a
discussion in the minister&#8217;s office after the services about his church and my church. I don&#8217;t know
what prompted my question, but I know it was sincere and not meant to be accusatory. I asked,
&#8220;Well, then, how do you explain the Book of Mormon?&#8221; I asked it feeling sure that he would have
a valid and well-thought out answer. Instead, I was caught off guard with the instant fury of his response. He almost shouted at me, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t <i>have</i> to explain the Book of Mormon. I don&#8217;t even have to think about it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Well, I had and still have a low ability to tolerate open conflict. I simply can&#8217;t stand to have people
yell at me. So I quickly changed the subject and somehow the interview ended amicably. However,
I have never forgotten his words. I have thought of them often in terms of myself. Perhaps that
minister didn&#8217;t feel impelled to consider the Book of Mormon, but I did and do. I believe that once
honest, god-fearing people come into contact with this sacred record, we do have a mandate to
consider it&#8212;to read it and allow ourselves to personally and honestly respond to it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Faust described his mother&#8217;s copy of the Book of Mormon. He said it was <i>&#8220;timeworn&#8221;</i> and
<i>&#8220;dog-eared,&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;almost every page was marked.&#8221;</i> As I read that description I immediately thought
of my husband&#8217;s copy of the Book of Mormon. This book is concrete evidence that over many years
he has <i>&#8220;read it, studied it, prayed over it, and taught from it&#8230;No one [has] to tell [him] that [he]
could get closer to God by reading the Book of Mormon than by any other book.&#8221;</i> How could you
not love a man who every single morning during our 38+ years of marriage has begun his day by
studying and pondering the words of this book. I am very sure, because of the way he lives that he
would explain the Book of Mormon by saying it is from God and provides a beacon and a map to
navigate successfully the ups and downs of life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Our individual explanation of the Book of Mormon, in other words, our personal knowledge of its
divinity is absolutely critical to everything else about our religious beliefs. In fact, one could say that
everything succeeds or fails in light of this one critical item. I have a friend who explained to me that
in the business world, there is a term called &#8220;single point failure.&#8221; A single point failure is used to
describe an item that, if failed, would cause the failure of the entire system. Obviously, in business
there is an extreme reluctance to establish such an item. We try in every way possible to decrease
the risk of one item having such a potential. In contrast, we try to spread the risk. For instance, if we
deal in commodities, we would never want one commodity to be so powerful, that if it were
weakened, the whole package would fail, and so forth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In contrast, in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints we consider the The Book of Mormon
a single point failure item. In other words, if the Book of Mormon is a hoax, dreamed up and written
from the imagination of a New England farm boy, then the rest of the church is invalid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley said,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>â¦if the

Redeemer, the Savior of the worldâ¦If the Book of Mormon is true, then this land 
is choice above all other landsâ¦If the Book of Mormon is true, Joseph Smith was 
a prophet of Godâ¦I repeat, if the Book of Mormon is true, the Church is true â¦</i>(Teachings of GBH, pp. 40-41).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When you consider such a vulnerable position, I believe it places a mandate on each of us to dig
deeply into this sacred record. I don&#8217;t believe any of us in this room have the right to say that we
don&#8217;t have to explain the Book of Mormon, or that we don&#8217;t even have to think about it. Because we
have been exposed to it and it is so important to the validity of this church, we each must come to
a personal explanation of it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">And of course, we must come to an explanation that, in the words of President Hinckley,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>[it] is more than literary analysis or scientific research, although these are
reassuring and most welcome. The truth will be determined today and tomorrow, as
it has been through the yesterdays, by the reading of it in a spirit of reverence and
respect and prayer&#8230;</i>(ibid, p. 38).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My personal explanation of the Book of Mormon is one of testimony. I believe with all of my heart
and mind that it is a sacred record, one authored by prophets through the ages, meant<i> &#8220;to establish
and tie together eternal principles and precepts, rounding out basic doctrines of salvation&#8221;</i> (Ensign,
Jan 2004, Faust, p. 3) that are only partially explained in other books of scripture.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In a very personal way, beyond the establishment of doctrine, I have come to love and rely on the
Book of Mormon to understand how real people live&#8212;their relationships to one another and to God.
In no other book of scripture do we have so much information about individuals, their families, their
history over time, and the cause and effect relationship of righteous and unrighteous decisions. We
see them under circumstances of war, fatigue, triumph and desperate need. This is &#8220;stuff&#8221; I want to
understand! And so I read it over and over, pouring over verses that bring new insights with each
reading.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Because I have come to love so many of the people of the Book of Mormon and because the
messages of their lives have so much power in my own, I would like to talk with you this morning
about three of my Book of Mormon friends and give you just a nibble of the abundant menu they
offer in terms of life truths. I have chosen three men. Nephi, the first hero of the Book of Mormon;
Moroni, the last; and Alma the Younger, smack-dab in the middle!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Nephi. What a man! Who of us doesn&#8217;t love his straightforward beginning:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all
the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days,
nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had
a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a
record of my proceedings in my days</i> (1 Nephi 1:1).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There are many habitual responses to the challenges of life that are noteworthy with Nephi. I will
identify only one, hoping that you will never forget it, because I believe it makes us so powerful
personally. Nephi&#8217;s lifelong pattern first reveals itself in the 2nd chapter of Nephi. Nephi indicates
that his father has had vision. Lehi&#8217;s vision is described by Nephi, and the subsequent exodus from
Jerusalem. Then Nephi indicates that Laman and Lemuel&#8230; <i>&#8220;did murmur against their father. And
they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi
1:12).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Let&#8217;s examine Nephi&#8217;s reaction to his father&#8217;s vision. Nephi was young and inexperienced and so
he must also have been in some ignorance of the doings of God and had some questions about his
father&#8217;s vision. But, rather than sitting around discussing the vision with his brothers and being
obstructionary, he does something that is quite remarkable, but quite simple: <span style="font-weight: bold">He goes to the Lord
himself</span>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>I, Nephi,&#8230;having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry
unto the Lord; and behold he did visit, me, and did soften my heart that I did believe
all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against
him like unto my brothers</i> (Nephi 2:16).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">There is so much information in that verse. Nephi went to the Lord because he desired to know the
mysteries of God. I am told that the word &#8220;mysteries&#8221; comes from the Greek &#8220;mysterium&#8221;, which
means things that can only be understood through the spirit. So Nephi desired to understand spiritual
things&#8212;he wanted spiritual information concerning Lehi&#8217;s dream.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Not Laman and Lemuel. They too were concerned about their father&#8217;s dream, but they had no desire
to understand it. They seemed to be completely focused on their own disrupted lives&#8212;leaving
Jerusalem, their land, their gold and silver and their precious things and risking their very lives in
the wilderness. Their desires were centered on their own needs. Actually, that doesn&#8217;t seem too
unusual. Who wouldn&#8217;t have realized what leaving Jerusalem would mean? They finally did as they
were told, but only because they &#8220;durst not&#8221; utter against Lehi when he spoke with a terrifying power
that shook their frames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">And so, one message that I hear over and over again from the life of Nephi is simply: <span style="font-weight: bold">Go to the
Lord yourself. Find out for yourself, not from other people and your own figuring out, but
from the Source.  </span>I hear it when he seeks to retrieve the plates from Laban. Rather than focusing
on all of the difficulties, Nephi, our hero, focuses on hearing and <i>&#8220;obey[ing] the voice of the Spirit&#8221;</i>
(1 Nephi 4:18).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Go to the Lord yourself</span>. I hear that message when Nephi <i>&#8220;arose up and went up into the mountain,
and cried unto the Lord&#8221; </i>(1Nephi 17:7) and then obediently went about building a ship. In contrast,
his brothers took counsel with one another, failing to see beyond their own limited understanding,
because they did not even desire to <span style="font-weight: bold">find out for themselves</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Translation 2lst Century: A woman told me that she heard President Hinckley&#8217;s forceful General
Conference message concerning debt. This woman lives prudently but owed some money at fairly
low interest rates for a particular property. It would have been a fairly simple matter to discuss this
loan with a friend and determine that it wasn&#8217;t really the kind of debt Pres. Hinckley was counseling
against. Rather, she gave a Nephi response. She determined to go to the Lord herself. The impression
was clear that she should cash in some other assets and pay off the debt. She did it. Not out of fear,
or because she durst not, but because responding to the Lord was a peace-bringing and satisfying
labor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Last Monday night my husband read aloud a talk given by one of the brethren. I must admit that in
my mind I began to carry on a Laman and Lemuel conversation&#8212;questioning some of the
conclusions with my limited vision. When I had done some of that my husband quietly said that he
really didn&#8217;t believe one of the brethren would be wrong in his assessment of the situation. I felt
somewhat ashamed, but it wasn&#8217;t until the next morning that I was willing to <span style="font-weight: bold">Go to the Lord
myself</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">And guess what? I understood what was meant, spiritually. My little opinion was off just a bit. Not
only did I understand the truth of the matter, but I lost those negative argumentative feelings. In
hindsight, it seems like a no-brainer that we would all like to live like Nephi rather than be miserable
like Laman and Lemuel, but in my experience it somehow seems ever-so-important for us to hold
onto our little assessment of things and not want to admit that we could be wrong. Small comfort,
holding out against the Lord and his spiritual confirmations. Quite pitiful. Really, who wants to feel
that they are RIGHT when the tradeoff is living with the vision and happiness that the Spirit
provides! Go to the Lord yourself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now to Alma the Younger. Elder Holland said,</span></p>

midpoint of the record&#8212;five hundred years after Lehi leaves Jerusalem, five hundred
years before Moroni seals ups the record </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Book of Mormon: It Begins with a

Savior, we can become new creatures. We can be born again. He tells and retells the story of his

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now this may not seem like such a big deal when you are twenty. But, trust me, as you grow older
and older and fail again and again at resolutions to do this or <i>not</i> do that, you will long to not just
do things differently, but to actually <i>be </i>different. Self-discipline, personal goals, resolutions, and
keeping covenants are vital, but the real miracle of change comes through the Savior.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Elder Oaks said,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>The greatest miracle is not in such things as restoring sight to the blind, healing an
illness, or even raising the dead, since all of these restorations will happen, in any
event, in the Resurrection.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Changing bodies is miraculous, &#8230;but an even greater miracle is a might change of
heart by a son or daughter of God (see Mosiah 5:2). A change of heart, including
new attitudes, priorities, and desires, is greater and more important than any miracle
involving the body&#8230;A change affecting what the scripture calls the &#8216;heart&#8217; of a spirit
son or daughter of God is a change whose effect is eternal. If of the right kind, this
change opens the door to the process of repentance that cleanses us to dwell in the
presence of God. It introduces the perspective and priorities that lead us to make the
choices that qualify us for eternal life, &#8216;the greatest of all the gifts of God&#8217;</i> (Doctrine
and Covenants 14:7).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Ezra Taft Benson taught, <i>&#8220;When you choose to follow Christ, you choose to be changed.&#8221;</i>
I love that idea. I think it&#8217;s true.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The change is far deeper than anything we would probably put on a New Year&#8217;s Resolution list,
although some of the things on our list might move will move us toward a spiritual rebirth, when
those resolutions involve keeping commandments and covenants (Mosiah 5:5).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It&#8217;s always hard to know if we are making progress in our desires to become new creatures. Elder
Oaks addressed that issue. He taught us that we could be encouraged <i>&#8220;if we are losing our desire
to do evil,&#8221; </i>and want to do good continually. We will also be making progress if we are <i>&#8220;beginning
to see things as our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, see them&#8221;</i> (DHO, Ensign, Nov
2000, p. 32). Isn&#8217;t that something worth praying, repenting and pleading for? Wouldn&#8217;t you feel very
good if you saw situations and other people like Our Heavenly Father and the Savior see them? And
wanting to do good continually? No wonder Alma, the Younger&#8217;s message speaks to my heart:
<span style="font-weight: bold">Change is possible. It comes through the atonement of Jesus Christ.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now to my last hero: Moroni. Moroni was born into two worlds: one of decadence, in which the
people were without principle, and &#8220;past feeling&#8221; and another of faith in which parental
righteousness ensured continued exposure to the gifts of the spirit. Moroni grew up at the frontier
of decision between these two worlds. Bound to his father by a warm affection and by their mutual
concern for the kingdom, he would devote 2/3 of his own book of scripture to a presentation of his
father&#8217;s teaching and letters. It is impossible to talk about Moroni without his father, Mormon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">They stood together on Cumorah, two of only 24 survivors, looking down on blood and carnage&#8212;the
bodies of about a quarter of a million of their brothers and sisters. Moroni would eventually endure
loneliness virtually unparalleled in chronicled history. By the time of his first entry on the plates,
Moroni had already wandered alone for some 16 years, and another twenty years were still to pass
before he finally sealed up the records. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">One of the great messages of Moroni has to be that <span style="font-weight: bold">One plus God is sufficient. </span>How could he
survive for so long without kin or friends? He was ministered to by the Nephite disciples, who did
<i>&#8220;tarry in the land</i>&#8221; (Mormon 8:10).<span style="font-weight: bold"> </span>He gloried in the majesty of God:<i> &#8220;Behold, are not the things
that God hath wrought marvelous in our eyes?&#8221;</i> (Mormon 9:16) He took comfort in his testimony
of the power of God: <i>&#8220;If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is
expedient in meâ</i> (Moroni 7:33).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">One plus God is sufficient. </span>I&#8217;ve felt alone and misunderstood before, and I&#8217;m sure you have too,
but although he mentions his terrible aloneness, Moroni doesn&#8217;t dwell on it. Rather, he looks beyond
himself to his brethren and to the Lamanite people. When he can no longer focus on teaching and
helping them he turns his attention to future generations, to us. He writes, teaches, exhorts,
persuades, pleads. We can take inspiration from Moroni. <span style="font-weight: bold">One plus God is sufficient</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">Think</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">Big,
beyond yourself.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I went to a bridal shower recently where the mother of the bride gave good advice to the young
couple. She warned them not to lead &#8220;small lives.&#8221; I believe she was recognizing the dangers of
keeping our lives centered on ourselves and our little daily problems. Think about that when you&#8217;re
feeling down, think about the people around you, those who have gone before, those who will come
after, the kingdom of God&#8212;here and beyond. <span style="font-weight: bold">Think big</span>, like Moroni.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I love the last paragraph of the 1st Presidency Proclamation written in 1907.</span></p>

beings, for whose salvation it is our mission to labor; and to this work, broad as
eternity and deep as the love of God, we devote ourselves, now and forever.</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I love the Book of Mormon. The people in it are real. They are replete with messages for us. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">

comes through the atonement of Jesus Christ.&#8221; </span>And Moroni whispers steadily<span style="font-weight: bold">, &#8220;One plus God
is sufficient; think big, think beyond your small self.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The furious response of my friend&#8217;s minister many years ago leads me to believe that he indeed felt
some compunction to investigate the Book of Mormon and was fighting against it. What he felt or
didn&#8217;t feel, however, is not mine to say, but I would like to invite each of us to continue to consider
the Book of Mormon. We can read it, pray about it, think about it, put its principles into our lives,
see if they work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Saints were in serious trouble in Far West, Missouri in 1838.  The mob violence, instigated
in part by the state government, had reached a fever pitch.  The first of November found the
Prophet Joseph, his brother, Hyrum, and others under arrest and sentenced to be executed. 
Brigadier General Alexander W. Doniphan had been ordered by his superior officer, Major
General Samuel D. Lucas to execute the prisoners the following morning in the town square. 
General Doniphan responded:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>It is cold-blooded murder. I will not obey your order. My brigade shall march for Liberty tomorrow morning, at 8 o'clock; and if you execute these men, I will hold you responsible before an earthly tribunal, so help me God.</i></span>
<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">After reading the response of General Doniphan, General Lucas thought better of his order and
took the prisoners to Richmond, Missouri and later to the infamous Liberty Jail where they were
confined.  Why is it that the prophets and the Saints of God seem to be required to offer sacrifice
here in mortality?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We often sing the words, &#8220;Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven.&#8221;  What kind of
sacrifice?  What kind of blessings?  To set the stage for consideration of these questions, let me
tell you about a remarkable man and his life of sacrifice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Just over a week after the prisoners were arrested, Joseph F. Smith, son of Hyrum and Mary
Fielding Smith was born.  When he was about three months old, his mother struggled to escape
Missouri because of the extermination order of Governor Boggs.  Besides her three-month old
baby, she took with her five other children who had been born to Hyrum and his wife, Jerusha,
who had died.  She eventually reached Nauvoo, Illinois.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Mary's trials can hardly be imagined without having experienced her sacrifices.  Hyrum, who of
course was in prison, said:  <i>&#8220;Our enemies carried off nearly everything of value, until my family
were left destitute.&#8221;</i></span> <sup>2</sup>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Mary might well have said, as did Abigail Adams during the establishment
of this nation: <i>&#8220;Posterity who are to reap the blessings will scarcely be able to conceive the
hardships and sufferings of their ancestors.&#8221;</i></span><sup>3</sup></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">About five months later the brethren imprisoned in the Liberty Jail escaped and made their way
to Nauvoo, their families, and the body of the Church.  For the next five years, Joseph F. Smith
and his parents enjoyed a period of relative peace.  During this time, Mary Fielding Smith wrote
the following to her brother who was living in England.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Joseph F. Smith was younger than six years old when word came that his father, Hyrum, and his
uncle, the Prophet Joseph, had been martyred in Carthage Jail.  Age nine saw him crossing the
plains filling the assignment of an adult teamster driving an ox team for his widowed mother. 
Two months short of his fourteenth birthday, his beloved mother, Mary Fielding Smith, passed
away.  When he was fifteen years old, President Brigham Young called him to serve a mission to
the Hawaiian Islands.  That mission lasted four years, and his service left an indelible impression
on the people there.  The Hawaiian Saints still remember him and hold his name in reverence
and honor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In time he was called to be a General Authority where he served for fifty-two years.  Seventeen
of those years he presided over the Church.  Let us look in on him at age eighty.  He has worn
out his life in sacrifice to the Lord and for His fellow men.  He is the President and prophet of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  The Lord will, in seven weeks, release him from
mortality and call him home to service on the other side of the veil.  Now his own words: </span></p>

keep the covenants we have made with the Lord.  What is expected of us because we have made

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Let me give you two examples of a fulfillment of this promise.  One day while serving as the
Executive Director of the Missionary Department, I received a phone call pertaining to a man
who had received a call to serve as a mission president accompanied, of course, by his wife.  His
business partners, who could not understand the willingness of this man and his wife to leave
their business, offered the church $100,000 if the call would be rescinded.  I knew, of course, the
answer but took it, nevertheless, to the member of the Quorum of the Twelve who was serving as
the Chairman of the Missionary Executive Committee.  His response was predictable.  &#8220;Tell
them we need the brother, his wife, and would appreciate the $100,000 as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">How much pressure do you think his partners applied on him before the money was offered to
the Church?   What risk was he taking after investing so much of his life in the business world? 
How difficult might it be when they returned to the business after their mission?  Would there be
anything there?  I have watched that couple carefully since that day and can testify to you that
the impact of their devotion and sacrifice has righteously influenced a multitude of people. 
Their sacrifices during and after that mission have <i>&#8220;yielded much precious fruit.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Another example:  One&#8217;s life can be swallowed up in the will of the Father at any time. One need
not be middle aged.  Sometimes the sacrifice is keener when one is young.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">While presiding in the mission field I interviewed a missionary who was somewhat shy and very
homesick.  He had been in the mission field for less than two months.  I asked how things were
going, and he began to weep.  He said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the people here, I don&#8217;t like the heat and the
humidity, and most of all, I don&#8217;t like my companion or his cooking.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I said, &#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He looked up at me through tears and with surprise, and responded, &#8220;I am going to complete this
mission.  I have been called by a prophet of God, and I will serve, but I don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;  The will
of the son swallowed up in the will of the Father.  I am certain that he did not think that he had
made a life-changing decision during those days of difficulty.   Time will pass and eternity will
unfold before the blessings of that decision are fully received.  Twenty-two months later, a
powerful teacher of righteousness returned to his home and, I am sure, to a lifetime of service. 
He kept his covenants by sacrifice, and, as a result, the Lord blessed him with <i>&#8220;much precious
fruit.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It would be well for us to remember that the Lord does not talk about a law of convenience.  So
many of us are willing to observe our covenants if it is convenient.  The sacrifice that brings joy
in mortality and exaltation in eternity requires a surrendering of our will to the Father and
obedience to the covenants we have made with Him.   President Hinckley has said <i>&#8220;it is only a
sacrifice if you give more than you receive.&#8221; </i>  By that definition most who serve the Lord
faithfully will say that they have received more than they ever sacrificed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Have we fallen prey to the idea that keeping our covenants and offering sacrifice in the process
is too often inconvenient and, therefore, much too difficult?  Do we rationalize by thinking that
surely the Lord would not expect that much of us?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Brigham Young spoke on this subject a few years after the Saints arrived in the West.</span></p>

your brains reel, and your bodies tremble, and you are ready to exclaim, &#8216;I could

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I can testify that there is unbounded joy in sacrificing for the Kingdom of God on earth.  Let us

have felt&#8212;the unbounded joy that comes as a result of pure sacrifice.</span></p>

Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world and your personal Redeemer.  It is my joy to stand as a

my heart. I am ever thankful for the unstinting support of my dear wife that has enabled and
permitted us to receive church callings that have provided us so many happy and exciting
opportunities as we have served the Lord throughout the world. I quote from the letter I received
from The First Presidency when I was released as a General Authority -<i> &#8220;We especially express
gratitude to Sister Allred who has stood by your side and whose generous support and personal
testimony have made this unique opportunity of service possible.&#8221;</i>  The thoughts of spending

announcement of the Rexburg Idaho Temple.  What a marvelous blessing this temple will bring
to this university, the community, and the saints living within the new temple district. I am
confident that there is much jubilation on the other side of the veil, as there is among us mortal
beings. It is a time of rejoicing, preparation, and goal setting.  The blessings of the temple are
essential to obtaining immortality and eternal lives for yourselves, your families and your kindred
dead (Doctrine and Covenants 131:1-4). It is my prayer that you will always have a current
temple recommend, and that regular temple activity will be a blessing of which you and your

<font color="#000080">-Your mission or purpose in life</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080">-Your potential<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">and will validate your present course of direction.  Answering these questions will enable you to
evaluate your present direction and to help you establish and verify a true course. It will indicate
to you if a change of direction is required in order for you to return back to the presence of your
Heavenly Father.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let me share a personal experience with you. For many years as a career officer in the United
States Air Force, I was assigned to the Aerospace Defense Command. I was responsible for the
maintenance of avionics and fire control systems installed on the fighter interceptor aircraft that
formed the first line of air defense of the Continental United States of America. These aircraft
were man&#8217;s supreme creation in aerospace defense equipment; they were the state-of-the-art, and
their associated electronics systems, munitions and support equipment were on the cutting-edge
of aviation technology. It was our mission to be ready and to defend the United States against any
enemy airborne threat at a moment&#8217;s notice. We were capable of launching an armed aircraft
within five minutes of notification of a sighted intruder.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Cost of research and development of these awesome, magnificent machines of war and the
training of their aircrews was inconsequential. The capability and potential of these machines of
defense and their associated electronic systems and armament were truly spectacular. The most
advanced types of these aircraft were capable of flying in excess of twice the speed of sound, and
of reaching altitudes that perhaps are still classified. They were designed to successfully
intercept, engage, and destroy any known enemy airborne threat.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">On one occasion, during a test flight of one of our fighter interceptors, the aircraft experienced a
compass system failure. The aircrew could not find the target, and the mission was aborted. This
particular airplane had just complete an extensive airframe/engine inspection, and an electronics
modification update, and had been declared combat ready. The defective compass system was
ground checked by expertly-trained, well-qualified navigational aids technicians. The
malfunction could not be duplicated, and the aircraft was flown again. It returned with the same
discrepancy. In total, the aircraft was flown three times. Each time the mission was aborted and
the aircraft returned with the same compass malfunction. During each subsequent post flight, no
compass discrepancies were found; nevertheless, after each aborted test flight, the compass
components, indicators and associated wiring were replaced with new units.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">More by accident than skill, I discovered that six ferrous screws that, out of approximately one
hundred non-ferrous aluminum screws required to secure the compass receiver access panel in
the tail of the aircraft, had inadvertently been installed. The aluminum screws are of a non-ferrous material, which means they were not affected by the magnetic field of the earth, and
would not interfere with a true signal being received by the compass magnetic receiver; while the
screws of a ferrous (iron) material influenced the magnetic field resulting in a distorted signal,
causing the compass to malfunction and give improper and false headings. These few overlooked
ferrous screws had erroneously been installed when the aircraft was in extensive maintenance,
prior to the first test flight, and were responsible for each of the three aborted flights. The
compass system had been ground-checked "OK" prior to, and after each flight because the
compass maintenance access panel had been removed when the system was inspected, and the
magnetic interference of the ferrous screws was not present during operational testing and
checkout of the compass system.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is interesting to note that these six seemingly insignificant screws of the wrong type, with a
value of less than one dollar, were sufficient to thwart the successful completion of the mission
of this magnificent, multi-million dollar, state-of-the-art instrument of national defense, and
nullify the efforts of its trained, skilled, and dedicated aircrew and ground technicians. At the
time of its development and use, this fighter interceptor aircraft was man&#8217;s supreme creation as a
defensive aerospace weapon; however, even with its awesome capabilities and magnificent
power, its potential was nullified by a seemingly small and insignificant means, due to man&#8217;s
lack of attention to details in following established maintenance procedures and practices. Let us
now perform your compass check and address the validity of your spiritual and moral compass
by defining:</font></p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">What is your potential?</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You, as child of a Heavenly Father, through the Atonement of Christ, and by obedience to the
laws and ordinances of the gospel, have the potential of returning to God&#8217;s presence and being
the recipient of all that the Father has (Article of Faith 3). You are the beneficiary of all The
Father&#8217;s love, creations, wisdom, power and knowledge, and are the object of His work and His
glory (Doctrine and Covenants 59:18). It is humbling to know that all that The Father has done,
all that He does now do, and all that He will ever do, is to bring to pass your immortality and
eternal life. (Moses 1:39). I feel as Nephi when he said: <i>&#8220;I know that He (God) loveth his
children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi11:17).<br />
</font></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><font color="#000080">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">Your present course of direction</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080">
		When you were baptized and confirmed a member of the Kingdom of God on Earth (The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) you were given God&#8217;s greatest gift He can give His children
in mortality - the Gift of the Holy Ghost. You have been given a true compass, the Holy Ghost,
which, if followed, will lead, guide and direct you back into the Father&#8217;s presence, and the
promised blessings of eternal lives, God&#8217;s life (2 Nephi 32:5; John 14:26). However, the
workings of this divine compass can be attenuated or nullified by seemingly small and
insignificant acts on your part. The Holy Ghost is ultra-sensitive to contention, your unworthy
thoughts, desires, speech, overt and covert acts that deviate from strict obedience to God&#8217;s
commandments. Like the few small screws that gave a false direction to the airplane, inattention,
neglect, pride, rebellion, lack of faith, and ignorance place you in a state where you are no longer
worthy of the companionship of this divine Liahona (Spirit of God) and you are left to your own
finite wisdom as to direction and subsequent ultimate destination (Doctrine and Covenants 1:31-33).<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I suggest that cheerful compliance with and obedience to the God&#8217;s commandments will help you
draw ever closer to your Father in Heaven, and will enable you to complete your earth mission,
and give you a true direction to enable you to reach your final destination, the Celestial Kingdom,
and receive all that the Father has for his children that love Him and keep His commandments.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As a check as to the validity of you personal compass and the direction you are traveling, I
suggest that you evaluate your performance with the following list of commandments that
sometimes might be taken lightly and considered as no "Big Deal" because everyone is or is not
doing it. Or perhaps, it is inconvenient at the present time, and you have the intentions and will
make the proper adjustments to your personal compass sometime in the future. Remember the
small screws and their effect on the airplane and its mission. Make the proper calibrations to your
compass now so you can "fly right" and reach your proper destination.<br /></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I suggest that you establish your own true course and verify your own direction by evaluating
your performance in relationship to the following listed commandments. Do you?</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">&#160;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">1. Participate in personal prayer and scripture study on a regular daily basis.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">2. Observe the Sabbath Day and keep it holy.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">3. Pay an honest tithing and are generous in your fast offerings (Doctrine and
Covenants 119).</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">4. Keep the Word of Wisdom as contained in Doctrine and Covenants 89. Do you
wrest with this scripture to justify your non-compliance as you blindly follow
others that ignore the sacredness of this promise, or are not bound by the covenant
which you have made concerning all the commandments and laws of God?</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">5. Touch not the unclean thing. Avoid pornography, refrain from all premarital
sexual activity and maintain sexual purity through total abstinence prior to
marriage, and complete fidelity to your companion after marriage.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">6. Are you modest in your dress?</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">7. Avoid finding fault with those who preside over you.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">8. Magnify your church calling. Give your stewardship the attention and
dedication it requires. You represent the Lord in this sacred trust and office.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">9. Avoid all foul language and vulgar innuendoes, unclean stories, and taking the
name of the Lord in vain.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">10. Remember always the covenants you made when you were baptized, received
the priesthood, and when you received your endowment and sealing in the temple.
Renew these covenants on a weekly basis as you worthily partake of the
sacrament, that His Spirit may always be with you.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><font color="#000080">12. Always avoid &#8220;X&#8221; &amp; &#8220;R&#8221; rated movies, TV presentations, literature and
music. They have not the message, nor the power to instill virtue, honesty and
reverence for that which is holy in your heart.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">If you violate the commandments and do not keep the covenants you have made with the Father,
the influence of the Holy Ghost will depart from you, and you will have lost your compass and
sense of true direction. You will be under the influence of Satan and for you to get back on
course, repentance is in order. You must plead with God for forgiveness. You must manifest a
godly sorrow. All your sins must be sacrificed, restitution must be made, you must forgive
yourself; a broken heart and a contrite spirit must be placed on the altar, and your covenants must
be renewed which will bring you forgiveness of sin and will permit you to appear before the Lord
with clean hands and a pure heart, that His Spirit may always be with you. Thus, your true
direction will be confirmed, and your destination will always be sure. Always be worthy to hold a
current temple recommend.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In closing, I humble testify that I know that God lives. He is our Heavenly Father. We are His
children. We have the seeds of deity within us; we are heirs to godhood. We can obtain all that
the Father has through the atonement of Jesus Christ and by obedience to the laws and
ordinances of the gospel. I know that Jesus is the Christ, &#8220;The Anointed One.&#8221; He is the Firstborn
and the only Begotten of the Father. He is Lord of lords, King of kings, the Creator, the Savior,
and the God of the whole earth. He is my Deliverer, my Redeemer, and my Advocate with the
Father. He takes away my sins, He died for me. He gives me the Gift of the Holy Ghost, and
offers me eternal life. He is my friend, and I love Him. My only desire is to serve Him and to
please Him. Joseph Smith is the prophet of this last dispensation. He saw what he said he saw.
Gordon B. Hinckley is a prophet, seer and revelator. He holds all the priesthood keys on earth
today. The Church is true and the Book of Mormon is Another Testament of Jesus Christ.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">It is my prayer that the Lord will continue to watch over, bless and prosper each of you, and each
of your family members, as you press forward each day in magnifying your calling and in
sanctifying yourself through your efforts to establish and build Zion. May you find joy and
success in your studies, and in your service to others, and continually give thanks to Him from
whom all blessings flow, as you follow the guidance and direction and receive the comfort, and
the peace that only the Spirit gives to those who love the Lord and keep his commandments. I
humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">I express profound gratitude for the privilege and blessing of being with each of you.  I thank you
for the sacrifice and quality of your life that permit you to be here.  You are a very select group of
righteous young men and women who love the Lord and want above all else, to obey His
commandments.  As I look into your faces, I am touched to the very core of my being.  There is a
radiance, an excitement, an expression of calm assurance and above all, an aura of purity and
righteousness that emanate from you.  I am not speaking of physical beauty, although there is
much of that.  I refer to something far more important&#8212;the peace and power that radiate from
your worthy, righteous, purposeful lives.  I am sure you can feel it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Do you want to know how to get the most benefit from this time together?  Write down the
impressions you feel.  You would never think of going to a class at this university and never take
a note of what is said or ponder the meaning of principles communicated nor seek to incorporate
them into your life.   Nonetheless, that is what precisely some do when in a spiritual environment
where eternal truth is taught and confirmed by impressions of the Holy Spirit.  Make no such
mistake.  Apply the same principles you have learned to acquire, remember and use secular
knowledge to your pursuit of eternal truth.  Spiritual moments in life often come when it seems
difficult to record them.  Yet that special effort to crystalize in a permanent record sacred
impressions of the Holy Spirit is powerfully rewarded.  Begin now even if you have to borrow
paper and pencil to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">You are now making some of the most critically important decisions of your life&#8212;decisions that
will have a profound influence on your happiness, on what you will become and how you will
spend eternity. I have prayerfully sought guidance of the Lord to be able to share with you some
of the principles that guide correct decisions.  I know they are true.  They are founded in doctrine,
and they have been proven in the crucible of my own life.  In today&#8217;s world you do not have the
assurance of making the right choices in essential matters without divine guidance.  Later, I will
give suggestions concerning how that help can be obtained.  I pray that during this time together
the Lord will convey His message to your mind and heart through the Holy Spirit.  It will be a
message tailored to your personal needs.  Again, I strongly urge you to write down any
impressions that come to you.  That guidance from the Holy Spirit will be the most important
part of what will occur today.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">For a few minutes I would like to benefit from the participation of some of you by your use of the
microphones that have been explained to you.  If those of you who want to help will ask for a
microphone now it will save precious time.  I promise I won&#8217;t embarrass you.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">As two recent comments of President Hinckley are displayed think of how you would answer this
question:  Why can those two apparently conflicting statements of President Hinckley both be
true?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">&#8220;The traditional family is under heavy attack.  I do not know that things were worse in the
times of Sodom and Gomorrah. . . . We see similar conditions today.  They prevail all
across the world.  I think our Father must weep as He looks down upon His wayward sons
and daughters.&#8221;</span> <sup><font size="1">1</font></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">&#8220;Who in the earlier days could have dreamed of this season of opportunity in which we
live? . . . The Church is in wonderful condition . . . It will grow and strengthen. . . .It is
our opportunity and our challenge to continue in this great undertaking, the future of
which we can scarcely imagine.&#8221;</span> <sup><font size="1">2</font></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">[ Pause to discuss]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">In the October 2002 general conference, President Hinckley gave a stirring message entitled:
&#8220;The Marvelous Foundation of Our Faith.&#8221;   In it he boldly, eloquently, bore witness of the
essential elements of the Message of the Restoration, then made an urgent plea.  As I read that
plea think of how you personally can respond to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">&#8220;This must be our great and singular message to the world. . . . We testify in humility but
with gravity and absolute sincerity.  We invite all, the whole earth, to listen to this
account and take measure of its truth.  God bless us as those who believe in His divine
manifestations and help us to extend knowledge of these great and marvelous occurrences
to all who will listen.&#8221;</span> <sup><font size="1">3</font></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">[ Pause to discuss ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Will some of you please suggest how you can help respond to the following need described by
our inspired President Hinckley:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">&#8220;In the Church we are working very hard to stem the tide of . . . evil.  But it is an uphill
battle, . . . we are succeeding in a substantial way. . . .We must not give up.  We must not
become discouraged.  We must never surrender to the forces of evil.  We can and must
maintain the standards for which this church has stood since it was organized.  There is a
better way than the way of the world.&#8221;</span> <sup><font size="1">4</font></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">[ Pause to discuss ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Thank you for your valiant help and valuable suggestions.  You are most precious.  We will not
have further need of the microphones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Now let us soberly discuss the treacherous challenges that surround you and how to overcome
them.  The world is being engulfed in a rising river of degenerate filth, with the abandonment of
virtue, righteousness, traditional marriage, family life and personal integrity.  President Hinckley
has warned publicly that conditions are comparable to those of Sodom and Gomorrah, the
epitome of unholy life in the Old Testament.  However, while isolated then that condition is now
pervasive over the world.  Satan skillfully manipulates for his purposes the power of all types of
media and the broad avenues of communication.  His success has greatly increased worldwide
the extent and availability of such degrading and destructive influences.  In the past, generally
some effort was required to seek out such evil.  Now it saturates large portions of virtually every
environment throughout the world.  We cannot dry up the mounting river of evil influences for
they are the result of the exercise of moral agency divinely granted by Our Father to His children. 
But we can, with clarity, warn of the consequences of getting close to its enticing, devouring
current.  We can even provide life preservers for those caught in those vanquishing waters who
recognize the need for help.  Yet many are, and will be, so engrossed in the stimulation that
comes from such disobedience that they will not hear that warning voice.  Nonetheless, you must
do your best to communicate what has been restored to earth and is available to all who desire to
live a fullness of joy and a productive, growing life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">God has provided a way to live in this world and not contaminated by the degrading pressures
evil agents spread throughout it. You can live a virtuous, productive, righteous life, by following
the plan of protection created by your Father in Heaven.  It is contained in the scriptures and in
the inspired declarations of His prophets.  He tabernacled your intelligence with spirit and made
it possible for you to enjoy the wonder of a physical body.  When you do that in the ways He had
decreed, you will be abundantly blessed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Have you noticed how Satan&#8217;s technique is to capture the mind and emotions with flashing
images, blaring music, and the stimulation of every physical sense to excess.  As a result, there is
no opportunity to perceive the quiet promptings of the Spirit.  He strives at all costs to so fill life
with action, entertainment, and stimulation that an individual does not contemplate the
consequences of his tempting invitations.  Think of it.  Some are tempted to violate
commandments because of the seductive portrayal on movie, television, and computer screens of
drama where the violation of the most basic commandments of God are portrayed as acceptable. 
They are made to seem attractive, even desirable.  There seems to be no serious consequence,
rather apparent lasting joy and happiness.  But recognize that those scenarios are controlled by
scripts and actors.  The outcome of decisions made is likewise manipulated  to be whatever the
producer desires it to be.  Life is not that way.  Yes, moral agency allows choice to be made of all
the alternatives available to man.  You can choose what you will, but you can not control the
outcome of those choices.  Unlike the exploitive creations of man, Our Father in Heaven
determines the consequences of your choices.  Obedience will yield happiness while violation of
His commandments will not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Consider the lives of those individuals who create what for some are captivating images of life. 
They generally turn to the most vicious of the destructive influences they depict so appealingly in
electronic media.  They may be wealthy, but they are miserable.  Truly the statement of Alma, an
inspired prophet and compassionate father, is borne out in their lives: &#8220;wickedness never was
happiness.&#8221;</span><sup><font size="1">5</font></sup></span>&nbsp;

  }
</script>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Oh, if I but had the power to cause individuals tempted to experiment  with the
alluring offerings of Lucifer to calmly analyze the inevitable consequences of such choices, fewer
lives would be shattered by them.  No one would ever sample a touch of poison to satisfy the
curiosity of how it tastes.  The outcome would be disastrous.  In like manner no one can ever
sample those things that are forbidden of God, as destructive of happiness, and corrosive to
spiritual guidance, without tragic results.   That&#8217;s all I feel to say of the problem because I trust
you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Through an analogy I want to suggest for you a pattern of protection against the beckoning evil
around you.  This light bulb is made of carefully selected materials&#8212;as are you.  Its tungsten
filament will not melt under intense heat&#8212;nor need you wither under the flame of challenge. 
The shield of glass encloses a pure noble gas.  It assures that the glowing filament is protected
from destruction by the surrounding oxygen, which for it is a contaminated atmosphere.  In like
manner, your righteous life, worthy parents, friends and the guidance of the Holy Ghost provide a
protective shield for you.  The bulb glows with light as it is connected to a power source.  You
radiate precious light to others as you remain solidly connected to the power of God.  Avoid all
influences that could shatter your shell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Some say, &#8220;Well, my shell is strong, I&#8217;ve got a strong testimony.&#8221; I&#8217;ve heard someone say &#8220;I go
to the clubs to help the needy.&#8221; And I say, be careful of that shell. [Breaks the bulb] Now what do
I do? My protective shell is broken. Too often, when that occurs with violation of a
commandment, Satan astutely comes and says, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. You keep doing what you&#8217;ve been
doing, nobody will ever know the difference. I&#8217;ll give you another shell. A protective shell, same
deal, you won&#8217;t have any problems.&#8221; But look what happens when I try to connect that shell to
the power of God. [The bulb burns out] It is a fake shell. It&#8217;s filled with contamination. We know
that the only way to rectify a broken protective shell is simply through the process of repentance
with a judge in Israel, with someone who loves you, if you&#8217;ve made such a serious mistake, and
will help you be connected again to the power of God in your life to give light, hope, and
guidance to those around you. [Shows a new light bulb] I hope that will be a hook in your mind
that when you look at a light bulb you remember the need of a protective shell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">The power of God comes into our lives as a natural consequence of obedience to His
commandments and selfless service to His children.  Service without obedience does not qualify
and rarely is obedience alone sufficient.  Yet as you strive your best to be obedient to truth and
seek to serve others, He will work through you.  Often you will receive the greatest benefit as He
blesses others through your efforts to serve them.  Sometimes you touch lives profoundly that
you are not aware of being influenced by your actions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">One of the richest fruits of the Restoration are the scriptures.  When understood and lived, the
doctrines they contain powerfully motivate uplifting righteous behavior despite worldly decay. 
Our Father in Heaven knows His children.  He knew that many would choose the wrong paths
and that our period would be flooded with temptations of every order and iniquity in every
corner.  He also knew how you can live successfully in that environment.  His scriptures tell you
how it is done.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Consider these verses: &#8220;All things must come to pass in their time.  [He knew the challenges we
would face then gave this counsel.]   Wherefore, be not weary in well&#8211;doing, for ye are laying the
foundation of a great work.  And out of small things proceedeth that which is great. Behold, the
Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the
land of Zion in these last days.&#8221;</span> <sup><font size="1">6</font></sup>

    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">  &nbsp;That is a priceless promise.  As you continue to center your
mind and heart in Him, He will help you have a rich and full life no matter what happens in the
world around you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Your resolute study of the scriptures will distill guiding truth to your mind and heart.  Yet,
knowing truth does not alone release its power into your life.  You must live it consistently so
that the power of God with fortify your life and give you the strength to over come all that is
destructive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">No matter how difficult the problems that surround you, the Lord knows how to resolve them. 
As you exercise faith, doing what you can, He will help you handle those things within your
capacity.  He will bring into your path others to help you.  They could be parents who can
provide answers, priesthood leaders who can counsel and advise, understanding faculty or
administrative personnel, and friends who can give you support.  Through the avenue of prayer
and the path of inspiration, He will help you know what to do.  It is a process that takes time to
master, but knowing that it exists should give you great comfort as you face the difficult
decisions you must now make in life.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">The Lord puts challenges in your path to mold your character.  For your own personal growth, He
will often let you struggle with a matter for a while, even when you are pleading for help.  But as
you follow true principles, He will finally see you through.  When you are near your limit, turn to
Him for comfort, peace, and assistance.  He will send it through the quiet prompting of the Spirit. 
He will give reassurance, guidance, and power that are essential to find solutions for the
challenges of this world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">You are learning vital eternal lessons.  Be sure you understand them.  The Lord does not abandon
your urgent pleas nor is He ever, for even a moment, unmindful of your anguish and heartache. 
He hears every supplication.  He invariably answers according to spiritual law. Understanding
that law will help you appreciate how the Lord answers your prayers.  His silence and seeming
absence at times are powerful means of expanding your vision and understanding as you continue
in faith to do your best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Seldom will you receive all at once a complete answer from the Lord.  It will come a piece at a
time. Inspiration comes in packets so that you will develop and grow and not remain as a child,
given everything.  Also so that you will appreciate it; give thanks for it; treasure it; and apply it. 
Moreover, it will seldom come as the prayer is offered, rather in quiet moments when the Spirit
can most effectively touch your mind and heart.  Hence the need for periods of quiet time to keep
perspective and to be instructed and strengthened.  Discover how a clean, neat, quiet place can
enhance spiritual direction in your life.  In quiet peaceful moments, like those you can enjoy in
the Idaho Falls temple, and before long in your own temple here, seek to feel the love the Lord
has for you personally.  It is intense.  It will enrich you life with peace, confidence, and
contentment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">In closing I would share some of the innermost feelings of my heart.  I do not know when I will
have the opportunity to speak to you individually again.  Though life seems difficult now, hold
on to that iron rod of truth.  You are making better progress than you realize.  Your struggles are
defining character, discipline, and a confidence in the promises of your Father in Heaven and the
Savior as you consistently obey Their commandments.  You are so important.  You are so
needed.  There are so few willing to make the sacrifice you are making to live righteously.  You
will develop the sensitivity, love, and kindness to rejoice within the bonds of an eternal marriage. 
You will bless your children with insight the world can never give them.  Your example will set
the course of their life.  You are needed to strengthen the growing kingdom of the Lord and to be
the role models for so many who lack the light of truth you have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">With all the capacity that I possess, I counsel you to strengthen continually your testimony that
there is in very deed, an Heavenly Father who is in control.  You must come to really know more
of God, through the scriptures, prayer and the testimonies of His chosen.  Then He can guide you
in every circumstance.  He has a specific plan for your life.  When needed He will reveal parts of
that plan to you as you seek His guidance with faith and consistent obedience.  You may have
found portions of it realized already in your life.  His Son has made you free - not from the
consequences of your acts, but free to make choices.  Your Father&#8217;s eternal purpose is for you to
be successful in this mortal experience.  No matter how wicked those in the world become you
can have that blessing.  Be attentive to the personal guidance given to you through the Holy
Spirit.  Continue to live worthy to receive it.  Record it so that you can fulfill it.  Then it will be
available throughout your life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">I bear solemn testimony that I have been given an absolute witness that Jesus Christ lives. As you
avoid the pitfalls of Satan by following the principles that we have discussed, I bear witness that
He will guide you to the correct choices in the critical matters of your life. He loves you. It is
through his influence that you are here on this unique campus. We love you, we need you, we
trust you. In the holy name of the Savior, I invoke a blessing upon you, that through the Spirit
you&#8217;ll be prompted in those important decisions of your life and be fortified against the fiery
darts of the evil one, and recognize that all the fruits of a glorious life are within reach. You can
have them. I know He lives. I am His witness. Humbly I bear that witness as an expression of
love and gratitude to you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">During one of his post-resurrection visits the Savior of the world appeared to His Apostles 
and
gave them what some call the &#8220;Grand Commission.&#8221; It is recorded in Mark 16:14-20:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>. . . He appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and [He] upbraided them
with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which
had seen him after he was risen.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
them: they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and
sat on the right hand of God.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And [the Lord&#8217;s Servants] . . . went forth, and preached every where, the Lord
working with them, and confirming the word with signs following</i>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">That Grand Commission to take the <i>&#8220;gospel to all the world&#8221;</i> has never been
lifted. It is as much an obligation upon the Church today as it was then. Many of
you have helped fulfill that commission as you have gone to nations, kindreds,
tongues and people to carry the gospel message. As descendants of the Joseph
who was sold into Egypt, we are commissioned and we shoulder the responsibility
to preach the Restored Gospel. It has become our obligation both in our youth and
in our older years. It is a glorious plan that involves us in the Savior&#8217;s injunction
and gives us responsibilities and service opportunities from our teens through our
senior years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Spencer W. Kimball gave a landmark address to the Regional Representatives in 1974.
He said,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i> . . . when we have used the satellite and related discoveries to their greatest
potential and all of the media - the papers, magazines, television, radio - all in
their greatest power . . . <span style="font-weight: bold">then and not until then</span>, shall we approach the insistence
of (our) Lord and Master to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every
creature</i> (emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Note how President Kimball allows for future &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold">related discoveries</span>.&#8221; You and I recognize, with
the benefit of hindsight, that the Internet may be a partial fulfillment of that prophetic statement.
The World Wide Web was not simply the result of a government experiment gone right . . . but
seen today, it may very well be one of the ways through which the gospel is to go to all the world.
In 1992, when the Internet was still very young and its potential for good and ill uncertain, Elder
Dallin H. Oaks listened to the report of a committee on the future of Church communication. The
committee focused its discussion on the prospective benefits and drawbacks of using the Internet
as a means of conveying the message of the Restoration. Elder Oaks turned to the scriptures and
found scriptural application to the possibilities of this &#8220;on-coming&#8221; technology. In the Doctrine
and Covenants, he read:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Therefore, go ye into all the world; and unto whatsoever place ye cannot go ye
shall send, that the testimony may go from you into all the world unto every
creature </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 84:62).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Just as radio, television, satellite communications, mobile phones, the Internet, DVDs, and MP3s
would surprise our forefather, so, too, may forthcoming technological advances astound you
when you are shepherding your own grandchildren.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">With that as a backdrop, let us look at what has been done and is being done to carry the gospel
to the nations and peoples of the earth. It is a given that we will continue to go two-by-two as
missionaries. But as new hardware and software are developed, these devices may well be used
as an Elias, that the Elect of God may be prepared to be taught by His servants, <i>&#8220;line up line,
precept upon precept&#8221; </i>(See 2 Nephi 28:30).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Joseph Smith said</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated
every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every
ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall
say the work is done.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Again the words of President Kimball<i> &#8220;&#8230;<span style="font-weight: bold">then and not until will we approach the insistence of
the Lord and Master&#8230; ring in our ears</span> (emphasis added).&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the <i>Book of Mormon</i>, the precious text of king Benjamin&#8217;s address to his people is recorded. It
is the only complete sermon on record. What at times may go unnoticed is how King Benjamin
and those who assisted him use what we might call the media. First, he used the <span style="font-weight: bold">spoken word</span>. It
is recorded in Mosiah chapter 2 that <i>&#8220;he caused a tower to be erected, thereby his people might
hear the words which he should speak to them.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Then after he had reached as may as possible by speaking from the tower, he <i>&#8220;&#8230;caused that the
<span style="font-weight: bold">words which he spake should be written </span>and sent forth among those that were not under the
sound of his voice, that they might also receive his words&#8221; </i>(See Mosiah 2: 7-8, emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">1) A tower or communications vehicle was used, 2) the spoken word and 3) the written word
were used to reach the people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It is interesting to note that from the early days of the Restoration, the leaders of the Church have
used the communications tools available at the time to spread the gospel to the world. First came
the <span style="font-weight: bold">spoken word</span> as Joseph Smith taught of his Restoration experiences. Then later the
missionaries went from door to door and congregation to congregation, community to
community preaching <span style="text-decoration: underline">the word</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The printed text was vital during the early days of the Church. As soon as the <i>Book of Mormon</i>
could be printed it became a principal instrument of conversion. As Church membership
increased, Parley P. and Orson Pratt produced the first missionary tracts in 1837 - the first of
which was called, &#8220;The Voice of Warning.&#8221; On  May 6, 1922 the President of the Church, Heber
J. Grant, and his wife would participate in the first radio broadcast on top of a building across
from Temple Square. This early radio station would become KSL.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A year later, in 1923, radio transmitters allowed 4,000 saints sitting on the grounds of Temple
Square to hear the proceedings of General Conference. President Hinckley, then Church
employee Hinckley, wrote radio and film scripts and traveled to New York City and Hollywood
to produce radio programs that reached thousands and perhaps millions of people. It was the
theater of the imagination. Book of Mormon stories, sermons, the Tabernacle Choir and radio
advertisements - were used as missionary tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Then along came television. Again the Church took advantage of this new medium to tell the
gospel story to millions of people. Television specials featuring the Tabernacle Choir were
produced. The best known of these is probably <i>Mr. Kruger&#8217;s Christmas</i>, which has become a
classic. You may remember <i>The Last Leaf, Nora&#8217;s Christmas,</i> and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Perhaps the most successful public service campaign in U.S. History has been the Homefront
series. Centered on family themes, these so called &#8220;Mormon ads&#8221; established the name of the
church and the Church&#8217;s strong family emphasis in the minds of millions of people over a thirty-year span.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Not long after President James E. Faust was called into the First Presidency he was asked with he
thought President Hinckley&#8217;s contribution would be. President Faust thoughtfully replied, &#8220;I
believe President Hinckley will bring the Church out of obscurity&#8221; (personally verified with
President Faust). In addition to pioneering media production as a Church employee, President
Hinckley&#8217;s use of the media during his presidency has been itself a marvelous work and a
wonder. During the Olympics President Hinckley did 13 major interviews with reporters from
newspapers and television stations from  the U.S., Japan, Austria, and Germany to name a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley also met with numerous heads of state who came to the Olympics. In fact,
President Hinckley said that he wanted to see every visitor of note who wanted to meet  &#8220;The
Mormon Pope.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Having established the premise that the Lord expects the Church to use the media to reach His
children, let me illustrate another way the media was used to communicate the gospel message
during this Olympic period. NBC executives invited the Church to make a presentation to the
300 local station executives from across the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Another avenue for telling the story of the Restoration, which you may or may not have
considered, is the open house period before the dedication of a temple. The accelerated pace at
which we have been building temples in the last few years, has provided more opportunities for
government officials, communities, neighbors and friends of other faiths to learn about latter-day
prophets, priesthood authority and forever families. We often speak of temples as being a light to
the world. Some of the most profound and moving gospel teaching I have ever seen has been in
temples when I have seen General Authorities teach the plan of salvation to government and
community leaders, and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The story of Small Temples in our day is a remarkable one! In 1998 President Hinckley went to
Colonia Jaurez to be part of the Centennial Celebration of the Juarez Academy. He was given a
list of the General Authorities who had come from the Colonies in Mexico. It is an impressive
list and through the years has included many Seventy, members of the Twelve Apostles and even
members of the First Presidency. President Hinckley was impressed with the faithfulness of the
saints and that they went clear to Mesa Arizona for their temple work. It was in connection with
this experience that President Hinckley received the inspiration for the smaller temples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Hinckley told the <i>Church News </i>that on the way home, <i>&#8220;I took a piece of paper and
sketched out the [floor] plan and turned it over to the architects to refine it.&#8221; </i>(<i>Church News</i>,
August 1, 1998)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I was in the room when he gave his foot print of the small temple to the Physical Facilities
directors. He said, &#8220;Get this done right away, hire more architects if you need to, but get it done!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">At first the President referred to these new buildings as endowment houses. But as he visited the
first one to be built in Monticello, Utah, the Saints came to him and thanked him for &#8220;their
temple.&#8221;  President Hinckley was at peace with the concept - they were temples.  All the
ordinances that could be performed in a large temple could also bless the lives of members in
remote places. Just think - Rexburg is to have its own temple. What a blessing it will be for you!
What a marvelous and significant addition a house of personal revelation will be to you as
students and faculty!  &#8220;The House of the Lord, Holiness to the Lord&#8221; will be engraved on its
walls just as the Spirit of the Lord will engrave great personal inspiration upon your hearts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Church produced a documentary a couple of years ago comparing ancient and modern
temples. It is called, &#8220;Between Heaven and Earth.&#8221; It features several General Authorities and
some notable scholars. Among them is Kristor Stendal, former Dean of the Harvard Divinity
School and then the Bishop of Stockholm Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Let me share with you a few of the comments made by some of those who attended the Accra,
Ghana Temple Open House last December:</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">An inspector from the Ghana Immigration Service Training School:<i>&nbsp; &#8220;This temple
is the most beautiful and mighty building in the West Region of Africa. I feel so
proud that the Temple has been sited in my country. It has also (brought) me
nearer to the Almighty Father God. I wish I may be a member in the near time to
come&#8221;</i> (Recorded statements from VIP Open House for Accra, Ghana Temple,
December 1-2, 2003).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;Then, and only then&#8221;-when we have used inspired technologies and methods to their highest and
best use will we fully meet the Lord&#8217;s injunction to take the gospel to every nation, kindred,
tongue and people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If you haven&#8217;t looked at the Church&#8217;s websites - the Missionary pages, the Welfare Department&#8217;s
offering, &#8220;Provident Living&#8221; - if you haven&#8217;t used the Family History site with its millions upon
millions of names; if you haven&#8217;t looked at the pictures of temples or looked at the on-line press
kits available on the media pages, then you are missing some of the ways the Church is
communicating to the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now let me personalize this message a bit. We&#8217;ve been talking about taking the light of the
gospel to the nations. It is a gigantic task. Our studies show that after almost 175 years in many
nations, only small percentages of people know who we are, much less have any idea about our
doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">For the Church to come out of obscurity and out of darkness and to <i>&#8220;shine forth fair as the moon,

the individual member must personally reflect that sacred light. No technology can replace the
power that comes through the lives of those who keep their covenants and radiate the gospel of
peace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Once again, studies commissioned by the Church&#8217;s Department of Public Affairs show that the
most successful communications tool the Lord has on the earth is you, Y-O-U, the individual
member who is living the gospel. You, the member of Christ&#8217;s Church are the light on the hill.
You are the example, the instrument, the most priceless technology-that the Lord may use to
reach many of His children. People we survey feel better about individual members than they do
about the Church itself. That places a lot of responsibility on each of us.</span></p>

Helping Us &quot;Out of the Pit&quot;</font></span></p>

<p>Imagine yourself lost at the bottom of a deep pit &#8211; a pit so big that other people are there with
you, a massive pit large enough for homes and villages to be scattered around the bottom like the
Havasupai Indians living in their &#8220;land of the sparkling blue-green waters&#8221; at the bottom of the
Grand Canyon.  But this deep pit has no trails in or out &#8211; just steep walls surrounding it, and you
have no equipment to climb out.</p>
<p>With your independent human spirit you want to get out of this pit so you call out to those you
assume live up beyond the rim.  You call from different locations at various times day and night
and you finally hear a faint whisper of a voice calling back.  But, no further communication or
help comes.  Would you be glad or mad that you heard the voice, that you knew there was life up
beyond the rim of the pit?  But what if you had not really heard a voice?  Those around you at the
time did not hear it, although others at different times and occasions did claim to hear voices. 
You could just stay in that pit and continue life there.  But you want to get up out of the pit and
return back home.</p>
<p>Then one day as you are walking along where the cliffs and the pit valley floor meet, you come
across something unnatural.  Hanging from the top of the cliff is a thin synthetic line almost
invisible like the fishing line you would use in a mountain stream.  You pull on the line and it
seems anchored at the top.  It is not strong enough to lift you, but you wonder, &#8220;Should I attach a
message to this line so that it could be carried to the top?&#8221;  Or, &#8220;Is this line the beginning of an
attempt by somebody to connect some kind of telephone line or steel cable to the valley floor?&#8221; 
Indeed, &#8220;Does this line prove that there is life up beyond the rim?&#8221;</p>
<p>Closer observation reveals that the line is a thin fiberoptic cable, capable of transmitting sounds
and sights.  But do you have the technological equipment to connect with those on the other end
of this line?  And more significantly, could they lead you back home?</p>
<p>These are the kinds of feelings and questions we have while wandering and wondering in this pit
of a telestial earth, this lone and dreary world.  We can get by and even enjoy life here, but we
sense there is a better life up beyond the rim.  At times we hear faint whisperings and find thin
connections from the heavens above, but we need to connect more firmly with those up there
beyond the rim of our natural experience.</p>
<p>We establish and then strengthen our firm connections with God through covenants.  Covenants
are our bond with the Divine.  They connect us with Heavenly Father in various ways:</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#10146;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Covenants open communication links more clear than any super wideband fiberoptic
cable.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#10146;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Covenants access spiritual gifts more wonderful than any technological equipment. </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#10146;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Covenants rescue us from deeper and more varied pits than any steel cable.</p>
<p>In so many ways, covenants connect us to the Divine with all His love and glory.  Before
illustrating how covenants might actually help us back home, let us review what a covenant is
and what the six basic elements of a covenant are.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">What is a covenant?</span></i></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s first be clear about what a covenant is.  The standard definition of a &#8220;covenant&#8221; is: &#8220;a
solemn agreement between two or more parties.&#8221; A covenant is a compact between these parties
in which promises are made and conditions are agreed upon, usually in the presence of witnesses. 
&#8220;A solemn agreement between two or more parties&#8221; implies that all parties are willing
participants in the covenant arrangement.  Granted, one of the parties may have drafted the terms
of the contract and may have greater power and administrative authority in the covenant
agreement &#8211; such as a king entering into a vassal treaty with a lesser ruler or as God providing
and defining our covenant opportunities with Him.</p>
<p>There are two types of covenant relationships presented in the Scriptures -- horizontal and
vertical.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Horizontal</span> covenants are where human beings enter into a peer covenant relationship
with each other.  As a Book of Mormon example, Captain Moroni made covenants with some
Nephites that they would keep the peace in the land (Alma 46:31) and later with some Lamanites
that they would no more take up their weapons of war against the Nephites (Alma 62:16).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Vertical</span> covenants are between God and mortals, either individually or collectively.  The Book of
Mormon teachings of Nephi, Jacob, King Benjamin, Alma, the resurrected Savior, Mormon and
Moroni  enrich our understanding of God&#8217;s covenants (1 Nephi 13-15; 2 Nephi 9-10; Mosiah 5-6,
18; 3 Nephi 15-16, 20-22, 29; Mormon 8; Moroni 10). <sup><font size="1">1</font></sup></p>
<p>Heavenly Father has always seemed anxious to make covenants with us.  Early in our pre-mortal
existence he made promises which resulted in our present circumstances on this earth.  God made
special covenant promises with Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham and others of our ancestors.  The
covenants made with Abraham carry on to include us today.  Almost four thousand years ago
Abraham was given three promises by the Lord which are still in the process of fulfillment:
Abraham would have a numberless posterity, lands in the Middle East were to be his family&#8217;s
inheritance, and his descendants would be a blessing to all nations and families of the earth. 
These promises were renewed through Isaac, Jacob and the house of Israel.  We are the heirs of
these promises as we individually honor our covenants and prove to be a blessing in the lives of
others.  The scriptures provide a record of the Abrahamic covenant and its prophesied fulfillment
in the latter days.  The scriptures contain so many of God&#8217;s covenant promises that another
common definition of &#8220;covenant&#8221; is &#8220;a promise of God to His children.&#8221;  To combine the
common two definitions of &#8220;covenant,&#8221; we might say that a covenant is &#8220;a solemn agreement
between God and His children containing His promises to us.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">What does it mean &#8220;to covenant?&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p>Let us move from English definitions to the language roots of the Old Testament and briefly
discuss some ancient meanings of &#8220;covenant&#8221; and &#8220;covenant making.&#8221;  &#8220;Covenant&#8221; in the Old
Testament derives from the Hebrew word<i> be'rith</i>.  The noun <i> be'rith</i> also joins with a common
verb to describe the process of entering into a covenant.  The technical Old Testament phrase for
&#8220;making a covenant&#8221; is <i>karat be'rith</i>, meaning literally &#8220;to cut a covenant,&#8221; or &#8220;to cut a bond.&#8221; 
This Hebrew construct is similar to the English legal phase &#8220;to cut a contract,&#8221; or, as expressed in
the vernacular, &#8220;to cut a deal.&#8221;   The origin of this expression may lie in the ancient covenant
ceremony practice of sacrificing animals by <span style="text-decoration: underline">cutting</span> their throats, which symbolized a point of
finalization in the contractual process.  In other words, when the two parties came to an
agreement, they would indicate it through an unusual act -- such as cutting the throat of an animal
to be used as a sacrificial offering or as the main dish for their celebration feast.  Today, we
would probably just &#8220;shake hands on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to which language etymology one follows, the term <i> be&#8217;rith</i>, usually translated as
&#8220;covenant&#8221; has various possible meanings, one of which fits into our analogy of trying to get out
of the deep pit.  One meaning of<i> be&#8217;rith</i> is a &#8220;bond&#8221; or &#8220;joining together.&#8221;  Scholars believe this
context derives from the Akkadian root <i>biritu</i>, which means to &#8220;fetter&#8221; or &#8220;chain.&#8221;  We may feel
uncomfortable with such strong language of being fettered or chained because, for us, a covenant
is not an obligatory or forceful type of binding together; it is to be a voluntary relationship. 
However, when there is a true mutual commitment between two parties, once they have made
their pact -- they are bound together!  As Latter-day Saints, we talk about a &#8220;new and everlasting
covenant&#8221; and being &#8220;sealed together,&#8221; such as in temple ordinances.  This joining together
represents an absolute, binding compact between God and His children (Doctrine and Covenants
82:10-11).  So to &#8220;cut a bond&#8221; can mean to bind yourself in a covenant like with chains of steel. 
It also implies a promised liberation, because if we maintain vows with a powerful, loving God,
He rescues us from death and spiritual bondage.</p>
<p>This promise of freedom is highlighted in the Book of Mormon as King Benjamin speaks to his
covenant Israelites as recorded in Mosiah, chapter 5.  The prophet and king, Benjamin, promises
the people: &#8220;because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of
Christ, ... and ... ye are made free&#8221; ( Mosiah 5:7-8).  It is through God&#8217;s gifts and covenants,
made effective through Christ&#8217;s atoning sacrifice, that we are delivered from the pits of death and
hell to achieve our ultimate, eternal destiny.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">What are the basic elements of a covenant?</span></i></p>
<p>In any covenant, certain and constant elements help to define the commitment relationship
between the respective parties.  Understanding these elements helps us appreciate various
dimensions of our covenant relationship with God.  The basic elements of a covenant are sixfold:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>First</i>, there is a preamble or preface in the covenant contract which introduces the
involved parties and the basic nature of the covenant.  This <span style="font-weight: bold">introduction</span> simply
brings the parties together so they can now enter into their agreement.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Second, </i>the <span style="font-weight: bold">historical context </span>of the covenant is presented, sometimes in great
detail.  This may seem unnecessary, but it is in ancient vassal treaties and in many
scriptural contexts, as we will see.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Third,</i> the <span style="font-weight: bold">stipulations</span> of the covenant are explained.  This &#8220;fine print of the
contract&#8221; is what we should seriously study when we evaluate any specific
covenant.  Before we enter into any contract, we should understand exactly what
we are agreeing to.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Fourth</i>, for any covenant to be binding, it must be duly witnessed or, as we say
today, &#8220;notarized by proper officials.&#8221;  To solidify the covenant agreement, a
multitude and variety of <span style="font-weight: bold">witnesses</span> are involved. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Fifth</i>, a listing of <span style="font-weight: bold">rewards and punishments</span>, or, as we would say in today&#8217;s
politically correct language, &#8220;incentives and penalties&#8221; are also part of a covenant. 
The rewards for proper and prompt adherence and punishments for the neglect or
disregard of covenant promises are an essential part of any contract.  Although
God&#8217;s blessings are great, the laws of His covenants usually stipulate that the
curses for breaking the covenant are severe.  Indeed, it would be far better to never
have made the covenant than to make and then break it without ever seeking
amends.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Sixth</i>, a record of the covenant is made and steps for its <span style="font-weight: bold">perpetuation</span> are outlined. 
A covenant, especially one with God, is rarely for just one time and place. 
Sometimes the covenant document needs to be brought forth and read aloud in the
presence of the covenant parties.   It usually needs to be reviewed, maybe even
revised, and regularly renewed so that it can continue to bless the relationship
between the individuals.</p>
<p>In review, the six elements of a covenant are: introduction, historical context, stipulations,
witnesses, rewards &amp; punishments, and perpetuation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">What covenant models do we have in the Church?</span></i></p>
<p>Lest we think these six covenant elements only belong to ancient Israelite communities, let&#8217;s
review how they are found in the Church today.  In fact, these elements are so much a part of our
being a covenant people that we may not appreciate how much they permeate our Latter-day
Saint society but we find all six elements in the ordinances of baptism, sacrament, and the
temple. </p>
<p>Baptism is the gateway covenant ordinance which establishes our membership in The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Simply stated, we were first introduced to the Church through
parents, members or missionaries. Then we were instructed about the life and mission of the
Savior and about the restoration, which provided the historical framework of our membership. 
We also learned the stipulations or commandments of Christ&#8217;s gospel which were expected of us
as Church members.  Our formal entrance into the Church at baptism was duly witnessed by two
priesthood holders.  Blessings and higher levels of accountability us as Church members. 
Finally, as members of record, we have had weekly opportunities to perpetuate our covenant
relationship through the sacrament.</p>
<p>Our most consistent covenant model is found in the sacrament.  Following the same six elements,
we first come together in a sacrament meeting to renew our covenants.  The sacrament hymn then
provides the historical framework as we come out of a worldly environment (and our wondering
why the bishop called <span style="font-weight: bold">that</span> person to the calling which we just sustained) and our thoughts are
turned to places like Gethsemane, Golgotha, and the Garden Tomb.  In precise wording, we agree
to take Christ&#8217;s name upon us, to always remember him, and to keep his commandments.  The
sacrament covenant is not only witnessed by the priesthood leaders, but we witness it to each
other as we individually partake of the bread and water.  Those around us can see and witness
that we have done an external act as a symbol of an internal commitment.  A wonderful blessing,
the companionship of the Holy Spirit, is promised in the prayers.  Once we have experienced that
blessing, to lose the Spirit is indeed a curse.  And finally, partaking of the sacrament is the latest
perpetuation or renewal of our covenant relationship with God.  </p>
<p>The temple provides the most sacred covenant opportunities for Latter-day Saints.  First, we
introduce or present ourselves at the temple with a valid temple recommend.  Second, as the
actual endowment session begins,  we go way back into an historical context and review the
premortal councils, the periods of creation, and the actions of Adam and Eve in the Garden. 
Third, although one would expect to learn a lot of detail about temple covenants and their
stipulations during the endowment session, the covenants themselves are just introduced, briefly
defined and explained in the temple.  However, we are told where we can learn more about them
&#8211; &#8220;in the scriptures!&#8221;  Thus a conscientious study of the scriptures and their covenant teachings is
an excellent preparation for going to and returning to the temple.  Fourth, there are special
witnesses for every endowment session.  We not only have a designated couple represent the
company, but we also enter into our sacred covenants in the Lord&#8217;s house in the presence of God
and angels.  Fifth, detailed rewards and punishments are not explained in the endowment, but
they are found in the scriptures as we learn about the solemn nature of sacred covenants.  Finally,
the specific date and temple where we received our endowment is recorded in our individual
membership record, and we renew our temple covenants as we partake of the sacrament. Like the
ancient Israelites, Latter-day Saints are indeed a temple worshiping, covenant people.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">How covenants can deliver us from the pit</span></i></p>
<p>Let us now return to our analogy of the deep pit and see how five different covenants can take us
up beyond the rim.  Let&#8217;s assume that somehow we are able to connect with that thin fiberoptic
line that we found dangling from the cliff.  Through this communication link we are able to gain
instructions that will help us out of the pit.  But knowing what to do is not enough, we must act
upon that knowledge to get ourselves over the rim.  Our covenants with the powers above will
empower our actions.  Let&#8217;s discuss how five critical covenants help us out of this pit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Baptism: the gateway covenant</i></p>
<p>First, we receive communication through the fiberoptic line and we are instructed about how to
braid a special rope which will serve many roles in helping us out of the pit.  The rope will help
the first workers to build a trail along the cliff wall as it anchors them to the rock and connects
them safely to each other.  The rope can also be made into bridges and ladders to assist them and
later travelers over difficult obstacles.  It can be woven into nets and barriers to provide
protection along dangerous passages.  With its many functions, this good strong rope will help us
out of the pit.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father has provided a multi-functional aide like the rope to help us back into His
presence.  But it is only given to us after we have made an initial covenant with Him &#8211; the
gateway covenant of baptism.  As Jesus promised Nicodemus, except a person &#8220;be born of water
and of the Spirit&#8221; he or she cannot enter into the kingdom of God. (John 3:5.)  The promised
reward of the baptismal covenant is receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.  The companionship of
this third member of the Godhead helps us in various ways.  As expressed in a &#8220;Belief
Statement&#8221; from the book <i>Principles and Practices of the Restored Gospel</i>, &#8220;The Holy Ghost is a
spirit personage who serves as a revelator of truth, a witness of God's work, and a comforter for
the human soul&#8221; (Pages 65, 641.).  Revealed insights, strong confirmations, and comforting
strengths are significant roles of the Holy Spirit which could help us out of the pit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Sacrament: the renewal covenant</i></p>
<p>Next, we need to recognize that this precious rope can be cut, frayed or lost.  We not only must
protect it in its dangerous environment, we must strengthen and replace it as needed.  This
renewing and strengthening of our spiritual companionship comes through the sacrament.  We all
sin and thus in one way or another we all damage our connection with the Holy Spirit.  It is not
enough to have felt powerful spiritual witnesses earlier in our life &#8211; we need to have the Spirit
with us now and always (meaning &#8220;all the way&#8221;) as we try to get out of the pit.</p>
<p>The promise of the sacrament is that we can always have His Spirit with us, because if it is not
with us &#8220;all the way,&#8221; we will never make it back to God&#8217;s presence.  We can&#8217;t just have the
Spirit here and there along the way, we need His guidance, gifts and power all the way to the end. 
Just as abundant, strong rope could help us in multiple ways to get us out of a physical pit, the
companionship and abundant gifts of the Holy Spirit assist us out of spiritual darkness.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Priesthood: the service covenant</i></p>
<p>So, with this rope we are ready to build a trail out of the pit, but we need a lot of workers, strong,
powerful workers, to do the work.  People living in the pit might not want to do all this work
because it takes them away from their other activities.  They might not want to serve others who
are weak or in need.  But there are some of God&#8217;s sons here in this telestial pit who are willing to
enter into an oath and covenant of the priesthood to help and serve others.  They survey the cliff
walls, map out possible routes, and work together to place anchors, clips, pulleys and other aids
so that a trail can be built that will benefit anyone who wants to travel on it.  If you have ever
tried to hike or travel through a wilderness area without a trail, you know what a blessing it is to
have trailblazers prepare the way and to have guides assist along the way.  Likewise, priesthood
holders should make life better for others.  </p>
<p>As the Lord teaches us about the &#8220;oath and covenant of the priesthood,&#8221; we learn that faithful
priesthood holders are &#8220;sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies&#8221; (Doctrine and
Covenants 84:33).  This promise refers ultimately to a celestial resurrection, but I believe it is a
promise for this life as well,  while we are still in the pit.  As servants in the Kingdom, we need
to be refined and motivated by the Spirit and to be uplifted and energized in our bodies so we can
do the necessary work in raising our families, helping others, and furthering the mission of
Christ&#8217;s church.  Hard working priesthood bearers, honoring their priesthood oath and covenant
will help us out of the pit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Endowment: the gift covenant</i></p>
<p>However, these workers need special tools and equipment to get the trail work done &#8211; bare
hands, sticks and rope will not make a trail through rocky walls.  Rugged hand tools and
powerful machines are needed for this difficult project. And if the workers do not have this
essential equipment with them in the pit, it will have to be delivered from above.  When
something is given or bestowed upon a person, it is called a gift or endowment.  One attends the
temple to receive an endowment.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the &#8220;endowment&#8221; is a special gift from God which helps His children
qualify for His special celestial blessings.  Presented by means of a symbolic drama, the
endowment is a gift of special spiritual knowledge.  The New Testament phrase &#8220;to endow&#8221;
comes from the Greek <i>enduein</i>, meaning &#8220;to put on&#8221;: both to clothe, put on garments, etc. or to
put on attributes, receive virtue, etc. (<span style="text-decoration: underline">EM</span> 454).  As noted in this root meaning, &#8220;to be endowed&#8221;
involves both external acts (such as putting on sacred clothing) and internal edification (such as
committing to righteous behavior).  As highlighted in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism, the
essential, cardinal teachings of the endowment place the entire gospel structure into a divinely
inspired eternal framework (<span style="text-decoration: underline">EM</span> 455, 1460).  This elevated perspective reveals about life beyond
the rim and gives us spiritual directions about the path we must follow to return to our heavenly
home.</p>
<p>Beyond providing instruction, the endowment gives opportunity for personal commitment.  The
divine knowledge in the temple endowment is given only in conjunction with certain specific
covenants, which commit us to principles of devotion, charity, righteousness, purity, and
diligence.  We follow Adam's example as we promise to obey God and to sacrifice our time and
talents in building His kingdom.   We also covenant to keep the laws of the gospel in a spirit of
unity.  We then declare our sincere intentions to follow the laws of chastity and consecration,
signifying the degree of purity and commitment which God desires of His dedicated disciples
(<span style="text-decoration: underline">EM</span> 455, 1444).  </p>
<p>Having thus pledged our all to the Lord and His kingdom on earth, we are then privileged to
receive certain blessings or &#8220;keys&#8221; in the form of specialized instruction necessary to return back
to God's celestial realm.  These keys help us learn how to petition Heavenly Father in the true
order of prayer and they give us instruction about regaining His pure, celestial kingdom.  The
endowment session symbolically takes us into the realm of God, into the celestial room.  If we
keep our temple covenants, these keys will someday admit us to God's celestial kingdom (<span style="text-decoration: underline">EM</span>
455, 1444, 1460).  These keys are the essential tools we need to get out of the pit and to enter
those heavenly realms beyond the rim. <sup><font size="1">2</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Sealing: the bonding covenant</i></p>
<p>As we complete this difficult trail out of the pit and we are almost to the rim, we find one last
unexpected obstacle.  Beyond getting out of the pit, we need to be brought into the community
above.  We assumed that we would be welcomed by those living up beyond the rim, but we find
out we must first be accepted and comfortable as compatible members of their special society. 
We need to bond with these people in a certain social order &#8211; as eternal families.  </p>
<p>To receive exaltation in the highest degree of God's celestial kingdom, yet another temple
ordinance and covenant is required &#8211; celestial marriage and the sealing of families into an eternal
union.  A &#8220;sealing&#8221; means the securing of a lasting bond.  A bond is defined as a special
agreement or a covenant.  Temple sealings refer to the marriage of a husband and wife and the
joining together of children and parents into the family order of God's celestial society.  Sealings
bind us together with a chain that is not easily broken.  As the culminating temple ordinance, a
sealing ceremony is an inspiring and solemn rite performed in specially dedicated sealing rooms
of the temple.  The family unit begins with the sealing of a man and a woman in holy matrimony. 
They make sacred commitments to God and each other as they enter into the new and everlasting
covenant of eternal marriage.  An officiator performs the sealing in the presence of two
witnesses.  Close friends and family members usually witness the ceremony as well.  Sealings
become a spiritual foundation for a marriage and family -- they sustain the family in life and
unite its members after death (<span style="text-decoration: underline">EM</span> 1289).  These sealings eternally bind in heaven that which is
performed and sanctified on earth.  </p>
<p>To summerize these five essential covenants, &#8220;Latter-day Saints, like the ancient Israelites, are a
covenant people who worship in temples where they learn about their relationship with God,
make sacred commitments, receive key directions about returning to God's presence, and do
ordinance work for their deceased relatives&#8221; (PPRG, pages 371-72, 643.).  These temple
ordinances are sacred rites and covenants which bind us to our Heavenly Father.  And as we are
bound together with God, He can rescue us from the deep pits of ignorance, worldliness,
selfishness and sinfulness.  As members of a covenant community, we become integrated with
other celestial people.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">What are the purposes of covenants</span></i><span style="font-weight: bold">?</span></p>
<p>Knowing <span style="text-decoration: underline">what</span> covenants are and <span style="text-decoration: underline">how</span> they can help us upwards towards celestial life, it is also
helpful to appreciate <span style="text-decoration: underline">why</span> God uses covenants to bind our relationship with him.  Heavenly
Father&#8217;s work and glory is to &#8220;bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man&#8221; (Moses
1:39).  And, Christ&#8217;s ultimate commandment to us is to become &#8220;perfect, even as your Father
which is in heaven is perfect&#8221; (Matthew 5:48).  For us to achieve these divine purposes, we need
help.  I believe there are at least four sets of reasons why covenants are so valuable for us to
achieve our eternal destiny:</p>
<p><i>Teachings and Guidelines:</i>  First, covenants provide valuable teachings and guidelines,
informing us of God&#8217;s expectations.  As we prepare to enter into covenants, we receive
instruction about their doctrinal framework.  We are taught the commandments which God
expects of us.  The laws and commandments attached to the covenants teach us how to draw
nearer to God and how to become more like Him. This instruction provides gospel teachings and
guidelines which give us direction as we commit ourselves to keep His commandments.</p>
<p><i>Incentives and Rewards:</i>  Second, covenants give us incentives and rewards.  Sometimes the
blessings of a particular commandment or covenant are so important to us that we receive extra
motivation to be obedient.  Such incentives can be a positive influence in our lives to counter the
many frustrations and negative enticements which surround us.  The Lord promises to bless us as
we obey His laws, and this gives us encouragement to remain faithful.  Granted, eventually we
will want to do good for good&#8217;s sake and to keep our covenants because that&#8217;s really what we
want to do, not just because we want to receive rewards.  But in the meantime, and as a motivator
in moments of weakness, covenant incentives and rewards encourage us to stay on the path
towards God.</p>
<p><i>Gateways and Ordinances:</i>  Third, covenants are required gospel gateways and ordinances we
must pass through if we want to return to God&#8217;s presence.  Covenants define essential
commitments and ordinances which God requires of us as we seek to return to his celestial realm. 
Certain covenant gateways, such as baptism, are absolutely essential for <span style="text-decoration: underline">all</span> of us, even Jesus, the
Son of God.  After passing through the gates of water and spirit baptism, we then prepare to enter
into higher temple covenants, drawing us closer to God's highest glory.  When we are willing and
worthy to enter into these higher covenants, we sense we are getting closer to our highest
potential -- the gateway of eternal life.  We must participate in these ordinances if we want to
fulfill our divine destiny.</p>
<p><i>Patterns and Measurements:</i>  Fourth, covenants develop patterns and measurements of righteous
behavior.  As we not only enter into but also keep our basic covenant commitments, patterns of
obedience make it easier for us to make and keep higher and higher levels of covenants. 
Knowing God&#8217;s expectations for us and then committing to them through a covenant act provides
us with a somewhat objective means of measuring our religious performance.  Our progress on
the path of life is verified and we feel trustworthy for greater opportunities of service.  As we
establish patterns of obedience, this behavior becomes a part of our eternal nature.  We gradually
become the type of person who is dedicated to goodness, love, and righteousness.  By keeping
covenants and being faithful in what may seem to be little things, we are proven worthy to
receive greater things, even eternal life. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">Keeping covenants</span></i></p>
<p>After we understand how and why covenants help us, we need to decide what we personally
should do about our covenant relationship with God.  Three key words describe the steps of
keeping covenants.  First, we need to <span style="text-decoration: underline">know</span> God&#8217;s covenants so we can properly connect with our
Heavenly Father.  Studying the Scriptures, learning the counsel of God&#8217;s prophets, and following
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit will help us know God&#8217;s covenants and how we should live
them.  Second, we need to <span style="text-decoration: underline">do</span> God&#8217;s covenants so we can experience His bonding power.  Divine
gifts and blessings are made manifest through the Holy Spirit after we make baptismal covenants
and then renew them through the sacrament.  Further powers and rewards come to us through the
priesthood and temple as we make and keep higher, sacred covenants.  Third, we need to <span style="text-decoration: underline">become</span>
God&#8217;s covenant children so we can be sanctified through the Holy Spirit and then effectively use
His spiritual gifts to serve others.  We are then ready to help the next generations along the
covenant path towards celestial life.</p>
<p>Having prepared six children for the temple; having taught the temple preparation course and
conducted numerous temple preparation firesides; and having conducted many temple
recommend interviews in various ecclesiastical callings &#8211; may I now please share two valuable
pieces of advice with you?</p>
<p>First, prepare yourself for the temple with integrity.  By &#8220;integrity&#8221; I exhort you to be absolutely
honest in your temple recommend interviews with your ecclesiastical leaders.  Realize that this
interview is a means for both a common judge in Israel and you to evaluate if you are already
doing that which you soon will solemnly covenant to continue doing.   In the temple you will not
be asked to do anything new or more challenging beyond what you need to do to enter the temple
in the first place.  For example, you should be keeping the law of chastity before you receive your
temple recommend and then in the temple you make a sacred covenant to thereafter keep that
commandment.  Be a trustworthy person of integrity.</p>
<p>My second piece of advice is to involve others as you prepare for your covenants and as you
strive to keep them.  By ourselves, we are weak and fallible.   Companions, friends and family
are invaluable sources of counsel and strength.  As we have learned with exercise programs,
exam preparations, business ventures and other endeavors in life, we are far more likely to
succeed if we know others have an interest and involvement in our success.  Most importantly,
keep the Holy Ghost as your constant companion.  This divine friend will not lead you astray.  He
will give you insight as you study your covenants, He will strengthen you as you strive to keep
your covenants, and He will purify you as covenants help you become a true child of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold"><i>Conclusion</i></span></p>
<p>In conclusion, let us assume God&#8217;s covenants have helped us out of the pit.  We are now over the
rim and in those celestial realms with God, His Son, the Holy Spirit, the prophets and our family
and friends.  What do you assume we are doing now?  Are we just recycling the communication
lines, helpful ropes, tools, equipment and other aids which help people out of their own pits? 
No, we are actually &#8220;angelfacturing&#8221; more of them.  (For those of you unacquainted with this
process, <span style="font-weight: bold">angel</span>facturing is a much more environmentally friendly process than &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold">man</span>ufacturing.&#8221;) 
We angelfacture covenant opportunities for future endless generations of spirit children who, in
turn, will be sent out to countless worlds yet unorganized</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">where they can call out to the heavens and listen for a gentle voice,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">where they can connect with a communication line to the realms above,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">where they can follow the path back home through sacred covenants, and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">where they can establish their personal eternal bond with the Divine.</p>
<p>Covenants help us in so many ways as we sojourn on earth and try to get out of this telestial pit. 
Covenant teachings give us direction so we <span style="text-decoration: underline">know</span> what to do.  Covenant rewards encourage us to
stay on the correct path and covenant ordinances define what is expected of us as we <span style="text-decoration: underline">do</span> God&#8217;s
will.  And covenant patterns develop consistent righteous behavior as we <span style="text-decoration: underline">become</span> His true
children.  Without covenants, we would be lost and frustrated, eternally stranded in the pit.  With
covenants, we not only draw nearer to our Heavenly Father and Elder Brother and bond with
them, but we also become more like them, eternally.</p>
<p>Thus we see that God's covenants, along with their attached laws, commandments and promises,
give us hope and help in reaching towards eternal life &#8211; celestial life up beyond the rim of this
telestial pit.</p>
<p><font size="1">1.&nbsp; The scriptures not only provide details about the 
    specific covenants but they also give the eternal context of our covenant

    also the future prophetic promises for their blessings and fulfillment.</font></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">My dear young friends, it is a joy to be with you, and I pray that the Spirit will speak to each of
you who are ready to hear what He has to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">A few weeks ago while meeting with President Gordon B. Hinckley, he asked how work was
going. Among other things, I told him about a difficult decision I had made that in retrospect I
now realized I should have made earlier. &#8220;President, I just wish I were smarter,&#8221; I confessed.
Without missing a beat, he replied, &#8220;I wish you were smarter, too.&#8221; Then, after pausing for effect,
he added, &#8220;I wish we were all smarter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Here at this institution of higher learning, you&#8217;re well aware of the advantages of being smart.
Today I want to talk with you about a virtue that is just plain smart and that will have as much
impact on your happiness, your peace of mind, and your ability to fulfill your life&#8217;s mission as
any virtue I can think of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">It is a virtue that will ultimately make you or break you. It will make or break you as a husband
or wife, father or mother, brother or sister, colleague or friend or leader. It will make or break
your career. And most significantly, it will make or break your efforts to achieve exaltation. For
it will define your relationship with God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">This is a virtue that 
every man or woman of God must come to possess in increasing degrees. It is a 
virtue found in every true follower of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="text-decoration: underline">It is the virtue of integrity</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We tend to define integrity as honesty. And without question, it includes that. But telling the
truth is just the beginning of integrity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">President Joseph F. Smith called integrity<i> &#8220;the cornerstone of character&#8221; </i>(4 April 1897 General
Conference). And President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke of integrity this way: <i>&#8220;Men and women
of integrity understand intrinsically that theirs is the precious right to hold their heads in the
sunlight of truth, unashamed before anyone&#8221; </i>(Standing for Something, 29).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">An incident in the life of President Joseph F. Smith bears out this point. In the fall of </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">1857, the nineteen-year-old Joseph F. was returning from his mission in Hawaii, and in
California he joined a wagon train. It was a volatile time for the Saints. Johnston&#8217;s Army was
marching towards Utah, and many had bitter feelings towards the Church. One evening several
hoodlums rode into camp, cursing and threatening to hurt every Mormon they could find. Most in
the wagon train ran and hid in the brush. But Joseph F. thought to himself: &#8220;Shall I run from
these fellows? Why should I fear them?&#8221; With that, he walked up to one of the intruders who,
with pistol in hand, demanded, &#8220;Are you a Mormon?&#8221; Joseph F. Smith responded, &#8220;Yes siree;
dyed in the wool; true blue, through and through.&#8221; At that, the hoodlum grasped his hand and
said, &#8220;Well you are the [blankety-blank] pleasantest man I ever met! Shake hands, young fellow.
I am glad to see a man that stands up for his convictions&#8221; (See Gospel Doctrine, 518).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I love Joseph F. Smith&#8217;s words: <span style="text-decoration: underline">true blue, through and through</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">For the purpose of our discussion today, will you think of integrity as being <span style="text-decoration: underline">True.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">True Blue,
Through and Through</span>. True to yourself, meaning who you are as a son or daughter of God, and
who you are in the process of becoming. True to others, meaning that you do what you say you
will do. And true to God, meaning that you practice what you preach and that you are doing what
you covenanted to do here in mortality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Living with integrity isn&#8217;t necessarily easy, but it is far easier than the alternative. Integrity
engenders confidence and peace of mind, whereas breaching integrity always has painful
consequences. A case in point:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I was raised on a large grain farm in Kansas, and on a farm you learn to drive as soon as you can
see over the steering wheel and touch the pedals&#8211;preferably at the same time. For me, that was in
the fourth grade. So, by the time I got my driver&#8217;s license at fourteen, I was a seasoned veteran
behind the wheel. Or so I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">That first June after getting my driver&#8217;s license, I was expected to help with harvest. My job was
to drive a grain truck from the field to the elevators, ten miles away via country road. The trip to
the elevator was a straight shot, except for one stop sign to cross a highway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Now, it takes hundreds of yards to grind down through the gears and bring a fully loaded grain
truck to a complete stop. It was a pain for a young girl. Each time I came to that stop sign, I
couldn&#8217;t help but think how much easier it would be if I didn&#8217;t have to completely stop. It&#8217;s not
as though I needed to stop. There was rarely any traffic on that remote highway. And besides,
Kansas is flat. You can stand on a tuna fish can and see forever. So from the cab of the truck, I
could see for miles. After indulging in these thoughts for a few days, I managed to rationalize
that it was actually a good idea if I just slowed down but didn&#8217;t completely stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Which I began to do. And it did make dealing with the stop sign <span style="text-decoration: underline">so much</span> easier. But then
something curious began to happen; and before I knew it, not only was I not stopping, but I
wasn&#8217;t doing much more than taking my foot off the pedal briefly, glancing both ways, and
barreling across the highway. I did this day after day, including one afternoon when I again
disregarded the stop sign, sped across the highway, and proceeded down the dirt country road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Now, I should point out that a heavy truck on a dirt road kicks up a lost of dust. That afternoon,
after going five miles, I looked in the rear-view mirror as I slowed to turn a corner and to my
fourteen-year-old horror saw a white car with a rotating red light on top following me. I had
never even seen a policeman out in the country. And after eating my dust for five miles, he was
not all that cheerful. Then, when he saw how young I was, he demanded to talk with my parents.
So with his red lights still gyrating, he followed me to our farm a mile away. And let&#8217;s just say
that it was a painful experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I learned three things that day: First, that with lightening speed, I went from complete observance
to complete disregard of the law. Second, my demise started with a small crack in my integrity.
The instant I talked myself into taking a small liberty, I was on a slippery slide into full-scale
disobedience. And third, there is no such thing as slightly breaking a law&#8211;whether a law of the
land or a law of God&#8211;because even a slight breach of integrity opens the door for Satan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Helaman&#8217;s stripling warriors stand in stark contrast to my performance behind the wheel of the
grain truck. They performed <i>&#8220;every word of command with exactness&#8221; </i>and<i> &#8220;were <span style="text-decoration: underline">true</span> at all
times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted&#8221; </i>(Alma 57:21; 53:20). In other words, they kept
their covenants with precision. They were true blue, through and through. They clearly
understood that a half-hearted effort to keep the Sabbath day holy or to be morally clean or to tell
the truth is no effort at all. Joseph Smith didn&#8217;t declare that we <span style="text-decoration: underline">usually</span> believe in being &#8220;honest,
true, chaste, benevolent, [and] virtuous&#8221; (Articles of Faith 1:13). On Mount Sinai the Lord didn&#8217;t
say, &#8220;Thou shalt <span style="text-decoration: underline">rarely</span> covet&#8221;; or &#8220;Thou shalt not steal <span style="text-decoration: underline">very often</span>&#8221;; or &#8220;Thou shalt only commit
adultery a time or two.&#8221; He said &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Thou shalt not</span>,&#8221; clearly delineating the line between integrity
and infidelity, a line that when we cross we risk losing control of our thoughts, motives, and
actions. Just as I did in the grain truck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Integrity is the foundational virtue upon which all other virtues are dependant. It is the first rung
on the character ladder. Where there is integrity, other virtues will follow. Where there is no
integrity, other virtues have no chance of developing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Falsehood and breaches of integrity are as old as Cain and Abel. Today there seem to be flagrant
violations of integrity everywhere&#8211;the newsroom, the locker room, the board room, even the
court room. We have endured so many outrageous national scandals that obscene abuses of
power and money seem almost ho-hum. Leaders at the highest levels of government have
committed unspeakable breaches of integrity&#8211;and then lied until forced to confess. Executives in
one corporation after another have bilked investors out of billions. Some have lost fame and
fortune simply because they lied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Four years ago, prior to the last presidential election, I was invited to address an east coast
professional organization on the topic of leadership. The &#8220;gist&#8221; of my message was that true
leaders embodied certain virtues&#8211;with the key virtue being integrity&#8211;because a man or woman
who can&#8217;t be trusted can&#8217;t really lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">After the presentation, an accomplished businesswoman approached me. &#8220;You know,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never thought about the connection between leadership and integrity. But I guess it really is
impossible to lead people if they don&#8217;t trust you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Her reaction stunned me! Who wants to be led by a liar? Tell me, do you care if the professor
who determines your grades is fair? Do you care if your banker is honest? Would you like to
know that your surgeon didn&#8217;t cheat his way through his residency? Do you care if the person
you&#8217;re dating tells you the truth about his life, his past, and his feelings about everything from the
gospel to what kind of family he wants to have?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Of course you do, because it is not possible to develop a relationship, <span style="text-decoration: underline">any</span> relationship&#8211;whether
between husband/wife, parent/child, teacher/student, or business/customer&#8211; with someone you
can&#8217;t trust. There is a reason adultery is referred to as &#8220;cheating,&#8221; because it constitutes such a
cruel breach of trust. And trust, which can only be engendered in an atmosphere of integrity, is
the keystone that holds every organization together&#8211;whether it is a marriage or a family, a
business or a nation, or even the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Prophets ancient and modern have provided patterns to emulate. Consider Joseph, whose rotten
brothers sold him into Egypt and then lied about it. In stark contrast to his brothers, Joseph&#8217;s
integrity held fast under the most trying of circumstances. Consider his words as he resisted the
seductive advances of Potiphar&#8217;s licentious wife:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Behold, my master...hath committed all that he hath to my hand;...neither hath he
kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I
do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</i> (Genesis 39:9).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Joseph was unwilling to betray either his friend or his God. He was true blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Job set an example of integrity for the ages. Even after losing his wealth, his health, and his
family, he declared, <i>&#8220;Till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me. My righteousness I hold
fast, and will not let it go&#8221; </i>(Job 27:4-6).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Then there was Saul, who went about destroying the Church&#8211;until his remarkable conversion.
From that time forward, the Apostle Paul was faithful to his charge to <i>&#8220;bear [the Lord&#8217;s] name
before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel&#8221; </i>(Acts 9:15). He was stoned, persecuted,
arrested, and bound in chains (See Acts 14:19; 21:33). Yet even before King Agrippa, he boldly
declared the truth and was true to what he knew to be true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Prophets in our day have been similarly valiant, beginning with the Prophet Joseph, whose vision
of the Father and the Son consigned him to a lifelong crucible. He was mocked and persecuted,
tarred and feathered, imprisoned for months at a time, and betrayed by trusted friends. Through it
all he declared,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages,
and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for
saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true;...I had seen a vision; I knew it, and
I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it&#8221;</i> (JS-H
1:25).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The Prophet Joseph never backed down. His was stunning integrity under stunning
circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Joseph&#8217;s successors have followed suit. Elder Ezra Taft Benson was an Apostle when President
Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him to serve in his Cabinet as Secretary of Agriculture. For
eight years the press routinely battered Secretary Benson for his policies. But over time, he won
the respect of even his opponents. A reporter for the <span style="text-decoration: underline">New York Times</span> explained why:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>He acts like a man whose conscience is always clear&#8211;his testimony today will be
the same next week...or a year from now. He doesn&#8217;t have to remember what he
said to an opposition Senator at their last meeting. This is a built-in ulcer-saving
device not always found in Washington&#8221; </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">New York Times Magazine</span>, 11 April
1954).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Through it all Elder Benson lived by this statement: <i>&#8220;I feel it is good strategy to stand up for the
right, even when it is unpopular. Perhaps I should say, especially when it is unpopular&#8221; </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ezra
Taft Benson</span>, 373).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">President Gordon B. Hinckley has also been a model of integrity. After he was interviewed by
Mike Wallace for &#8220;60 Minutes,&#8221; I spoke with Mr. Wallace about their interview.  Of the many
things Wallace praised President Hinckley for, he seemed most impressed with the fact that the
prophet had done everything in connection with their interview that he had promised to do. When
I later offered to show Mr. Wallace how I intended to quote him in President Hinckley&#8217;s
biography, he replied, &#8220;That&#8217;s not necessary. You&#8217;re a Mormon. I trust you.&#8221; Do you really think
this hard-hitting veteran journalist believes every member of the Church is trustworthy? Of
course he doesn&#8217;t! He is not that naive. But his statement was not a reflection of me or of us, it
was a reflection of President Hinckley. Wallace was saying, in effect, &#8220;If you are associated with
that man, then I assume that you, too, will do what you have said you will do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Such trust can only be earned one person at a time. Do you do what you say you will do? Can
you keep a confidence? Does your signature on a document or a check or your temple
recommend mean something? <span style="text-decoration: underline">Your word is who you are</span>. No wonder James the Apostle taught
that <i>&#8220;a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways&#8221;</i> (James 1:8).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Indeed, anything that lacks integrity is unstable, as any engineer will tell you. A bridge or
skyscraper that has structural integrity does what it was built to do. It isn&#8217;t necessarily perfect. It
could have flaws. But, under stress and repeated use, it does what it was built to do. If, on the
other hand, a structure does not have structural integrity, it will at some point fail, as was the case
with the world&#8217;s first jet airliner, the British-made de Havilland Comet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">When the Comet was introduced in 1949, the future seemed bright for jet travel&#8211;until three
Comets disintegrated in flight, killing all aboard. The planes were grounded as puzzled engineers
worked feverishly to understand why these planes had operated flawlessly at first, only to later
break apart in mid-air. The engineers set up a fuselage in a large pool and pumped water in and
out, simulating the effects of repeated cabin pressurization. At first, the experiment revealed
nothing. But then it yielded a startling discovery. The repeated stress caused small cracks to form
around the rectangular windows, cracks that soon widened into gaping holes. The planes could
not withstand repeated pressure. They lacked structural integrity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">You and I live in a world <span style="text-decoration: underline">filled</span> with pressure&#8211;pressure to accomplish, pressure to get ahead,
pressure to conform, pressure to be popular. And so on. None of us are perfect. We all have
flaws. How then, under repeated pressure, may we avoid allowing small cracks in our integrity to
form so that we can do what we came here to do? How can we stay true blue&#8211;to ourselves, to
others, and to our Father and His Son?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">May I suggest seven things that will help us become men and women of integrity:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-weight: bold">1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Decide today, once and for all, that you will be worthy of trust</span></span>&#8211;the trust of family and
friends, colleagues and business associates, and most of all, the Lord. The more the Lord trusts
you, the more knowledge and power He will give you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Consider the exquisite promise the Lord made Nephi, son of Helaman: &#8220;Blessed art thou, Nephi,
for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word...unto this
people....Because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness,...I will make thee mighty in
word and in deed,...yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for
thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.&#8221; Nephi had proven himself to the Lord. And
because the Lord could trust him, He increased Nephi&#8217;s access to His knowledge and power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Trust is equally crucial to our relationships here. I have seen marriages crumble because
husbands and wives couldn&#8217;t trust each other&#8217;s word or motives or faithfulness. I have seen
families disintegrate because small cracks in a parent&#8217;s integrity led to gaping emotional and
spiritual holes. I repeat what I said earlier: It is not possible to build a relationship with someone
you can&#8217;t trust. And nowhere is this more evident than in a marriage and family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I know of a couple who struggled for years to build a satisfying relationship, but without success.
The husband had learned to lie when the going got tough, and then lie about lying. His wife, on
the other hand, was so consumed with her desire to be liked and well thought of that she never
discovered who <span style="text-decoration: underline">she</span> was&#8211;rather than who she thought everyone expected her to be. She spent her
time and money doing and buying things to be &#8220;seen of men and women.&#8221; Both husband and
wife were, in their own way, disingenuous. Neither were true to themselves, so their love could
not grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">During the two years I have served as the president of a company, I have gained new appreciation
for how fundamental trust is to every relationship. As I selected individuals to serve as officers in
our company, I found myself asking three questions: Can I trust this person&#8217;s  motives? Can I
trust this person&#8217;s judgment? Can I trust that he or she will tell me the truth? I realized that, while
skills were imperative, integrity was even more so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The Holy Ghost is not able to inspire or endorse the words or actions of someone who is not true
and who can&#8217;t be trusted. So decide now, today, once and for all, that at all cost you will be a
man or woman of integrity who can be trusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">2. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Have faith that the Lord can and will help you, and then diligently seek His help</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Nephi exemplifies this. Repeatedly he was true to the Lord&#8217;s commands, even when they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">seemed implausible. Retrieve the brass plates from Laban? Hunt food with a broken bow? Build
a ship without tools or experience? Yet repeatedly, the &#8220;I-will-go-and-do Nephi&#8221; went and did
(See 1 Nephi 3:7). His response when his brothers called him a &#8220;fool&#8221; for attempting to build a
ship was classic Nephi: <i>&#8220;If the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so many miracles
among the children of men, how is it that he cannot instruct me, that I should build a ship&#8221; </i>(1
Nephi 17: 51). And build a ship he did, because he knew the Lord would help him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Faith is the first principle of the gospel because it is our faith that activates the power of the
Atonement in our lives. If your faith is wobbly, if you&#8217;re not sure the Lord will come to <span style="text-decoration: underline">your</span> aid,
put Him to the test <i>&#8220;Even if ye can only desire to believe, let this desire work in you&#8221; </i>(Alma
32:27). The results will astound you, for God <i>&#8220;worketh by power, according to the faith of the
children of men&#8221; </i>(Moroni 10:7). Challenges that test our faith are almost always opportunities to
strengthen our faith. So believe the Lord will help you, and then diligently seek after His help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-weight: bold">3. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Make covenants and keep them</span>.</span>  In other words, do what you say you will do. This begins
with keeping the covenants you made at baptism and again in the House of the Lord, and then
being precisely, completely true to those covenants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">But it also includes being fair and square with others. Here is a sample checklist: Do you do what
you say you will do, or do you often make excuses for not coming through? Will you rationalize
taking advantage of someone else if it is to <span style="text-decoration: underline">your</span> advantage? Are you doing your own classwork?
Do you give your best effort at work or just put in time? Do you pay a full tithe? Are you <span style="text-decoration: underline">really</span>
living the Honor Code? Would you date your best friend&#8217;s boyfriend behind her back? Are you
honest with those you date, or are you leading someone on because no one better has come along
and you don&#8217;t want to sit home Friday night? Are you straight with your parents about how you
spend their money? If you could improve your chance for graduate school by cheating, would
you do it? What DVDs do you watch and web sites do you visit when you&#8217;re alone? Are you
honest and moral in the dark of night as well as broad daylight? Are you true to those who have
trusted you with their love and confidence? Are you living worthy of the kind of man or woman
you hope to marry, and of the children whom our Father will entrust to your care?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Please understand, I am not asking these questions for my benefit. But I <span style="text-decoration: underline">am</span> inviting you to enroll
today in Integrity 101 and ask <span style="text-decoration: underline">yourself</span> these and other similar questions. Because now is the time
to learn to be precisely honest. Now is the time to commit yourself to a life of integrity. I can
promise that in future days you will face dilemmas far more complex than the ones I have
mentioned, but dilemmas that can almost always be resolved if you are fair and honest and true.
So in your youth, learn wisdom; yea, learn...to keep the commandments of God with exactness
(see Alma 37:35). Learn to be true to every covenant you make.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-weight: bold">4. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Stand up for what you believe</span>. </span>In fact, look for every opportunity to do so. Don&#8217;t be showy
or loud about it, and please don&#8217;t ever criticize or judge others in the process. But relish every
opportunity to stand for something, to be true to what you know is right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Nine days after Heber J. Grant was born, his father died and his widowed mother Rachel was left
to carry on. She tried to support her young son by working as a seamstress and taking in boarders,
but they remained desperately poor. Rachel&#8217;s well-to-do brothers offered her a life of ease if she
would renounce the Church. But she could not bring herself to turn her back on the  gospel. Her
prophet-son later spoke often about the dramatic impact her devotion had on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">It is not possible to denounce who you are, or to live beneath who you are, and be happy. True
happiness comes only when you are living up to who you are. King Benjamin understood this
when he described the <i>&#8220;happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For...they are
blessed in all things&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 2:41).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">If you want to feel <span style="text-decoration: underline">real</span> joy, keep the commandments and be true to who you are. It is actually
easier to stand up for what you believe than to <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> do so. I was reminded of this last summer,
when I was invited to speak about the family to a gathering of United Nations diplomats. I
agonized over what to say to such a diverse group. In the end, I simply explained that my parents
had taught me as a child that personal virtue was essential for a happy marriage and family, and
that in my youth I had promised God that I would live a chaste life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I then acknowledged that, though I had not yet had the chance to marry, I had kept my promise.
&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t always been easy to stay morally clean,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;It has required some self-discipline. But on balance, it has been far easier than the alternative. I have never spent one
second worrying about an unwanted pregnancy or disease. I have never had a moment&#8217;s anguish
because a man used and then discarded me. And when I do marry, I will do so without regret. So
you see,&#8221; I concluded, &#8220;I believe a moral life is actually an easier and a happier life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">&#160;I worried about how such a sophisticated audience would respond to a message about virtue and
abstinence, but to my surprise they leaped to their feet in applause&#8211;not because of me, but
because the Spirit had borne witness of the truth of that message. The happiest people I know are
those who have the integrity to stand up for what they believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-weight: bold">5. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Expect your integrity to be challenged</span>.</span> Metaphorically speaking, be on the lookout for
Potiphar&#8217;s wife. She will show up again and again. Be ready to leave your cloak in her hand and
flee again and again, because Satan won&#8217;t tempt you just once. Moses had to resist Satan&#8217;s
temptations four times. And he had to tell Satan to beat it four times before he finally left&#8211;and
that was after ranting and raving, weeping and wailing, and exposing Moses to the bitterness of
hell (see Moses 1:19-22).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">You too will have to tell Satan to beat it over and over again. Never forget that we are here on
probation. We are here to be tested and to show, by our choices, whether we want to be part of
the Kingdom of God more than we want anything else. Satan knows this. So count on the fact
that your integrity will be tested. It will be tested in ways large and small. This is actually a
blessing, for you don&#8217;t really know what you believe until your beliefs are tested. You don&#8217;t
know if you&#8217;re honest until your honesty is tested. You don&#8217;t know if you really prize chastity
until your virtue is tested. You don&#8217;t know if you can be trusted&#8211;with someone&#8217;s feelings, with
money, with influence, with power&#8211;until your trust is tested. In every trial comes a moment of
truth when you must decide what you really believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">So count on tests of your integrity. But also know that every time we choose to be obedient,
every time we make a tough but righteous choice, our integrity is fortified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-weight: bold">6. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Don&#8217;t give up</span>.</span> This is a lifelong process. I am fifty years old, and I have to work at this every
day. The older I get, and the more determined I become to keep the commandments with
exactness, the more often I find myself seizing the opportunity to repent, ask for forgiveness from
the Lord and others, and then try again. Daily repentance and precise obedience are crucial to
increasing integrity. But then, that is the pattern of life. And when you do something that intro-duces a crack into your integrity, if you are paying attention the Spirit will let you know through
His whisperings and the workings of your conscience that you have something to work on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I was recently in the Midwest when a woman approached me and asked if I was the president of
Deseret Book. When I nodded yes, she handed me a check and with emotion said, &#8220;Years ago I
had a financial setback and could not pay a bill I owed your company. I have felt guilty ever
since. Please take this so that my conscience can be clear again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">No one except the Savior will live a perfect life, and no one is perfected in a day. It takes time
and sheer work to develop and refine our integrity. Heber J. Grant said it this way: <i>&#8220;I know of no
easy formula for success. Persist, persist, PERSIST; work, work, WORK&#8211;is what counts in the
battle of life&#8221; </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings of HJG</span>, p. 36).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">So learn to delight in repenting and obeying. And don&#8217;t give up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-weight: bold">7. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Covenant&#8211;or perhaps I should say, renew your covenant&#8211;with our Father and His Son to
do what you came here to do</span>.</span> For doing what we agreed to do premortally is the ultimate
expression of our integrity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">As in all things, the Savior is the supreme example of perfectly fulfilling His foreordained
mission. Premortally, when our Father outlined His plan and the need for a Redeemer, the Savior
responded, <i>&#8220;Here am I, send me&#8221; </i>(Abraham 3:27).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">He came, lived a sinless life, and at the appointed hour submitted to the agony of Gethsemane.
He didn&#8217;t do it for Himself; He was already a God. He did it for you and me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Perhaps even the Savior didn&#8217;t completely comprehend the depths to which He would be
required to go, for there came that moment of unspeakable anguish when He pleaded, &#8220;Father, if
thou be willing, remove this cup from me.&#8221; But then, in the midst of His agony, He demonstrated
supernal integrity by adding: <i>&#8220;Nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done&#8221;</i> (Luke 22:41-43).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">There was no ram in the thicket this time. The Son of God did what He was sent here to do. His
was the ultimate honoring of a commitment. And it was also an unparalleled example of
something that should give each of us great courage. For at that sublime moment of submission,<i>
&#8220;there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him&#8221;</i> (Luke 22:43). Even the
Savior wasn&#8217;t required to complete His mission alone. And neither are we, if we too honor our
eternal commitments and submit ourselves to God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Later, on the cross, the Savior uttered seven final words: <i>&#8220;It is finished, thy will is done&#8221; </i>(JST
Matthew 27:54). From &#8220;Here am I, send me&#8221; to &#8220;It is finished, thy will is done,&#8221; we have a
pattern of perfect integrity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We too made premortal commitments, among them surely being a willingness to come during
this <i>&#8220;eleventh hour&#8221;</i> (see D&amp;C 33:3). Surely we followed our Elder Brother&#8217;s example. Perhaps
we said something like this: &#8220;If you need someone who will have the courage and determination
to face the world at its worst, here am I, send me. If you need husbands and wives who will be
faithful to each other, raise their children in the admonition of the Lord, and defend the family,
here am I, send me. If you need men and women who will see through the lies of the world about
family and gender and intimacy, and who will never confuse being tolerant of others with
tolerating sin, here am I, send me. If you need men and women who can think straight in a
confused, twisted world, here am I, send me. If you need men and women who will be fearless in
building the kingdom of God, please, here am I, send me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Two weeks ago, President Boyd K. Packer said this:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>The world is spiraling downward at an ever-quickening pace. I am sorry to tell
you that it will not get better. I know of nothing in the history of the Church or in
the history of the world to compare with our present circumstances. Nothing
happened in Sodom and Gomorrah which exceeds the wickedness and depravity
which surrounds us now....The first line of defense&#8211;the home&#8211;is crumbling. Surely
you can see what the adversary is about. We are now exactly where the prophets
warned we would be</i> (Boyd K. Packer, BYU J. Reuben Clark Law Society
Devotional, 28 February 2004).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">My dear young friends, whom I believe to be the best this world has ever seen, you were sent
now because you have everything it takes to deal with the world now. You were put through your
paces premortally. That you are here now speaks to how well you did. You have it in you to not
only withstand the pressures of the last days but to triumph over them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean you are all living up to who you are. Some of you no doubt need to make
course corrections. To help with this, I invite you to undergo the spring cleaning to end all spring
cleanings by enrolling in Integrity 101. Let me outline the coursework. First, take an inventory of
your integrity by asking yourself the kind of questions I listed earlier. Look for cracks that may
have started to form. Be honest with yourself about your past dishonesties. Second, for the next
30 days take time every night to assess how you did that day. Were you true to yourself and to
others? Were you true to God in every situation? See if it makes a difference in what you say,
how you spend your time and money, the decisions you make, and what you repent of. See if it
also makes a difference in how you feel about yourself and your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">And finally, as you become more fully aware of your strengths and weaknesses, turn to the
Savior more frequently and with increasing fervor. Thank our Father for the gift of His Son and
the privilege of repenting. Express your deep desire to live with integrity. And then plead for
help. The Savior has the power to help you change. He has the power to help you turn weakness
into strength. He has the power to make you better than you have ever been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I know that this is true, for I have felt His redeeming and enabling power again and again and
again. May we come to be more true than we have ever been before&#8211;true to ourselves, true to
others, and true to God, with whom we have made sacred covenants. May we be like the Sons of
Helaman&#8211;who were <span style="text-decoration: underline">strict</span> to remember God day in and day out, and who were true at all times to
whatsoever thing with which they had been entrusted. May we be true blue, through and through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In the name of Jesus Christ, 
amen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Much of what I will say here today I have said at other times in other places and with other
words.  I have prayed that the spirit would be with each of us so that we might be inspired to
both receive and act upon these words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Sister Bradford and I are happy to be with you here today. We have traveled all over this world
and have had the opportunity to see how people live.  I can tell you that you are living in a
privileged place.  Maybe some of you have traveled and have seen what we have seen, but if you
have not it would shock you to witness the poverty and the suffering and the  sadness that goes
with it around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The saddest thing we have ever seen however, is not the poverty.  It is that the people do not
know that there is a God in the heaven.  If I were asked what I know that is the most important
and the most glorious and of the most worth to me it would be that I know there is a God in the
heaven.  And so the fact that most people in the world do not know this is the saddest thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We are so very blessed to be where we are. In almost all cases we have enough of what we need. 
Sure, there are some problems in each of our lives but they are mostly minor and are all
mitigated by the fact that most of us know that there is a God in the heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">This truly is a marvelous day.  We have what no other generation has had.  Around us are the
inventions of an educated world.  We can go to the moon.  We can explore the most
microscopic matter.  We have the knowledge to control most physical diseases, we move at
speeds faster than sound. We communicate over great distances with sophisticated systems as
though we were talking face to face. We can say that man is enlightened.  He has books,
television, great institutions where every theory and principle can be taught and learned,
explored and analyzed.  What a glorious time to live.  Man with his wisdom can, it would seem,
conquer all.  Every problem with the earth and man who inhabits it, should be able to be solved
with the superior knowledge and learning that man has achieved in this great generation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Yet never before at any time in the history of this earth has there been so much misery.  Man's
greed and lust has taken him into acts more base than at any period that has preceded us.  Crime
is at an all time high and rising.  We live in a world of murder, prostitution in all its forms,
robbery, terrorism, cheating and corruption, dishonesty, lying, immorality, violence, divorce,
and broken homes, abandonment of wives and children, abuse, filthiness, obscenity, nudity and
pornography, and even the lowest of acts such as abortion and sterilization are common place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">You would think that with all the wisdom of men we could be the happiest of all people, yet
millions live as slaves, burdened, many starving.  Throughout the world and even among us are
the thousands who live from day to day in misery.  There is filth, disease, hunger and the
drudgery of the days work that brings them just enough to live to the next day when they must
repeat what they did the day before without hope of change or improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">As man struggles, he is controlled by borders, searched, numbered, taxed, counted, and
restricted and dominated in his every act. Most inventions are to get gain, most governments
self serving, most unions steal from the members they were organized to protect, and most
advertising is designed to get you to pay the most for the least.  Surely with the knowledge and
wisdom of many, these things should not be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">How is this possible?  What has gone wrong, what is lacking?  How can it be that such a few
control the wealth and subject the masses to such misery and in so doing subject themselves to
live in the stink and filth of the environment they are controlling? What will be the end of all
this?  Will man ever find freedom and happiness?  Will the wisdom of man finally save him
from this condition?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">It is true that each man must gain the knowledge of the things of this world in order to be able to
gain a living for himself and his family.  He must know how things operate and how the laws
that govern them apply. All truth learned by man gives him a stronger base upon which to build
and if he keeps learning and building he can surround himself with security and become
adjusted to the conditions and limits of coexistent law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">It has been said that teaching is the most noble profession.  This is true only of the teacher that
teaches truth.  A person is far from noble who would teach others things that would turn them
from God and lead them into unrighteousness and lives of slavery to Satan.  To be a noble
teacher you must teach truth.  All truth comes from God.  We believe in God the Father, He who
knows all truth.  We believe in God, the Son to whom was delegated all power and control of all
truth as it applies to this earth.  We believe in God, the Holy Ghost, He is God the Witness, God
the Revelator.  From Him we receive knowledge of all truth which is coexistent with God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">There has never been a truth made known to any man on earth except as it was revealed to the
earth by the Authority of God and through the workings of the Holy Ghost. Let me remind you
that there are two kinds of light.  The one we seem to know the most about is light the absence
of darkness.  This is a light that is a product.  It requires the expenditure of energy to produce. 
This product is seen as rays of sunlight or fire light or electric light or in other words a product
that produces the absence of darkness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">There is another kind of light.  It is a communication system.  The great plan of our Father uses
a system to communicate by transferring truth from its source into the minds of those who are of
the species of God.  This system is called the light of the spirit.  When we are using it we are
learning truth.  It is how we learned the things of God before we came to this earth and it is how
we learn the things of God here in mortality. Let me also remind you that we are literally the
spiritual sons and daughters of God the Eternal Father.  We are sired by him.  We are of His
seed.  A seed gives forth of its own kind and species.  If you plant corn, you don&#8217;t get cabbage. 
We are the seed of God.  Because we are His seed, we are in His image and likeness.  Our
minds are like His mind and have the capacity to receive truth from its source by way of the
light of the spirit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">To use the light of the spirit we must be obedient to the laws which govern it usage, which is to
say be righteous.  The Holy Ghost is there to provide the light of the spirit to us if we are
obedient and righteous. Earlier I said that the most important and glorious of all things I have
ever learned is that there is a God in the heavens and that He is literally my Father. I was born
spiritually of Him.  Because of this, the divine nature of God is in me as it is in all of his
children.  To know this is to know that which has the most power to cause  us to strive for that
which is right and to try to live the plan that God, our Father, has given us to allow us to return
to Him and live the magnificent style of life He lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The memory of all this was withheld from us at the time of our mortal birth but we have not
been left without some knowledge of what happened and what is to come.  By way of His
revealed word the Father has taught us that He called us together at a council meeting.  This
took place before the earth was created and thus it is called the pre-mortal council in heaven. 
The purpose of the council meeting was to review what we had learned and to review the plan
for our future progress and to take the next steps in that plan. This required that an earth be
created. An earth upon which the plan could be carried out. There would need to be a creator of
that earth and someone would need to responsible to govern and execute everything having to
do with the plan.  One of the Father&#8217;s sons was willing to be that person on conditions that he
could modify the Fathers plan.  He also wanted honor and glory to himself for doing it. We
know this person to be Lucifer and it has been revealed to us that one third of our Fathers
children followed Lucifer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Another of the Father&#8217;s Sons stood and agreed to do what was necessary. He would follow the
Fathers plan exactly and would give all honor and glory to the Father, whose plan it is. We
know that this is Jesus Christ and that he was chosen by the Father. He was sustained by the
Father. He was also sustained by all of us.  Our being here on the earth is in itself  prima facie
evidence that we sustained Him. Christ took of spirit matter and subjected it to the laws of God
and thus created all the systems and subsystems that make up this earth.  It was worked with
until it obeyed and became independent in that sphere in which it was placed to act for itself.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The Father sent us to this earth and gave us commandments. If we disobeyed these
commandments there would be consequences.   The most serious of these consequences is the
fall which means that we become subject to death.  Death is the separation of our spirit being
from our physical bodies and also the separation of our spirit beings from the presence of our
Father in Heaven. We do not have power in this mortal stage of the plan to overcome the
conditions of death without someone to help us.  In that council meeting I have talked about it
was decided that if there was a fall, this same Jesus Christ would be our Redeemer. He would
do the work necessary to cause our physical bodies to be reunited with our spirit beings and he
would do an enabling work that would allow us take the steps that would lead us back to God
our Father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">He has done that work. He has obeyed the Father.  He has overcome the conditions of the fall. 
He has redeemed us on conditions of our obedience.  I could go on and on talking about what
He did and what He is yet doing.  I could list for you His attributes. I could give lesson after
lesson on His acts.  I could teach you the Father&#8217;s gospel which Christ has provided for us. But
this is an ongoing process, much of which we must do for ourselves.  I hope and pray that we
are all involved in that process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Now, this is Christ&#8217;s work.  He is at the head. In March of 1830, as the work in this dispensation
was just getting underway, Christ revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith the following:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>I am Alpha and Omega, Christ the Lord; yea, even I am he, the beginning</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>and the end, the Redeemer of the world.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>I, having accomplished and finished the will of him whose I am, even</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>the Father, concerning me&#8212;having done this that I might subdue all things</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>unto myself-</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Retaining all power even to the destroying of Satan and his works at the</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>end of the world, and the last 
judgment </i>(D&amp;C19:1-3).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Satan has knowledge of all these things and every time a truth has been revealed he has twisted
and changed it to fit his evil plan and has taught it to everyone that he could. Think of some of
the things you know about that have been changed by Satan.  For example, according to God
what is the most important calling of His Sons?  To be fathers and create honorable and Godlike
families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Satan teaches celibacy, immorality, divorce, birth control, abortion and that marriage is of no
value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">What is God's revealed word about work?  It is that man should be engaged in honest hard work
and should earn by their own labor that which they need to support themselves and families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">What does Satan teach?  That there should be the rich that rule over the poor.  That its all right
to be idle and to steal and take advantage of others by corruption and unrighteous control.  He
teaches that we need all the &#8220;Isms&#8221; that control and subject men.  Promising them welfare but
giving them slavery, offering them social justice, but robbing them of their  agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Yes, teaching is a noble profession but only when one teaches the truths of God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Through all ages of time, man's wisdom has carried him into self-created misery.  In the time of
Noah it brought on the flood.  In Joseph's time, men were slaves to each other and were
burdened and oppressed.  In Moses' day they were driven, and wandered, and their days in a
promised land were short as they were overrun and enslaved by Babylonia. Christ came at a
time when nations were at war and most men paid tribute to conquering Rome who ruled with
greed and at the point of a sword.  Christ was killed as were others who would not submit to the
life style of immorality and slavery to sin and to cruel masters.  The world sank into darkness
where blood and horror reigned.  In the name of God, who men neither knew nor followed, by
the sword, nation conquered nation, greed conquered man and Satan conquered all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Only a few could see light through this darkness and tyranny.  As these few watched carefully
the light increased and showed them the way to become the discoverers of new worlds.  The
reformers, the pilgrims, the framers of constitutions and bill of rights, the inventors, the freedom
winners, the builders of foundations.  Their work has caused great concern to Satan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Could it be that it was not the wisdom of man that was causing Satan to shake and tremble? 
Could it be that something else was needed to bring peace and liberty, order and happiness? 
Surely thinking men can see that the light and truth from God above directed these great men. 
There was no source on earth to draw from.  No man, of himself, knew how to control Satan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">It was not the learning of men that motivated a young boy in those days to seek answers from
God as he knelt in fervent prayer in a secluded grove.  Nor was it from the wisdom of learned
men that he got his answers.  He was told things from the mouth of God that no man knew and
few would afterwards believe, yet the profound truths given to this uneducated youth from on
High had within it the power to roll back the darkness of generations and bring peace and
freedom to the world.  No longer was it necessary for men to live in slavery.  Now man could
know how to rise up out of his filth, how to escape the weight of his burden, how to identify and
forsake sin, how to act as God would have them act in His name, how to be saved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Yet for millions this most glorious of all events has not yet come.  They have not yet seen the
light.  They have not heard the truths.  They have not felt the Spirit that led those brave
reformers and restorers.  They continue on, led from one act of sin and filth to another because
they have not yet seen the light.  They continue seeking their peace in the foolish wisdom of
man.  We are taught be the scriptures:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Let no man deceive himself.  If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this
world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.  For it is written, He
taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And again, the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that </i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>they are vain.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.43in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Therefore, let no man glory in men.  For all things are yours;</i> (I Corinthians
3:18-21).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Now, you who have received the light, &#8220;Let No Man Deceive You.&#8221; Can you not see that it is
you who have the only thing that can free the world? You can lighten the burden, cure the sick,
free the enslaved, you can feed the starving, cleanse the filthy, unite the divided, gather the
abandoned, you can teach the truths and become the light that gives vision and clarity, you can
give hope and the knowledge of God. What could anyone but God do more? God gives men
their salvation. You have the power to lead man to God. You will not do it if all you know and
teach is the foolishness of men. To do so continues the cycle that keeps men bound down under
the burden that Satan has placed upon them from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">There is a supreme, organized Being who governs and controls all truth, both temporal and
spiritual. He is Jesus Christ. True freedom, happiness and success come only as we know Him,
the only wise and true God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Will you not teach Jesus Christ? He is the light, the truth, the only way to freedom and
salvation. Will you not teach Christ in your actions, your spirit and by His word?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">To teach Christ you must understand Him. You must know that He is. You must know that He
is the only way by which happiness comes. You must know Him. Will you not then dedicate
yourselves to that which is above all things most important to you and to the world? The work
of saving souls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">More than a quarter of a century ago He, that is Jesus Christ, by way of His servants, called me
to be an especial witness of Him. And I am that.  Through these years He has been with me. He
has seen to it that I have come to know Him. Thinking back I cannot remember any time in my
life that I didn&#8217;t know that He lived. That is one thing, but it is another thing to know Him. By
the events of my ministry and the power of The Spirit, to a certain degree and level I have come
to know Him. There have been times during this ministry when I have been less than I should
have been. There have been times when the Spirit could not get through to me.  Even then
Christ has inspired others to look after me, to teach and train me and get me moving the right
direction again. To them I owe an eternal debt of gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Any fool can teach the wisdom of men for it is foolishness. It takes men and women of God to
teach the light and truth of God. That you may be these men and women, I pray in the name of
Him whose wisdom has all saving power, even Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Dear Brothers and Sisters, it&#8217;s an honor to speak to you today. I pray for the guidance of the Holy
Ghost to be with me.  I love this great institution and especially you students. I want to thank you
for the radiant light and the happiness you carry with you. I appreciate the way you live the

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Today is April 6th. What does that date mean to you? Our calendars label April 6th as the
Passover. As you remember, the Passover celebration was to commemorate Israel&#8217;s deliverance
from Egyptian bondage. It was a time of feasting and celebration in memory of the fact that the
angel of destruction passed over the homes of the children of Israel in Egypt. It was the Old
Testament festival of springtime. Passover is part of the Christian observance of Easter as we
remember the death and resurrection of our Savior Jesus Christ which we celebrate this Sunday.
The Passover in the scriptures helps us establish a time line of events. It was on the Passover that
Joseph and Mary and the young boy Jesus went to Jerusalem, and if you remember it was then
that his parents left for home and realized that they had left Jesus in town. Did that ever seem
strange to you? It did to me until I had children of my own.  As Mary and Joseph hurried back to
the busy city they found young Jesus among the doctors of the law both hearing them and asking
them questions. As Luke describes: &#8220;<i>all who heard him were astonished at his understanding
and answers.&#8221;</i> The Passover marked significant milestones during the mortal ministry of Christ.
It was during Passover in his ministry that Jesus made his mission known by purifying the temple
when he drove the money changers out.  It was later at the Passover when Jesus manifested his
power by the miracle of the loaves and fishes. Finally, in preparations for the Passover meal in
that upper room Jesus sat down with his disciples and introduced the sacrament and the symbols
and there he stated &#8220;<i>I am the bread of life . . . He that cometh to me shall never hunger and he
that believeth on me shall never thirst. &#8220; </i>Of course, it would be the feast of His last Passover that
would give full expression to this ancient celebration. Matthew records: <i>&#8220;Ye know that after two
days is the feast of the Passover and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.&#8221;</i> Many Gospel
scholars believe that it was on April 6th that the Savior was crucified.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">What other events took place on April 6th? It was on this day in 1830, Tuesday, did you catch
that, Tuesday, April 6th, that six men gathered in humble settings and organized The Church of
Jesus Christ under the laws of the state of New York. Today is the 174th birthday of the
organization of the Church.</span><br />

<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Dear brothers and sisters, I would like to talk to all of you that will soon be graduating or leaving
for the summer and be away from campus. This University is a very special place of learning. I
believe it is as Elder Scott indicated a few months ago as he visited campus,  <i>&#8220;that this
University is a spiritual oasis in a difficult world.&#8221;</i> I often think of it as a Missionary Training
Center to prepare you for the lifetime mission you will be serving in the world. At this school
you can be preparing to go into the world to live, work, and raise a family. You will be going out
into communities, and into wards and small branches in the world to help build the kingdom of
God. What a wonderful time to be on earth with so much knowledge, opportunities and
possibilities but with these blessings comes the responsibility to assist in the spreading and
strengthening of the Gospel on the earth.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If you have been working hard here at school, your academic preparations should be sound and
serve you well as you enter the world of work or transfer to another university to seek advanced
studies. You have been taking courses that have been carefully outlined and prepared by qualified
faculty and administrators. The mission, goals and overall performance of the University are
evaluated regularly by the Northwest Association of Schools to make certain that we meet the
national accreditation standards required to operate as a university. By the way, next week an
inspection team will be visiting campus making sure we are as great as we claim to be. If you
happen to see any of these visitors, please smile and look as smart as possible. If we pass this
difficult inspection process, which we assume we will do very well, the degrees that we grant at
graduation will continue to be recognized by the world of employment and transfer universities.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The religious training that you have received has been outlined by the leaders of the Church with
the scriptures as your text. The lessons taught in those classes by the Spirit and directed by great
gospel teachers should give you a solid spiritual foundation to build on.  By living the Gospel
standards outlined here on campus and participating in your campus wards, your testimonies
should have continued to grow. Your personal prayers should have been strengthened as you
have felt and experienced the guidance and companionship of the Holy Ghost.  I remember Alan
Young, an employee in the Instructional Technology Department on campus, as he bore
testimony to a group of students stating that  &#8220;<i>the most important thing students can learn while
on this campus is to communicate with the Spirit.&#8221;</i> I have thought of that a lot as I have watched
students leave this school and become successful in the world. To have the Spirit with you to
provide you with light and knowledge will be critically important for your success and survival.
Each of you has been blessed with special spiritual gifts and I believe foreordained prior to

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As the internship coordinator for the Architecture and Construction Department, I have the
opportunity to monitor the internships and employment opportunities of many students going out
in the world of work. It is fun for me to introduce our great students to different companies.
Some employers have a difficult time understanding the light and spirit that you students carry
with you. I often hear companies say things like;  &#8220; The students appear so bright and happy.
They look so good.&#8221; I have been asked if you are really all as good as you look.  You might want
to ask yourself that question. One company last month told me that they recruit and interview at
many universities across the nation and that at this school students seem sharper, brighter and
able to communicate better than at many other schools. I have tried to explain a bit what it is like
for our young people in the church to advance through the young men and young women
organizations or to fill full time missions. Most folks just don&#8217;t get it.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Another student had been serving on an internship only a few weeks when his boss called me one
evening and reported that the young man&#8217;s technical skills were poor. I explained that he was a
sophomore and had only been in our program a short time and had little experience. He told me
that he had sent this young man out to assist a crew of carpenters building homes and that the
first day he had cut the saw horses in half and flubbed up most of what he worked on. He said
when they send him for tools or lumber, he typically brought back the wrong things. I then
apologized and asked him if he planned to fire him. He said,  &#8220;Not on your life. If the kid does
nothing but just show up on the job, his positive influence on my crews is worth keeping him
around. The foul language has nearly stopped on every job site he is on. I just called to thank
you.&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Chicago Iron and Steel called some time ago interested in hiring a student to work on a large
industrial construction project in India. I asked him why he would ever call us, a small school in
Rexburg, Idaho. He explained that they needed good honest workers that didn&#8217;t use alcohol, and
could stay morally clean. They were having difficulty with the laws and government officials in
the country because of the poor conduct of their workers and the only person they could depend
on was a member of our Church who had suggested calling us.</span></font></p>

you and says,  &#8220;Where did they come from? I&#8217;ve never had such a person. Why
people just flock around that person. And they want to follow. They don&#8217;t have to
be led; They&#8217;re seeking to go where that person wants to go. And they come up
with new ideas. I don&#8217;t know where that comes from, they seem to find a better
way and the budget doesn&#8217;t go up. I can&#8217;t understand it.&#8221; And I&#8217;ll smile and say, 
&#8220;Well, come with me to Rexburg.&#8221; And I may not be able to show it to you. And I
may not be able to prove it to you. But you&#8217;ll feel it. There will be a spirit here, I

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">You need to understand that there is an expectation of conduct and influence as you prepare to go
out into the world. You must be prepared with a good education but more importantly you must
carry the Spirit and light of the Gospel with you. I think of Christ&#8217;s teachings comparing us to
sheep in the wilderness and being able to hear the voice of the Good Shepherd.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">These are wonderful, loving, religious people that love God, their families, the land and animals
that provide them life. There was a young lady there who was a cousin living there for the
summer who last year was baptized into the Church. While living with these families I couldn&#8217;t
help feeling that these people are part of those that will come forth and be part of the prophesied
gathering in the latter days.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">While living in the Mongolia countryside, I was fascinated with the vastness of the rolling hills
with no fences or barrier of any kind to keep their animals from wandering away. My wife and I
both grew up on the farm with a love for animals. In my youth I spent much of my time trying to
keep our animals fenced in. My father always had a band of sheep so I was especially interested
how the Mongolian people kept track of their herds.  I learned quickly that there is a difference
between being a shepard and being a sheep herder. We were sheep herders, keeping our animals
contained in fences and corrals. Our sheep had little agency as we herded them from fenced area
to fenced area with force and a few sheep dogs. If ever our sheep escaped, they ran wildly
through town. I remember one spring day while in Junior High we suited up in my PE class and
headed out to the soccer field.  I remember clearly trotting out with all of my friends only to stop,
frozen in terror, as I recognized the women in a house dress and apron running across the playing
field, with a broom, chasing four sheep. Yes, it was my mother trying to catch a few of our
escaping critters. I didn&#8217;t know whether to help or hide. I followed along as the entire class
joined in to help Mom get our sheep back home.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Those who cared for the sheep in Mongolia were truly shepherds leading and loving their flocks.
I was amazed that none of the sheep wandered away. The sheep, having full agency, with no
fences to contain them, grazed within sight and the sound of their shepherd&#8217;s voice. Each
afternoon several hundred sheep were called in and gathered into a small meadow area where
they were milked. The sheep were separated by the families that owned them and held together
by a soft camel hair rope, head to head, while they were being milked. These shepherds didn&#8217;t
count their sheep. They knew them. As the sheep were gathered in, I tried to help, but I didn&#8217;t
know which family the sheep belonged to. There were no makings or identifications on them. As
I approached, the sheep were frightened and ran from me. I was touched by the love these
families showed toward the sheep. They spoke to each of them as they stroked the loose wool
from their backs while checking the general health of each animal.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The women do all of the milking, whether sheep, yaks, horses, camels or goats. After milking,
the sheep and goats were lead back to the protection of the Ger as evening darkness approached. 
They instinctively knew that they would be safe and secure sleeping along side the shepherd&#8217;s
Ger.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The shepherds caring for their sheep in the country sides of Mongolia were like those in the
homeland of Jesus. Christ taught often of the relationship that the loving shepherds had for their
sheep. He referred to Himself as the Good Shepherd. Like the sheep left to wonder in the
wilderness, will you be prepared for the challenges you will face in a world that does not
necessarily believe as you do. As the Good Shepherd calls, will you be able and willing to hear
his voice.</span></font></p>

ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.</i></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As the sheep wondered the open hills of Mongolia they carried with them a common, familiar
voice within their hearts, the voice of their shepard. They dared not wander far from this voice in
their daily travels. It was their guide and protection, helping them to find their way home. They
came to know this voice by following their mothers and other sheep until they recognized it on
their own and were willing to follow. For us it is often the same. Many of you followed
wonderful parents that taught you Gospel principles, and testified of the truthfulness of the
Gospel. For some of us, we were introduced later to the Gospel of Jesus Christ as we wandered
in life looking for the truth. The first time we heard the voice or prompting of the Holy Ghost it
had a wonderful, familiar tone. We then felt the Spirit and wanted to follow the Good Shepherd.
As we follow and serve Him we feel of his love and learn to find guidance in that still small
voice within us.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Last semester I made a student cry.  I had just introduced an assignment to the class when I saw a
frighten Rebecca trying to hold back tears.  Much later she told me that the assignment seemed
too overwhelming and that she didn&#8217;t know how she could do it, especially on top of everything
else she was supposed to do.  I wasn&#8217;t trying to make her cry, but as a teacher, I give students
assignments.  I work hard to make the assignments meaningful, challenging, and authentic to the
type of activities they&#8217;ll do in their careers and in life.  I try to prepare students for the
assignments and to help them along the way as they struggle, and I often insist that they work
together with a partner.  I continue to encourage students as they work through the assignments. 
Just as assignments are central to this university, so are assignments central to life&#8212;both on the
temporal and eternal scales.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Imagine the Prophet Joseph Smith&#8217;s reactions to some of his assignments.  Can you imagine as a
college-aged student being told by an angel from God that you will translate an ancient history
from gold plates?  Certainly Joseph has feelings of being unprepared and inadequate for such an
undertaking.  But just as certainly, the angel and our Heavenly Father know that Joseph can do
the assignment with hard work and with help&#8212;help from heaven and help from people.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Joseph works so hard at fulfilling this assignment.  For a while, Joseph, with the help of the Urim
and Thummin, does the translating on his own, but he just isn&#8217;t making much progress.  Emma
begins to help as a scribe, but her daily activities prevent her from helping as much as she wants. 
The Lord tells Joseph that He will send another scribe if Joseph is patient.  In the meantime, the
Lord prepares and directs Oliver Cowdery to assist Joseph.  Imagine the sense of gratitude Joseph
feels when Oliver arrives and offers help with this daunting assignment.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Day after day, the two work on the translation.  One day Joseph receives inspiration through the
Urim and Thummin to send a letter to David Whitmer asking for David to take Joseph and Oliver
from Harmony, Pennsylvania, back to David&#8217;s home to finish the translation in Fayette, New
York, near Palmyra.  David receives the letter, not knowing what to do because he is in the
middle of a big job that needs to be finished before he can leave.  David also has a difficult
assignment he must complete.  He needs two days of heavy work to finish harrowing and
planting the rest of his wheat and then at least another day to spread the much-needed plaster of
paris on his land.  David has at least three days of work ahead of him before he can help Joseph. 
However, David feels he should leave sooner&#8212;a difficult assignment.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The next morning, David goes to the fields to begin his pressing assignment.  At noon, when he
stops for lunch, he discovers to his surprise that he is half finished with the work, and by evening
he has finished the job that would normally take him two days to accomplish.  The next morning
when he goes to the plaster of paris heap to spread it on another field, the pile is gone.  He asks
his sister what has happened to the plaster, and she explains that the day before she and her
children hade watched three men spread plaster in the fields faster than they have ever seen it
done before.  She assumes David has hired the men.  Of course, he has not.  David goes door-to-door trying to determine who has helped him, but no one knows.  David begins to recognize that
he has been receiving heavenly help with his duties at home so he can carry on his assignment to
help Joseph.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">David leaves immediately to help Joseph.  After three days of making good time traveling, David
meets Joseph and Oliver on the road outside Harmony. David is surprised to meet them, but
Oliver explains that Joseph has known the exact time David left Fayette and even where David
has stopped for lunch and watered his horses.  </span>
<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">They return to Harmony for Joseph to say goodbye to Emma who will be following later.  Joseph
prays for guidance about what do to with the gold plates; he receives the answer that he should
give them to an angel who will return them to Joseph when he arrives at the Whitmer farm. 
Joseph gives the plates to an angel before they leave for New York.  On the way they see an aged
man walking along the road with a knapsack that seems heavy on his back.  Joseph tells David to
stop and offer the man a ride in the wagon.  The old man politely refuses and tells them that he is
just going over to Cumorah.  David turns to Joseph confused because he knows the area well and
has never heard of Cumorah.  Joseph explains that the man is a Nephite and in his knapsack are
the gold plates. When David turns to look at the man, he is gone.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When they arrive at the Whitmer farm, the angel returns the plates, and Joseph and Oliver are
able to finish the translation (Turley and Littke 74-78).  Both David and Joseph have received
help from others and help from heaven in fulfilling their individual assignments.</span><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, I know that we don&#8217;t have the assignment to translate the Book of Mormon, but we do
have our own assignments that for us are also significant and essential and so very difficult. 
These assignments pertain to family, church, school, work, and life.  So often these assignments
seem overwhelming and impossible to complete; so often we feel alone and discouraged; so
often we doubt our abilities and our success.  But we are not alone.  Joseph Smith is not alone. 
David Whitmer is not alone.  And my student Rebecca is not alone.  President Hinckley has also
given us the promise:  <i>&#8220;We will not be left alone. . . Pray for guidance and protection of the
Lord.  He will never leave you alone.  He will comfort you.  He will bless and magnify you and
make your reward sweet and beautiful&#8221; </i>(83, 84).</span><br />

assignments they feel inadequate to do.  Imagine the uncertainty and fear Adam and Eve feel as

Laman and Lemuel), from Ishmael and his family, from the Holy Ghost, and from the Liahona. 
Think of the help Nephi receives as he fulfills the assignment to return to Jerusalem to obtain the
brass plates: help at times from his brothers, especially Sam, help from the Holy Ghost, and help
from Zoram.  Think of the help Nephi receives in obtaining food when his bow is broken, help
from his contrite father and from the Holy Ghost.  They receive help&#8212;both physical and spiritual

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Notice that what is happening with Peter frequently is happening with each of us.  We are all on a
sea tossed by contrary, even boisterous, winds and waves with some assignments too difficult for
us to complete on our own.  It&#8217;s night, deep night, and we feel far removed and isolated from
anyone and any type of help.  The wonderful Peter sees his Savior coming toward him walking
on the water.  Following Jesus&#8217;s invitation and assignment to &#8220;Come,&#8221; Peter jumps overboard
and begins to walk on the water towards Jesus.  Peter begins to walk in faith.  Part of the &#8220;not
being alone&#8221; is having the faith to begin the assignment on our own.  Peter is walking on water! 
He&#8217;s soon afraid and begins to sink.  How often are we afraid and begin to sink?  But notice that
when Peter exercises his faith and begins his assignment but then becomes afraid and sinks, Jesus
immediately reaches out to him, holds Peter&#8217;s hand, and catches him just as He catches us.  Jesus
tells us to <i>&#8220;Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.&#8221; </i> We are not alone.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Shannon remembers her feelings of coming here to school.  &#8220;I left my whole family and came
here all by myself.  The homesickness overwhelmed me, and I started to have doubts about if I
really wanted to be here or not.  I have never felt so alone in my life.  I prayed that I would not
feel this way anymore, and the Spirit comforted me by bringing different people into my life.  I
knew that everything would be okay after that.&#8221;</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Heather is here at school alone while her husband is in the military.  She writes, &#8220;I have never
felt so alone as I did at that time. I hadn&#8217;t received a letter from him, and we weren&#8217;t able to talk
on the phone.  One night I started crying and crying.  I just felt so hopeless and lonely.  I just
knew I couldn&#8217;t make it on my own.  So, I prayed, and I really prayed.  I told Heavenly Father all
of my concerns and worries and fears. I prayed for a long time asking if we had made the right
choice and when would things get better.  Suddenly, I felt such peace that we had done the right
thing and this was a trial that would be worth it in the end.  My heart was so warm and I felt like
I had just received a big hug.  It was hard the next few days because I found myself getting back
into my old sadness.  However, I remembered the answer I had received and that gave me peace. 
That answer has stuck with me during the continued hard times.  Because of that answer and
peace, I have not felt such despair and loneliness since.&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Gabriela describes her peace:  &#8220;When my father died, I was very young, and it was very hard for
me. He was my best friend; he was my strength; he was my hero; he was everything to me. 
When I found out what had happened, I felt that I just wanted to run and run and never look back. 
I felt that the world suddenly dropped in my shoulders.  My little brother was scared; my mom
was like a zombie; she was in shock.  I had to be the strong one; I had to be strong for my brother
and my mom.  That night I hugged my brother until he fell asleep, telling him that everything was
going to be all right.  I remember seeing my mom rocking back and forth on a chair, crying
silently, staring at me without seeing me. I kissed her good night and told her how much I loved
her and how much I needed her.  I prayed with all my heart that night; I prayed for my mom, for
my dad.  I asked Heavenly Father to take care of him and to tell him how much I loved him.  I
went to bed and hugged by brother so hard, like I was hoping to squish all the pain away.  In my
heart I wished to sleep so much and not ever wake up to the nightmare that was waiting for me in
the morning.  [But soon, ] I was warm, very warm.  Suddenly all the pain was gone, my heart was
filled with peace and with the assurance of good news, I knew things were going to be all right.  I
knew it was going to be hard, but still I was going to be all right, my brother was going to be fine. 
I felt a love that I have never felt before; I recognized it. This changed the meaning of things.  I
was not alone any more.  I was never alone, and I will never be.&#8221;</span></font></p>

going to watch me go to the prom? Who will see me turn sixteen? Who is going to see me get
married? Who will see my children?&#8217;  I continued to cry until I felt something.  It was my
mother.  She was in that kitchen with me.  I could feel her, I could smell her, but I couldn&#8217;t see
her.  My family noticed it, too.  We gathered together in the kitchen and waited quietly.  One of
us mentioned a funny incident about her, and we laughed.  We soon started talking.  We talked
about the things she did, the things she said, the notes and stories she wrote.  And she was right
there, laughing and smiling with us.  I then heard the answers to my questions: &#8216;I will see you go
to the prom.  I will be there when you turn sixteen.  I will be there in the temple when you are
married.  I will take care of your children until they come to you, and I will see you hold them
and love them.  I will be with you every step of the way.&#8217; I knew I wasn&#8217;t alone.&#8221;</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Levi describes being at end of his first semester of law school when he was diagnosed with an
anxiety disorder.  He was too afraid to speak in class, in church, or even on the phone.  In law
school, professors commonly pick on one student and spend the entire class period drilling that
student on what he is supposed to know, and often, the finals are oral exams.  Levi just couldn&#8217;t
go on.  But with the help of his law school advisor, he withdrew from school for a year to receive
professional help and to force himself to find jobs that would help him such as working at a
phone center calling people and to participate in church by volunteering to read a scripture.  Levi
is back in law school, and he writes: &#8220;The Lord really does watch out for us.  I am so aware of
heavenly help in my life right now.  I feel like I am being lifted up and carried through some
days.  For example, today I was called on in one of my classes.  I started out all right and then got
very nervous and just felt shaky and awful.  When I was finished &#8220;being on the hook&#8221; as we law
students say, I just shook it right off.  I didn&#8217;t hardly even give it a second thought, and I went on
and had a productive day.  I am learning to do this regularly and am able to do it because I ask the
Lord if my performance is acceptable to Him. The answer I am always getting is yes.  I am doing
things that I once doubted that I could do.&#8221;</span></font></p>

bishop called her to be a Relief Society president.  &#8220;Needless to say I was terrified.  However,
something special happened during those first weeks that I&#8217;ll always remember.  My roommate
and I became good friends; however, I didn&#8217;t realize that until one Sunday night.  I was worrying
about who I was going to call into the Relief Society organization.  I was sitting around the table
when my roommate walked up to me and told me not to worry.  She knew that I would be great
at this calling and that I would touch someone&#8217;s life during my eight months as president.  She
lifted my spirits that night.  She later left a note in my room telling me how much she appreciated
me and how much faith she had in me.  I know that if it hadn&#8217;t been for her last year, I would not

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Missionaries also experience that same homesickness and loneliness and uncertainty.  Stephen
writes about being at a branch party in Taiwan at the end of a rough day.  &#8220;Tons of people came. 
Tons of food was served.  But even sitting down among all the food and being surrounded by
people didn&#8217;t ease the feeling of loneliness in my heart.  As a matter of fact, I think it was making
it worse. I missed home.  I missed speaking a language that could easily be understood.  It all
came to a head at this supposedly happy event.  I gave up.  I couldn&#8217;t fight it anymore, and I sat
there just defeated and alone eating my now cold noodles.  A funny thing happened next.  I
looked up with that blank, defeated look on my face and saw Brother Kang.  He turned, looked at
me, smiled, and gave me a tilt of the head.  Despite my desire to give up and conviction that I
wouldn&#8217;t be comforted, I smiled and nodded back.  A thought came into my head, &#8216;Hey, maybe
I&#8217;m not alone.&#8217;  I looked to my right to see members of our little branch all over the big room.  I
knew and loved them all.  They all knew and loved me.  They were my family and surrounded
me in a way that I felt like I was in the middle of a big force field of love, almost like a hen after
having gathered her chicks, would hold them tight in the warm embrace of her wings.  The
Savior had me in His wings that night, and I couldn&#8217;t even get up to get a drink without being
blitzed by warm smiles and the Taiwanese sweet way of sharing their love.&#8221;</span></font></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">And Luke remembers his car breaking down on the freeway as he was returning to Rexburg from
Utah.  The car just stopped and wouldn&#8217;t start.  Other cars didn&#8217;t stop or slow down.  He didn&#8217;t
have a cell phone.  &#8220;My &#8216;gut&#8217; told me to try the car again, and so I did.  It started back up, and I
was able to continue driving to the next exit.  As I was heading into town, the car died
completely next to this nice little home.  I walked to the door and found probably the only pastor
of another church in the entire city.  He invited me in to call a tow truck.  It would take an hour
for the truck to reach me, so he invited me to stay in and even eat dinner with his family.  While
[this experience] wasn&#8217;t truly a life-threatening situation, all the pieces of the puzzle eventually
became manifest and everything worked out fine.  So many times in life, when I don&#8217;t know how
something will work out, the Lord takes care of it, on His timetable.&#8221;</span></font></p>

sealed behind impenetrable walls&#8221; </i>(<i>Ensign</i>, November 2003, p. 80).  Heavenly Father is with us. 
Now, let&#8217;s not forget to recognize the significance and necessity of each of us helping ourselves
and each other. Notice in nearly all of these examples the individuals have been willing to go
forth on their own, have done all that they could do on their own before &#8220;angels&#8221; in the form of
other people or divine help have reached out to help them. Some of the stories you could also
share would include stories of when you have been the one, like David Whitmer, who have been
prepared spiritually or physically to help someone else.  Many of you may have read Sara&#8217;s letter
to the editor in <i>The Scroll</i> describing how she and her friend after attending the temple were
stranded at a gas station without acceptable checks or cash, and a gentle man, a stake patriarch,
and his wife handed them a $20 bill and said, &#8220;Angels come in all different forms, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</span></font></p>

of my favorite quotations by Spencer W. Kimball is on the display wall in the Kimball building,
and it reads, <i>&#8220;God does notice us, and he watches over us.  But it is usually through another

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">Although I was eager to worship in the Nauvoo Temple, I was even more excited to walk down 
Parley Street.  You recall that Parley Street led to the site of the old Nauvoo Ferry, from which 
the early Saints began their exodus from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley.  I had visited Nauvoo 
on other occasions and had wondered what it might have been like to walk down Parley&#160;Street in 
the 1840s&#8212;leaving a temporally and a spiritually secure environment&#8212;and to look back on the 
city and the Nauvoo Temple before crossing the Mississippi River.  Now that the temple was 
finished, I was anxious to have that experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">You may also recall that on June 30, 2002, during the final dedicatory service of the rebuilt
Nauvoo Temple, President Gordon B. Hinckley extended a heartfelt request that those present in
the temple take time upon leaving the service to walk down Parley Street.  He asked that, as they
did so, they think of a young pioneer family and imagine the difficulty of leaving a comfortable
home and departing for an unknown destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">I will never forget what I felt as I walked down Parley Street last summer and looked back at the
temple.  My heart swelled with gratitude and my eyes filled with tears as I thought about those
noble pioneers.  I stood near the bank of the Mississippi River for quite some time and counted
my many blessings and tried to imagine what it would have been like to walk or ferry across the
river into an uncertain future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">In a similar way, today as graduates of BYU-Idaho you stand at the end of Parley Street near the
banks of the river.  You are saying good-bye to what has become for you a well-known and
comfortable environment.  You are not being persecuted or chased out of town as were the early
Saints&#8212;unless, of course, you have accumulated more than 140 credit hours on your transcript! 
But you are stepping into new and uncharted territory.  You likely feel some of the same
apprehensions and concerns as did those Saints who were leaving Nauvoo.  And just as they
pressed forward in faith and were successful, so you will be also.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">Your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ will enable you to triumph in turbulent times.  Your faith in
the Savior will strengthen and protect you.  And your faith in the Lord will empower you to step
into the darkness&#8212;fully knowing and expecting that the light needed to illuminate the pathway
before you will be provided after you have taken the step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">The Prophet Joseph taught that  &#8220;. . .&#160;faith is the assurance which men have of the existence of 
things which they have not seen, and that it is also the principle of action in all intelligent 
beings&#8221; (Lecture 1, pg. 31 in <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Lectures On Faith In Historical Perspective</span>,  Brigham Young 
University: Religious Studies Center, 1990).   Thus, faith is always the beginning or origin of 
action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">Consider faith in Christ as a principle of action in the episode involving the children of Israel as 
they were transporting the ark of the covenant under the leadership of Joshua.  This story of faith 
is found in the third chapter of the book of Joshua.  The Israelites came to the River&#160;Jordan and 
were promised that the waters would part, or &#8220;stand upon an heap&#8221; as described in verse 13, and 
that they would be able to cross over on dry ground.  Interestingly, the waters did not part as the 
children of Israel stood on the banks of the river and waited for something to happen; rather, the 
soles of their feet were wet before the water was parted.  The faith of the Israelites was 
manifested in the fact that they walked into the water <span style="font-weight: bold">before</span> it parted.  They walked into the 
River Jordan with a future-facing assurance of things hoped for.  As the Israelites moved 
forward, the water parted; and as they crossed over on dry land, they also were able to look back 
and behold the evidence of things not seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">As you step into the future and encounter inevitable uncertainties, remember that faith is the
assurance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.  As President Boyd K. Packer
has taught:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">Faith, to be faith, must center around something that is not known.  Faith, 
to be faith, must go beyond that for which there is confirming evidence.  Faith, to 
be faith, must go into the unknown.  Faith, to be faith, must walk to the edge of 
the light, and then a few steps into the darkness.  If everything has to be known, if 
everything has to be explained, if everything has to be certified, then there is no 
need for faith.  Indeed, there is no room for it.  (Elder Boyd K. Packer, <i>What is 
Faith?</i>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Faith</span> (Deseret Book Co., 1983), pg. 42)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">Many of you students will remember the counsel given specifically to you by President Hinckley
in October of 2002:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">You don&#8217;t have to be a genius.  You don&#8217;t have to be a straight-A student.  
You just have to do your very best with all the capability you have.  You have to 
do your very best.  And somehow, if you do that, God will open the way before 
you and the sun will shine, and your lives will be fruitful and you will accomplish 
great good in the world in which you take a part.  (Dedication of the Gordon B. 
Hinckley Building, 22 October 2002, Brigham Young University-Idaho)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">I likewise testify that as you press forward with faith, God will open the way before you, and the
sun will shine upon you, and you will be fruitful and accomplish great good.  On your journey
appropriately seek for the spiritual gifts that will assist and sustain you.  Seek particularly for the
gift of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">I would now like to conclude on a personal note.  Sister Bednar and I love you.  We have so
much enjoyed visiting with you on campus and in your apartments, participating with you in
home evenings, talking about your challenges and opportunities, answering your questions, and
becoming better acquainted.  We will miss you.  And we would love to hear from you; please be
sure to let us know about the things that are happening in your lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">Today you graduates become official alumni of BYU-Idaho, and you now have the responsibility
to help the world better understand who we are and what we do at this institution.  You have
been called to assist in fulfilling the prophesies about this remarkable university.  How you live,
what you do, and what you become will ultimately define Brigham Young University-Idaho. 
May the Lord bless you as you always remember Him and serve Him with faith and with
diligence and with devotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">As our sons have left our home for college and on missions, Sister Bednar and I have shared with
them the following counsel:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8226;<span>&#160;</span>Remember that you represent the Savior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8226;<span>&#160;</span>Remember that you represent your family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8226;<span>&#160;</span>Remember that you represent The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">And as you now are leaving Brigham Young University-Idaho, may I add one more item to the 
list?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8226;<span>&#160;</span>Remember that you represent Brigham Young University-Idaho.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">We love you.  We pray for God&#8217;s choicest blessings to be upon you.  I declare my witness that
Jesus is the Christ.  I further testify that the fullness of the gospel has been restored to the earth
in these latter days.  I so witness and testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">April 24, 2004</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Elder M. Russell Ballard</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">This is a great day for you graduates here on the BYU-Idaho campus. I know this is a time of
excitement and perhaps some nervousness for you as you now must contemplate the
opportunities and the challenges which lie ahead. One thing I am sure of is that your hearts must
be full today with deep appreciation for the outstanding faculty and staff of this university. This
is a special place led by special people. I am also quite sure that today, especially, you feel great
love for your parents and, if you are married, your spouses for their help and support in reaching
this day of graduation.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">As some of you may know, both of my grandfathers served in the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles. My grandfather Hyrum Mack Smith died before I was born, and my Grandfather
Ballard died when I was just ten years of age. President Packer&#8217;s account in his conference
address of his small grandson calling him, &#8220;Grandpa, Grandpa,&#8221; and throwing his arms around
the President&#8217;s legs, brought back a memory of my Grandfather Ballard. On my eighth birthday,
he took me to the Rialto Theater to see a movie. I remember that as soon as the lights went off in
the theater and the film came up on the screen, Grandfather fell fast asleep. He slept rather
noisily right on through the feature film and the cartoons. When the film started over the second
time, I woke him up. He took hold of my hand and out of the theater we went. I recall thinking to
myself, &#8220;How is it possible that anyone could sleep through such a good movie?&#8221; Years later,
when my family took me to see Star Wars, when the lights went out, I fell fast asleep. My
children could not believe it. However, I realized then that when the lights go out, General
Authorities will soon fall fast asleep. This is one of our occupational hazards. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">My father was with my grandfather in the hospital just prior to his death. He told me that
Grandfather pushed himself up in his bed, looked about the room as though he were addressing a
congregation and said, &#8220;And above all else, brethren, let us think straight.&#8221; Then he died, and his
spirit passed to the other side of the veil. Those last words spoken in mortality by Grandfather
Ballard are prominently displayed on one of the walls in my office as a constant reminder to me
to always strive to &#8220;think straight.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">You graduates have completed many classes on many subjects to earn your degree. You now
step away from school into a world that desperately needs people who can &#8220;think straight&#8221; You
may ask, How does one learn to &#8220;think straight?&#8221; The book of Proverbs has a guide that is
helpful. It is found in the 19th chapter, 20th verse: <i>&#8220;Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that
thou mayest be wise.&#8221; </i>In my experience I have learned that straight thinking generally begins
with straight and careful listening. The most important thing we must listen for is the prompting
of the Spirit. The Spirit will be your companion if you are worthy and will help you make wise
and righteous choices. Those with whom I have associated who are most successful in life are
straight thinkers. And as I have come to know, straight thinking is always preceded by good
listening.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">The Nephite prophet Lehi counseled his sons in words that are particularly appropriate for you as
you graduate today and begin a new phase of your lives. He said:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><i>And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of 
men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have 
become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be 
acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, 
according to the commandments which God hath given.</i></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them 
which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal 
life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, 
according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men 
might be miserable like unto himself.</i></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><i>And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken 
unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal 
life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit </i>(2 Nephi 2:26-28).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">When we contemplate the great plan of happiness that our Heavenly Father has given to us to
live by, we understand that agency and freedom to choose are essential to our eternal progress.
So important is our agency that our Heavenly Father was unwilling to intercede and to stop His
spirit children from exercising that agency in the pre-mortal world. We fully understood what
our options were in the grand council in Heaven. We knew that Lucifer&#8217;s plan would eliminate
our freedom and the agency to act for ourselves. We knew that our Father&#8217;s plan of salvation
required that His children face good and evil in mortality and that we would have our agency to
choose between them. We understood the Savior&#8217;s role in God&#8217;s eternal plan. I believe that one
of the most important times in our eternal lives that required us to &#8220;think straight&#8221; was when we
chose to follow our Father&#8217;s plan, led by His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. The privilege
of coming to earth and receiving a body of flesh and bone and continuing our eternal journey
would require us to choose to keep the commandments and follow the Lord and to shun the
enticements of Lucifer. We receive the gift of the Holy Ghost to aid us through life&#8217;s journey.
There is safety in listening to and heeding the promptings of the Spirit.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">There is no question in my mind that we understood the importance of agency. In fact, we were
so excited about the privilege of coming here to receive a body of flesh and bone that the
prophets teach us that we shouted for joy for this opportunity. The reason we did is because we
understood that we could not become like our Heavenly Father unless we experienced mortal
life.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Now we know through the Book of Mormon that <i>&#8220;the natural man is an enemy to God, and has
been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the
Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of
Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing
to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to
his father&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 3:19).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">The test for us, then, is can we develop enough spiritual strength to overcome the temptations of
the flesh? Can we learn to &#8220;think straight&#8221; and set our lives on the course that will allow us to
enjoy all of the blessings of God&#8217;s great plan of happiness?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Seventy-five years ago, I came here. Some of you left your heavenly home in the spirit world
only 20 years ago or so. You haven&#8217;t been here very long. But I hope you have been here long
enough to know that the power of the Lord and the influence of the devil that were in existence
in the pre-mortal world are in full operation here today. Lucifer has not given up. He has not
gone off into a corner to hide himself. Rather, he and his billions of followers are very much in
the business of trying to do everything they know how to draw the sons and daughters of God
away from the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">When Lucifer was cast out of the Lord&#8217;s presence, he was called <i>&#8220;the father of all lies&#8221;</i> (Moses
4:4). That is exactly what he is. He is not interested one bit in your welfare. In fact, his greatest
desire is to confuse your capacity to &#8220;think straight.&#8221; But each one of you has a good mind, and
God has given you the freedom and the agency to decide for yourself what you will do with your
life. You have a great destiny. Each of you has an eternal destiny as a son or daughter of God. He
loves you. Our eternal destiny depends upon our ability to &#8220;think straight&#8221; in the choices we
make. No wonder Helaman gave as one of his last messages to his sons this counsel:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, 
who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation that when the 
devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when 
all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over 
you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock 
upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men 
build they cannot fall</i> (Helaman 5:12).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Now, my dear young friends, stay close to the Lord. Study the scriptures, say your daily prayers.<i>
&#8220;Seek. . . first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added
unto you&#8221;</i> (Matthew 6:33). The leaders of the Church have counseled the members of the Church
about this from the beginning of the Restoration. Never forget that in the scriptures are found the
words of the Lord. In the scriptures are found the way of life, the principles of happiness that our
Father has for His children.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">If we get lazy and decide that we do not need to study the scriptures and say our prayers every
day, that is a bad choice. I believe you will not study anything that is remotely as important as
what you will learn in the standard works of the Church. The principles they teach give you the
guidelines to help you &#8220;think straight&#8221; in making right and positive decisions all the days of your
life.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Some years ago one of my missionaries came to visit me. He said, &#8220;President, I am in trouble. I
think I am losing my testimony of the gospel.&#8221; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">I asked this fine elder how that could be possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for the first time in my life I have been reading some of the literature written by
the enemies of the Church. I have many questions, and I am worried about my feelings for the
Church.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">As we talked further, I learned that he had visited with his bishop and his stake president; but he
still had many questions. I said, &#8220;All right, Elder, give me the list of your questions.&#8221; I told him I
wanted one week to prepare the answers to his questions. It seemed as though I had lifted a great
weight off of his shoulders when he realized that I was going to respond to the anti-Mormon
attacks against the Church.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">As he was about to leave my office, the Spirit prompted me to say, &#8220;Elder, I have one question
before you leave. How long has it been since you have read from the Book of Mormon?&#8221; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">His eyes dropped to the floor. He finally looked back and said, &#8220;President, it has been a long
time.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">I responded, &#8220;Elder, I will answer your questions, but I want you to do something for me.
Promise me that you will read for one hour every day from the Book of Mormon. Will you do
that?&#8221; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;Yes, sir, President, I will keep that promise.&#8221; And he left.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">I asked, &#8220;Why is that, Elder?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;I have kept my promise. I have read from the Book of Mormon; and, President, I know Joseph
Smith is a prophet of God. I know the Book of Mormon is true. I am not worried about my
questions any more.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Now, what is the Lesson? If we are to &#8220;think straight&#8221; as we use our agency to make choices in
life, we must be willing to give equal time to the Lord. You will never have difficulty with your
testimony, you will never be challenged beyond your ability to resist temptations, if you will
give equal time to the Lord through your prayerful study of the scriptures.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">We are living in a day and a time when we must be spiritually anchored. You and I must be
anchored to the Lord Jesus Christ. We also must be anchored to the divine truths that have been
restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">In our quest to think clearly and find answers through our prayers, we will need to follow the
counsel the Lord gave to Oliver Cowdery:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto 
you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind: then you must 
ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn 
within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right (Doctrine and Covenants 9:7-8).</i></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">My dear young brothers and sisters, may our Heavenly Father bless you with the desire to
cultivate in your lives the capacity to &#8220;think straight.&#8221; Remember that straight thinkers do not
make serious mistakes in life. They do not have moral problems. They do not have problems
with the Word of Wisdom. They do not have problems in paying tithing. They do not have
problems in following the counsel of the leaders of the Church. As you master the ability to
&#8220;think straight,&#8221; study and pray, the Lord will bless you in your vocation, your family, and in
your Church service.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">True understanding, peace and a feeling of eternal security will be yours because you know that
you are part of a divine plan designed by our Heavenly Father who loves you. When you
understand this truth, then you will not be pressured to compete for worldly position or acclaim.
Rather you will seek spiritual strength and an eternal assurance. Of course, you will work hard to
provide for your families and do the best you can with the talents God has given to you. But
when you consider the unique perspective for eternity that the gospel provides, you will know
that fame and popularity aren't nearly as important as loving and being loved; status doesn't
mean much when compared to service; and acquiring spiritual knowledge is infinitely more
meaningful than acquiring the things of this world.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Always remember that when our time comes to return to our Heavenly Father to give Him an
accounting of our stewardship while here on the earth, I believe He will be pleased with all of
our honorable accomplishments. I also believe that He will have a special interest in the service-including sharing the gospel-that we have rendered to our family, His Church, and others of His
children along the way.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">I testify to you that I know that God is our Father and that Jesus Christ is His Beloved Son. He
lives and today directs the leaders of His church. This knowledge has been my best guide all of
my life. I pray for the continued blessing of &#8220;thinking straight&#8221; for you and for me, in the name
of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">It is an honor for me to be attending another BYU-Idaho Commencement.  This is a great
institution and it is always a pleasure to be here.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I would like to share a few brief comments this morning about giving.  Generally at a graduation, 
someone encourages you - now as part of the vast alumni group - to contribute financially back 
to the institution in order to continue the educational opportunities you have participated in so 
fully while attending this wonderful university.  That is not the kind of giving I refer to.  Elder 
Marvin J. Ashton once encouraged us by saying, <i>&#8220;Be involved.  Don&#8217;t simply give - give of 
yourself&#8221;</i> (Ensign, May 1974, 36).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Over the years as our older teenaged children became very busy with school, work, Church, and
social activities, time was limited.  It was hard for them to see the value of being involved in
certain things, like attending Mutual every week or taking care of family responsibilities or some
other assignments.  They would occasionally say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go because I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll
get anything out of it.&#8221;  Their wise mother would reply, &#8220;You don&#8217;t always go for what you will
get, but you can always go for what you can give!&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">BYU-Idaho is such a great place to be; some of you may not want to go.  The environment here
is conducive to living the gospel and being obedient.  It is a place where you have been nurtured
and strengthened by the Spirit.  You are comfortable here and may feel like you want to stay. 
(On the other hand, you have just survived another round of finals; you may be thinking, I can
hardly wait to get out of here!)  When I graduated from college many years ago, President
Monson spoke to us.  Paraphrasing his message, I would say, we are glad you chose BYU-Idaho
to get an education.  We hope you have had a wonderful experience being here.  But now that
you are graduating, go!  You are ready to go and make a contribution.  Go for what you can give. 
You are the leavening that will leaven the whole world.  You are needed out there. (No pun
intended.)</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">As a student here you have been given a great deal.  You have received new knowledge, skills, 
and experiences to prepare you for your future.  You have gained friends and developed 
relationships that will benefit you throughout your life.  Some of you may have even gained an 
eternal companion while you have been here.  The real value of your education, however, is not 
what you have been able to get, but what you will now be able to give.  </span></p>

</p>
<p>President and Sister Bednar, faculty, staff, and students, how wonderful you are and how
honored and grateful I am to have the opportunity to address you.  It&#8217;s a unique opportunity.  I
have been told by my colleagues that have been here preceding me to expect a special spirit here,
and I agree.  There is a very special spirit, a spirit of eagerness, a spirit of wanting to learn, a
spirit of keeping the commandments and obeying the Lord and following the directions of our
prophet, and I commend you for it.</p>
<p>In everyone&#8217;s life, there are defining moments that mold and shape and direct their lives. 
These defining moments are divinely inspired and come from God by the promptings of the Holy
Spirit, the Comforter, the Holy Ghost.  In Job 32:8 it says: <i>&#8220;There is a spirit in man: and the
inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.&#8221;</i>  John 10:27 says 
		<i>&#8220;My sheep hear my
voice, and I know them, and they follow me.&#8221;</i>  That&#8217;s the spirit I feel here today, and that&#8217;s the
subject I&#8217;d like to discuss.</p>
<p>May I share with you some of the defining moments of my life to introduce my subject 
today?  A question that students often ask us is: Where did you meet your wife?  Well, I met my
dear wife Kay in Mrs. Munk&#8217;s first grade class, Plymouth Elementary, in Taylorsville, Utah,
over 60 years ago.  I was making a sand castle in the back of the room during recess when she
and her friend Sheri came up and knock it over.  I got mad and I threw sand in their eyes and
their face and their hair.  And I got to meet her - and I got to meet her mother, and I got to meet
the principal, and I got to stand in the corner while she went home and cleaned up.  But when she
came back and saw me still standing there (awfully embarrassed I might add), she went up and
asked Mrs. Munk if I could please sit down, that she was all right now.  And so I got to return to
my seat.  Whew, I knew she was the girl for me.  She&#8217;s been keeping me out of trouble ever
since.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t date much until high school, and we didn&#8217;t date much then because I had a
coach, a football coach, that we nicknamed &#8220;Nosey Edwards.&#8221;  He achieved a little famed in a
school down south in Provo and they even named a stadium after him.  Coach Edwards was my
high school coach and he didn&#8217;t like us talking to girls.  If he saw us talking to girls on the
Granite High School campus, we had to do ten more laps around the stadium track that night,
and you can tell I don&#8217;t like to do laps.  But my friends all dated her and told me what a
wonderful date she was, and so when I did finally take her out I was very pleased.  Graduation
came and I went off to college at Utah State to major in aeronautics and she stayed home and
worked and dated all the returned missionaries that came back to our little town.  That worried
me greatly.  One night, on a Sunday night, as I had come home on the weekend to spend time
with my family and of course my girlfriend, it was a winter night in my freshman year.  The
snow had started to fall about ten o&#8217;clock, and I was worried about driving back the two hours to
Logan and going through Sardine Canyon with a snow storm, and so I was in a rush to get ready. 
I had spent a little too much time saying goodnight I think, and I was in a rush to get back to 
school.  As I rushed around the home collecting my freshly pressed clothing and a cake that my
mother had baked, my father said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s have family prayer before you go back, son.&#8221;  Oh, no. 
He prayed forever, and I thought &#8220;I don&#8217;t have the time,&#8221; but dutifully, as a good son would, I
went in and knelt at the foot of the bed, and he asked me to pray.  Well, I was relieved, because I
thought, &#8220;Well, this is going to be over faster than I thought!  I&#8217;ll be on my way shortly!&#8221;  And
I&#8217;m afraid my prayer was just that - a short prayer, and meaningless.  Afterwards, my mother
kissed me as she always did, helped me with my clothing as I loaded it into the car, and I turned
around and there was my father, walking me to the car, which he never did.  I knew I&#8217;d said a
rather poor prayer, but I knew ever more when he grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me
around and said, &#8220;Son, do you prayer every night, and every morning?&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;Well, just
about, Dad.  Whenever there is a test or an athletic event or something, or if I&#8217;m sick.&#8221;  And he
looked me straight in the eye and said, &#8220;Son, promise me that you&#8217;ll pray night and morning, on
your knees, out loud, thanking the Lord for the many blessings you have, and pleading with him
to direct your life, and to direct you in the paths of righteousness.&#8221;  I promised him I would, and
he gave me a brief hug.  As I drove back to school that night, I thought a lot about prayer, and
the defining moments of my life.  You see that was a defining moment, too, because that week
my father died, and those were the last words that I heard from his mortal lips.  I think if I were
to leave any last words to my son, they would be the same: to pray continually.  My advice to
you is the same.</p>
<p>You know, in order to effectively find our eternal mate and raise a fine family and pursue
a worthy career, to lead and serve and sacrifice in this church and in life, and to enjoy a full and
satisfying life, it takes something more than handbooks and teaching and directions, attendance
at class and uplifting messages; it takes the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, active in our lives, to be
the type of people and leaders and parents and spouses that the Lord deserves and requires of us. 
We are frequently given administrative direction and timely counsel, and we often hear uplifting
messages of Gospel principles and our challenge to carry on our work effectively.  But somehow
we forget these things in time, therefore we must learn and practice being spiritually self-reliant
and understanding life&#8217;s defining moments.  Only the Holy Spirit can be present in every minute,
in every day of our lives, always there as our constant companion, to help us and to refine us and
to bring <i>&#8220;all things to [our] remembrance,&#8221;</i> as it says in John 14:26, and somehow make us
worthy of the Lord&#8217;s choicest blessings.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve had many defining moments in my life.  I remember my sophomore year at
Utah State.  I&#8217;d been a rather good student in my freshman year, all As and Bs, except for one C,
and that was in math.  I struggled in math.  Anybody struggle in math?  You know what it&#8217;s like. 
My sophomore year I thought, well, I&#8217;m going to enjoy college a little bit, and I joined a
fraternity.  I thought I was going to be Joe College.  I gave up studying in the wee hours if the
night, and I did a lot of things on the cuff.  I wasn&#8217;t too proud of that.  I made the Dean&#8217;s list that
fall, but it wasn&#8217;t the honor roll.  It was the probation list.  I&#8217;m not proud to admit that, but I&#8217;ve
overcome that and repented of it, so I can tell you.  It was rather traumatic, and I was struggling
with life, not even knowing it, when I received in the mail one day at school a little penny
postcard, as we called them in those days, a 3x5 card, with a poem on it from my mother.  The
poem was by Margaret Griffiths and it was called &#8220;My Mother&#8217;s Words.&#8221;  May I recite it to you?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Did you know that your soul is of my soul</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Such part, that you seem to be fiber and core of my heart.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>None other can please me, as you, Son, can do.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>None other can pain me or grieve me as you.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Remember the world will be quick with its blame</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If shadow or doubt ever darkens our name.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Like Mother like Son, the saying so true</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The world will judge largely of Mother by you.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>So this be your task, if task it may be,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>To force this proud world to pay homage to me</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And so they will say when my life&#8217;s work is done,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;She reaps as she sows, this man is her Son.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I read it over about ten times as I walked to school, and had it memorized, and I&#8217;ve never
forgotten it.  I&#8217;ve always tried to live to make my mother and my dear sweetheart proud of me.  I
would admonish you to do the same.  It will make your life worthy of the blessings you&#8217;ll
receive.  Yes, that was a defining moment.  I&#8217;m sure my mother was prompted by the Holy Spirit
to send this lovely poem that she clipped out of a newspaper, and thought it applied to us.</p>
<p>I had some other experiences that year, too, that I am not too proud of, but will admit to
you by way of teaching by example, maybe the example of overcoming.  As part of being Joe
Fraternity on campus, I was invited one evening to go up the canyon with a bunch of senior
active members of my fraternity to a beer bust.  I&#8217;d never been to a beer bust and was kind of
curious, assuming they would have soft drinks for us Mormon boys.  Wrong assumption.  I was
persuaded by these active members that I thought a lot of to have a beer or two.  I&#8217;d had more
than two.  I had three to five and became sick.  They drove me back home to the fraternity house
and I went down to my little hovel of a room and immediately threw up on the floor.  As I tried
to clean it up, there appeared at the door the president of the fraternity, Ross Bradford.  Ross
said, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on in here, Skunk?&#8221;  (I was a pledge to the fraternity and they were called
skunks.  I think I smelled worse than a skunk that night.)  &#8220;What&#8217;s going on in here, Skunk?&#8221; he
said, and I told him I was sick.  He said, &#8220;Have you been drinking?&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;Just two or
three.&#8221;  And he said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it.  You were raised in a better family than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross was an experienced man.  He had been in the Air Force for three years, was
finishing school on the GI bill, and I admired him greatly.  He helped me clean up the mess on
the floor, which I thought was very charitable for the president of the fraternity, and then he led
me down the hall to the furnace room.  He opened up the door to this dingy hot furnace room,
and there was an old dirty mattress in there.  He said, &#8220;You go in there and sleep there tonight,
and take this garbage can, and if you get sick again, throw up in that.  I don&#8217;t want to clean up
any more.&#8221;  Well, I felt rightfully challenged and criticized as well, and I sat there for a few
minutes with my head in my hands, rather sick and ill.  He came back, and he had the pledge
manual in his hand, and he said, &#8220;I have a poem I want you to memorize, and if you can
memorize this by tomorrow morning by the time I go to class and have breakfast in the chapter
room, then you can stay and become a member of this fraternity.  If you can&#8217;t, pack your bags
and leave.&#8221;  Well, I stayed up all night, memorizing that poem.  It was a defining moment of my
life.  The poem was called &#8220;The True Gentleman.&#8221;  The next morning I was awake (I had stayed
up all night) and I showered and shaved and cleaned up and even put on my best suit and tie,
shined my shoes, and when Ross came down to his breakfast table, at the head of the table in the
chapter room, I was ready to give  him my poem, &#8220;The True Gentleman.&#8221;  He slowly ate
breakfast while I fidgeted, standing there at attention, and when he finished, he put his napkin
and spoon down and said, &#8220;All right, let&#8217;s hear it.&#8221;  And I quoted this poem called &#8220;The True
Gentleman&#8221;:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The True Gentleman&#8217;s a man whose conduct proceeds</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>From good will and an acute sense of propriety</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And whose self control is equal to all emergencies</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The obscure man of his obscurity, nor any man of his inferiority or deformity</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Who is himself humble if necessity compels him to humble another</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power nor boast of his own
possessions or achievements</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Who speaks with frankness, but always with sincerity and sympathy</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And whose deed follows his word.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>A man who appears well in any company</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>A man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.</i></p>
<p>When I finished, Ross stood up and embraced me, and said, &#8220;Nice job, Skunk, you can
stay,&#8221; and off he went to school.  Before he left, he turned at the door and said, &#8220;The real
challenge is: Now try to live it.  Try to live it.  Try to be a true gentleman in all that you do.&#8221; 
Well, I&#8217;ve found you can live it if you hale to the promptings of the Holy Ghost, if you hale to
the power and influence of the priesthood in your lives, if you follow the commandments of God,
if you follow the directions of your parents and friends and family.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about the Holy Ghost, the Comforter.  What&#8217;s a good definition anyway?  If
we search the scriptures and writings of church leaders, we find that the Holy Ghost is a
revelator, a reminder, an enlightener, an inspirer, a teacher, a testifier, a companion, a comforter,
a strengthener.  He is pure intelligence, light and truth, gentle and calm and amiable and sweet,
temperate and kind, orderly, inspires confidence and love He brings comfort, warmth and
happiness, joy and peace.  He is a persuader, he buildeth up, he is positive and uplifting and
always affirmative.  He is indeed the Spirit of the Lord.  The Lord loves you and will give you
direction and comfort through the spirit of the Holy Ghost (Doctrine and Covenants 3,11, and
13).</p>
<p>Now, how can we each become more spiritually self-reliant? How can we each enjoy the
sweet peace and knowledge and understanding that the Spirit can bring?  How can we be more
aware of the promptings of the Holy Spirit?  How can we learn to recognize life&#8217;s defining
moments?  They&#8217;ll happen to you, I&#8217;m sure, as they&#8217;ve happened to me.  Let me tell you one
other before I proceed.</p>
<p>After Kay and I were married, we graduated and went off to piolet training, then to
Vietnam, then back home to Hill Air Force Base.  We had a daughter and three sons, and then
Kay couldn&#8217;t have any more children.  Her patriarchal blessing had told her that she would have
sons and daughters, and mine told me that I would have a large posterity that which would call
my name blessed.  We worried a little about not having another daughter, but the Lord knew
what was in store for us.  In 1970 I was called as a Bishop.  I was a young man in my early 30s.  
It was an awesome responsibility.  I had a clerk named Don who was an outdoors man.  He loved
to hunt and fish, and on his 40<sup>th</sup> birthday he invited me, his bishop, to go fishing with him.  I did
and I loved it.  It was a wonderful day, but at the end of the day, while we were hiking out, Don
had a heart attack.  We got him to the hospital, but he passed away.  I was the last one with him
when he told me &#8220;Please take care of my wife and children.&#8221;  He had a wonderful wife and four
little girls.  Three months later, his wife found out she had colon cancer.  It was operable, and so
our little ward decided we would have a fast before she went in the hospital for the operation.</p>
<p>It was fast day the Sunday before the Monday she was due to go into the hospital and I
was awakened that morning at 5:00 a.m. by my wife crying silently into her pillow.  As I put my
arm around her, I could feel tears and moisture on her pillow and I knew it was serious.  I asked
what she was crying about and she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m worried about those little girls.&#8221;  She had taught
two of them in primary and knew how precious they were.  Surely the Lord wouldn&#8217;t take the
second parent as well.  As I held her in my arms, I knew that she was communicating with me
through the power of the Spirit, and I said, &#8220;Are you suggesting we raise those little girls if
Diane doesn&#8217;t make it?&#8221;  And she nodded, yes.  We decided to fast and pray about it that day and
we did, and that night after we broke our fast we knew what our obligation was.</p>
<p>Promoted by the Spirit, we went to her home.  The home teachers had been there and
given her a wonderful blessing, her brother was there from Bountiful, her sister from Salt Lake,
and her mother (who was 85 years old) who lived in Kaysville was there and they had a
wonderful evening.  We only stayed a few moments, and as we went to leave, at the doorway,
Kay said, &#8220;Diane, we know you are going to make it, but just in case, we want you to know we&#8217;ll
be happy to raise your children if you&#8217;d like us to, just like our own.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Thank you.  
You&#8217;re wonderful friends, but I have a brother who lives in Bountiful, and a sister in Salt Lake,
and my mother lives down town, and they&#8217;ve all asked for them.&#8221;  </p>
<p>We went home, and I felt guilty because I felt like phew, we dodged that bullet.  But my
wife was very quiet and reserved and didn&#8217;t say much.  We put our children in bed, and she went
to bed and I went to the other room to study in my den (I had a check ride on the 727  the next
morning and so I was practicing my emergency procedures) when at 11:00 p.m. the phone rang. 
It was Sister Diane on the other line, and she asked if Kay was still up.  I said she was awake. 
She said, &#8220;Put her on the other phone and you stay on this one.  I want you to hear what we say.&#8221; 
Then, for the next 35 or 40 minutes, I listened while these two good sisters (who were not
particularly close friends) talked about how these girls should be raised if Diane didn&#8217;t make it. 
My wife had it all figured out. You know how women are.  President Packer said the inspiration
of a righteous woman is pure revelation.  We had just built a brand-new home, her dream home. 
She insisted on seven bedrooms.  We only had four children.  We used one of the extra bedrooms
as my den and the two in the basement we didn&#8217;t even finish, just roughed them in.  She
explained to Diane that we would put all the girls up stairs where we had two bathrooms, and a
sink in one of the master bedrooms, and we would put the boys downstairs where we would
finish off two bedrooms.  We lived on the main floor where our bedroom was.  They&#8217;d have the
same teachers, the same school, the same ward, the same bus stop, the same home teachers.  It
seemed to be the right thing.</p>
<p>At the end of the discussion, Diane said, &#8220;Well, I only have one more question.  Have 
you prayed about this?&#8221;  We said we had fasted and prayed that day.  She said, &#8220;So have I, and if
it&#8217;s all right I&#8217;d like to come over tonight with my attorney to sign the papers.&#8221;  So at 12 o&#8217;clock
that night, her attorney (who later became my first counselor in the stake presidency) and she
came over and on an old broken down typewriter on our kitchen table, he typed out her last will
and testament.  In it we were to receive the children should she die.</p>
<p>Well, she didn&#8217;t die.  The operation was a success, and she lived five more years,
wonderful years.  The children raised to five years older.  The oldest one was 17, the youngest
about eight, when their mother came down with cancer again and died, and we inherited four
little girls.  What a great blessing they have been to our lives.  Sons and daughters.  One of them
wrote a poem.  I hadn&#8217;t planned on using it, but I will.  She wrote it and gave it to her mother and
me about four years ago.</p>

<p>A defining moment of our lives?  Yes.  Brought to us by the Spirit, the Holy Ghost?  Yes. 
Revelation through a righteous woman?  Yes.  Let me tell you, I have found that in life&#8217;s
defining moments, the Spirit is always evident.  I have found, by way of instruction to you, there
are three things which we must do to become spiritually self-reliant and to partake of the Spirit
and understand life&#8217;s defining moments.</p>
<p>The first is 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">personal purity</span>.  In Doctrine and Covenants 121:36 it tells us 
		<i>&#8220;the powers of
heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.&#8221;</i>  And in
Doctrines and Covenants 50:28-29 it reminds us <i>&#8220;but no man is possessor of all things except he
be purified and cleansed from all sin.  And if ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye shall
ask whatsoever ye will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done.&#8221;</i>  This is the basis for effective
parenting, teaching, leading, and raising your families in the gospel.  And of course it is the basis
for all else in our lives to bring us happiness and joy.  It is essential for spiritual self-reliance. 
And so we must <i>&#8220;be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 38:42). 
This personal righteousness, then, is the first requirement for spiritual self-reliance in
understanding life&#8217;s defining moments in your lives.  Personal purity comes when you have a
strong personal faith in God the Father and his son Jesus Christ, your personal Savior, and the 
Savior of all mankind.  It comes when you have a testimony of Him.  It comes when you keep all
of his commandments, including daily prayer, pleading for strength.  Daily scripture study,
attendance at sacrament meetings.  Payment of tithes and offerings, and living a chaste and moral
life, truly loving the Lord and your neighbor. Trying to keep all of the Lord&#8217;s commandments,
always remembering Him and repenting properly when mistakes are made in your life, as I had
to after the beer party up the canyon.  It comes when you learn and study and follow the teaching
of our modern day prophets.  We are led by a prophet of God.  I have worked at his side, I have
learned at his feet.  I know he is a prophet of God.  It includes proper understanding and
application of the gospel principles and procedures, and pondering General Conference talks,
church magazines, including handbooks and administrative policies.   And it comes finally, as
President Kimball so lovingly taught us,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When a man begins to hunger, when arms begin to reach, when knees begin to
bend and voices begin to articulate; then and only then does the Lord make
Himself known.  He pushes back the horizons, he breaks the curtain above us, and
He makes it possible for us to come out of the dim, uncertain stumbling of life into
the sureness of eternal life (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball 454).</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Personal purity, then, is the first requirement for spiritual self-reliance and knowing the
defining moments of your life.</p>
<p>The second I call 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">purity of need</span>.  There must be a need, not just a want, and we must 
distinguish between our wants and needs.  We are taught in Doctrine and Covenants 11:7 to
		<i>&#8220;seek not for riches, but for wisdom, and behold the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto
you.&#8221;</i>  Do you, in your personal prayers, in your private and earnest prayers, do you pray for
others or only for yourself?  In Philippians 4:19 it says <i>&#8220;but my God shall supply all your need
according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.&#8221; </i>This is not referring to just material needs,
but more importantly, spiritual needs and understanding the promptings of the Holy Ghost and
hearkening to the promptings of the Spirit.  In Matthew 6:8 it states:<i> &#8220;For your father knoweth
what things you have need of before you ask him.&#8221; </i>Certainly the Lord knows 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">all</span> of our needs,
<i>&#8220;every man according to his wants and his needs, inasmuch as his wants are just&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 82:17).  Then they become needs.</p>
<p>All of these things prepare us for the final and necessary step, perhaps the most important
of all, the third step, <span style="text-decoration: underline">purity of purpose</span>.  If we can learn not to worry about what makes us look
good, or what supports our personal causes or desires, but if we can be just concern only with
only what is best for our families, loved ones, our spouse, our friends, our roommates and others,
and of course the Lord, if we can be more concerned for others rather than ourselves and be more
Christ like in giving our time, talents and all that we have toward the needs and righteous desires
of our loved ones and fellow men and women, and the church;
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">then our purposes will be pure</span>. 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Then and only then are we worthy of the companionship of the Comforter</span>, the Holy Ghost.  And
with the full time companionship of the Holy Ghost, and the Spirit, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">we become spiritually self-reliant</span>.  Then and only then will you understand those defining moments in your life.</p>
<p>In Alma 29:9 it says 
		<i>&#8220;I know that which the Lord hath commanded me and I glory in it.  I
do not glory in myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me.  Yea, and this is 
my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God, to bring some soul to
repentance: and this is my joy.&#8221;</i>  That&#8217;s the purity of purpose I am talking about.  We&#8217;re
counseled in Galatians 6:2 to<i> &#8220;bear ye one another&#39;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.&#8221;
		</i>And what is the law of Christ, anyway?  The law of Christ is the light of Christ by which all
things are governed.  In Doctrine and Covenants 88:3 <i>&#8220;wherefore, I now send upon you another
Comforter, even upon you my friends, that it may abide in your hearts, even the Holy Spirit of
promise; which other Comforter is the same that I promised unto my disciples, as is recorded in
the testimony of John.&#8221;</i>  Another scripture that gives even clearer definition of the purity of
purpose is in Mosiah 18:8-9.  You missionaries are especially familiar with this one.
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now as ye are desirous to come unto the fold of God, and be called his
people, and are willing to bear one another&#8217;s burdens, that they may be light; yea
and are will to mourn with those that mourn; and comfort those that stand in need
of comfort, and stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all
places that ye may in, even until death . . . that ye be numbered with those of the
first resurrection that ye may have eternal life.</i></p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s the reason that I feel so good about the spirit at this great university, BYU-Idaho.  I know of no other church in all the world that gives us greater opportunity to feel the
Light of Christ and to have the full-time companionship of the Holy Spirit than the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  President Hinckley has counseled us recently that 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>no people on earth have a greater responsibility than do we.  No people have ever
worked under a more compelling mandate.  This great work of the Lord will roll
forth in grander and majesty.  (You are) called from among the masses of the
world for reasons I do not know, to lead and to guide and direct the Lord&#8217;s
work.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Revelation came in the early days of the church and it&#8217;s still with us today.  Think of this:
of the six plus billion people of the world, there are only 12 million of we Latter-day Saints that
know the real truth.  Less then one-tenth of one percent.  How fortunate, what a fortunate few we
are.</p>
<p>President Romney said this: 
		<i>&#8220;Teaching cannot come from the unlearned, support and
understanding cannot come from the emotionally starved and [most importantly] spiritual
guidance cannot come from the spiritually weak.&#8221;</i>  We simply must be spiritually self-reliant and
thus spiritually strong.  In the October conference of, President Romney issued another very
profound statement: <i>&#8220;Now I can tell you that you can make every decision in your life correctly
if you can learn to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  When you learn to walk by the Spirit,
you need never make a mistake.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>May I remind you again of all the great blessings of being spiritually self-reliant, of
literally receiving the diverse manifestations of the Spirit.  You&#8217;ve all felt some of these things. 
Some are even too sacred to discuss, but let me close with just a few scriptures that you need to
know.  The Spirit sometimes evidences itself in physical feelings or emotions.  It causes our
bosoms to burn and swell.  That&#8217;s the most common reference: <i>&#8220;You must study it out in your 
mind; then you must ask me if it is right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn
within you; therefore you shall feel that it is right&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 9:8). In Luke 24:32
it says <i>&#8220;And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked to us by
the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>You can also have righteous joy that prompts you, that the Spirit prompts you.  In
Doctrine and Covenants 11:13,<i> &#8220;I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your
mind, which shall fill your soul with joy.&#8221; </i>The Spirit tells us in our hearts and our minds and
feelings.  Quoting from Joseph Smith&#8217;s first vision, <i>&#8220;And while I was thus struggling in the
spirit, behold the voice of the Lord came into my mind again.&#8221;</i>  In Doctrine and Covenants 6:23
it talks about peace to your mind: <i>&#8220;Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning this manner? 
What greater witness can you have than from God?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Of course we know of the spirit of revelation in our church, 
		<i>&#8220;I will tell you in your mind
and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your
heart.  Now behold, this is the spirit of revelation.  This is the Spirit by which Moses brought the
children of Israel through the Red sea on dry ground&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 8:2-3).</p>
<p>Well, there are many others, too numerous to mention.  I will leave them in my text for
you to refer to.  But knowing that the Spirit comes upon us when we need it the most, and when
we are desirous of it, when we have purity of self, when we&#8217;re clean that bear the vessels of the
Lord, when we have purity of need, not just our wants, but our real needs, and when we have
purity of purpose.  I hope and pray that all of you will understand the significance of your life by
understanding the defining moments of your life.  I have had numerous defining moments and
many occasions when I have literally been prompted by the Spirit.  If we could advance to a
couple more, I&#8217;d like to quote one more to you in conclusion.  My favorite is this one: 
		<i>&#8220;Yea, thus
saith the still small voice, which whispereth through and pierceth all things, and often times it
maketh my bones to quake while it maketh manifest&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 85:6).</p>
<p>Yes, you are entitled to the Spirit of God.  You are entitled to a constant companion, you
are entitled to the blessings the Lord has in store for you.  You, above all the people of the world,
are entitled to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.  I know God lives, that He hears
and answers prayers, that Jesus Christ is indeed the Savior of all mankind.  That we&#8217;re here for a
specific purpose, and that purpose is to spread the gospel plan, to find our spouse and to raise
righteous families, to spread the good word that the restoration has taken place and that the
gospel in its fullness is here on the earth today, and that we are led by a prophet of God.  I&#8217;m
grateful to be among you and to feel of your special spirit.  In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>To you wonderful young people, on the way over from where we had lunch, one of your
fellow students said to me, &#8220;Elder Richards, what is the real success in raising righteous
children?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;To marry somebody way above yourself.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve done that, and if there is any
success in my life or with our family, it&#8217;s because of Sister Richards, and I am grateful to have
her here today.</p>
<p>As I look into your faces, it&#8217;s hard for me to really believe that I&#8217;m here.  I remember
many, many years ago attending devotionals like this at Brigham Young University when it was
even smaller than BYU-Idaho is today.  I still remember many of the talks that were given, or at
least parts, because they blessed my life in the ensuing years.  My great desire today, young
people, is to say something that will touch someone&#8217;s life here today and help you to make a
change or a resolve to be better than you are.  I know of the great potential that you have. The
other day Elder Ballard, in a Missionary Executive Council, speaking of the missionaries that are
out serving, and you&#8217;ve heard this expression, that they are the greatest generation of
missionaries.  He put a new light on that for me when he said &#8220;They have to be today because of
the chaos and confusion that is in the world today.&#8221;  To you young people, you need to step up to
the great responsibility that will be yours in the years to come in building and defending that
kingdom of God.  There is no greater cause on the face of this earth, than that in which we are
engaged.  May I just share some thoughts and feelings with you today regarding your lives and
hopefully that will bless and benefit you.</p>
<p>One of the greatest gifts that we enjoy in the church today, and I loved the scripture that
this young man read to us, is that we are built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets.  I
testify of that to you today.  One of the great blessings that we receive through them for us as
individuals is the spirit of prophecy and revelation.  The Lord, since Adam&#8217;s time, has warned
and forewarned us and all the peoples that have come through the centuries.  He has never left us
in the dark as to what we must do.  He has given us commandments, and he continues to
enlighten us through the spirit of prophecy and revelation.  And so, young people, as you face
the future, you don&#8217;t need to face it with fear or trepidation because with the revelations that we
have received and that we will yet receive through the prophets, we will know what the Lord
expects of us.  Our time is no different from in the times past.  In November of 1831, the Lord
gave us the preface to His Doctrine and Covenants.  May I just read parts of some of the verses
from that very first section and invite you to study it on your own?  The Lord says,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Hearken O ye people of my church  . . . The voice of warning shall be unto all
people.  Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come . . . Wherefore, I the
Lord, knowing the calamity which shall come upon the inhabitants of the earth,
called upon my servant Joseph Smith Jr. and spake unto him from heaven and
gave unto him commandments </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 1).</p>
<p>So in the very beginning of this dispensation the Lord began to reveal His will and
commandments.  And then His counsel to each of us is this:</p>

<p>I want to share and experience Sister Richards and I had in Hong Kong and then relate it,
hopefully, to you great young people today.  We had an assignment to go to Bangkok, Thailand,
and we were to leave Hong Kong around 4:00 in the afternoon.  I don&#8217;t know if any of you have
ever flown in or out of the new Hong Kong airport, but it&#8217;s been rated number one in the world
the last several years.  It&#8217;s just a marvelous place.  There are two main runways that are
separated by large grass strips.  We were in a large aircraft with over 300 passengers aboard, and
were actually in the process of taking off, and the plane was accelerating.  I always love that
feeling.  All of a sudden the pilot just slammed on the brakes of this huge aircraft and we came to
a screeching halt.  Almost instantly you could begin to smell the smoke from those mighty
brakes.  We were sitting on the right side of the aircraft and as I looked out the window, all of a
sudden I realized there were nine fire trucks heading our way.  Now that gets your attention,
young people.  And they weren&#8217;t going around the suggested route, they were coming down the
grass between the runways, headed directly for us.  In fact, one came up right under the wing and
went to the front of the aircraft.  And then we noticed that four  security trucks were also headed
our direction.  The pilot came in over the intercom and said &#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, don&#8217;t be
alarmed.&#8221;  That got our attention, seeing all this activity.  And he said, &#8220;We have experienced a
minor malfunction and we&#8217;ll see if they can correct it on the runway.  If not, we&#8217;ll have to return
to the terminal.&#8221;  So, after a few minutes of smelling the smoke and watching these fire trucks
and all the security around us, he finally came back and said, &#8220;We will have to return to the
terminal and change aircrafts and then we&#8217;ll proceed on our way.&#8221;</p>
<p>While we were waiting to taxi back the airport, one of the crew, came out and began to
apologize to us.  We were sitting near the front of the aircraft and had we not had our seat belts
on we would have ended up ten rows in front.  I mean he stopped that huge aircraft that quickly. 
He began to apologize saying &#8220;We recognized that in the process of taking off, one of the gauges
was indicating a malfunction, and we had to make a split second decision whether to continue or
to abort the take off.&#8221;  And then he said that &#8220;one of the gauges was telling us that the amount of
fuel going into one of the engines far exceeded what was normal, and so we made the decision to
abort the take off.&#8221;  We were sitting right up front, and I couldn&#8217;t help but say to him, &#8220;You
don&#8217;t need to apologize to me.  I&#8217;d rather be on the ground with this problem that at 30-40, 000
feet in the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>Young people, why do I tell you that story?  Sister Richards and I were grateful at that
moment that those two pilots had been so well trained.  If you ever look in one of the cockpits of
one of those large aircraft, there are just, to me, thousands of gauges.  They were trained so well,
that when they recognized the malfunction, they knew exactly what to do, and even though we
were in the middle of a takeoff, they hit those brakes, and we came to a screeching halt.  Later
we were able to get on another aircraft and finish our journey to Thailand.  Each of us and each
of you must know what the gauges are in the Lord&#8217;s kingdom, and you must understand them to
some degree and you must monitor them regularly so that as you need to make a course
correction or slam on the brakes, or even just do a fine tune, you know how and what&#8217;s required
and what the Lord expects.</p>
<p>One of the great blessings that each of us have is the gift of choice, or agency.  It truly is
a remarkable and powerful gift.  Sometimes we don&#8217;t understand it as we should.  For instance,
if I were to ask all of you today that in your teen years, when your parents suggested that you do
something, you responded something like this: &#8220;Well I can do what I want.  I have my freedom
of choice.&#8221;  Have any of you ever said that to your parents?  If you haven&#8217;t, I will meet with you
after and we will have a personal interview.  There&#8217;s something about agency that each of us
must understand, though, and I want to share that with you from For the Strength of Youth.  How
many of you have this little pamphlet called For the Strength of Youth that you should have
received in your Young Man/Young Woman years still in your possession today?  Just out of
curiosity. That&#8217;s great!  How many of you have read it in the last week?  How many of you have
read it in the last six months?  Good!  Can I ask you to put it right with your scriptures because if
you want to know what the Lord expects or counsels us to do now, particularly you great young
people of the church, this is the message.  Let me just share from that the chapter called Agency
and Accountability and then make some observations regarding the gauges that the Lord would
have us monitor.  <i>&#8220;Wherefore, men . . .   are free choose liberty and eternal life, through the
great Mediator of all man or to choose captivity and death&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 2:27).  When you boil
agency right down, it leads to one or the other in the choices that we make.  Now, from the First
Presidency:  <i>&#8220;While you are here on earth, you are being proven&#8221;</i> (For the Strength of Youth 4). 
Young people, will you remember every day that this life is a time to prove yourself worthy to
enter back into the presence of God?  That was one of the conditions that we fought for and that
we made commitments to do as we watched this earth life begin to unfold.  <i>&#8220;You are being
proven to see if you will use your agency to show your love for God by keeping His
commandments.&#8221; </i>Now, listen carefully: <i>&#8220;While you are free to choose for yourself, you are not
free to choose the consequences of your actions.&#8221;</i>  That&#8217;s a point that I think a lot of us don&#8217;t
totally understand - <i>&#8220;While you are free to choose for yourself, you are not free to choose the
consequences of your actions. When you make a choice, you will receive the consequences of
that choice.&#8221; </i>Now listen carefully - <i>&#8220;The consequences may not be immediate, but they will
always follow, for good or bad&#8221;</i> (4).</p>
<p>Now let me add a footnote to that, taken from a commentary written by Smith and Sodal
many years ago: &#8220;Deviation from the narrow path always brings with it some consequences
which remain after the sin after the sin has been pardoned.&#8221;  Can I invite each of you to get For
the Strength of Youth out and read that chapter or section on Agency and Accountability, and
understand as you&#8217;ve never understood before, the right of choice which we love and appreciate,
remembering that with those choices we cannot choose the consequence which may follow? 
Even though we may have been forgiven and we sense that deeply in our hearts, sometimes the
consequence of that which we do inappropriately or which goes against the will of God may
linger long after that forgiveness has come.  Again listen carefully: <i>&#8220;You are responsible for the
choices you make.  You should not blame your circumstances, your family, or your friends if you
choose to disobey God&#8217;s commandments.&#8221; </i>That&#8217;s the accountability part of this wonderful gift
that we each enjoy.<i> &#8220;You are also responsible for developing the abilities and talents Heavenly
Father has given you.  You are accountable to Him for what you do with your abilities and how
you spend your time&#8221;</i> (5).</p>
<p>Can I liken that and three or four other things to those gauges that those two pilots were
reading and who needed to make a split second decision and for which perhaps, hundreds of
lives were saved?  One of the gauges, young people, that you should be monitoring right now is
this opportunity you have of attending BYU-Idaho and receiving an excellent education.  Each
day you will make choices which will make that education either powerful or not as powerful as
it could be by what you do and the way you accept this great opportunity and responsibility. 
There are some perhaps, on campus, who have not yet had the opportunity to serve a mission,
and I&#8217;m speaking primarily now to the young men.  The Lord invited every young man who
holds the Aaronic priesthood or who may yet join the church before age 19 to serve a full time
mission.  It&#8217;s true the bar has been raised, and we are seeing remarkable results as a result of that. 
But to you young men who have not yet made that choice, or may be struggling with it, if you
will think in terms of not what you will be giving up, but what you can give to the world, it
should just add to the dimension of the significance of that decision.  Oh, how we need
missionaries in the world today.  We need them desperately.  We need them to teach the gospel
message.  That&#8217;s the only hope the world has, really, in its long term run: it is the gospel of Jesus
Christ.  I look into your faces and I think of the words of Elder Holland as he expressed it to
about 200 missionaries in England one Saturday morning when he looked into their faces (and
you are all familiar with the hymn Hope of Israel).  He pointed and he said, and I wish I could
say it like he does: &#8220;You are the hope of Israel.&#8221;  And young people, without you and your
righteous decisions, Israel may not have the great hope that it could or should.</p>
<p>One of the other gauges, and if you were to go back over the last ten years and have
before you the sermons of our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, there&#8217;s a subject he has
continually and continues to address which has become one of the great concerns in the church
today and that&#8217;s the evil of pornography.  I just can&#8217;t tell you the effects of that evil in the lives
of people in the world, in the church, and it&#8217;s devastating affect on individuals and families. 
Again, For the Strength of Young, may I just read what the Brethren have to say about that evil:
		<i>&#8220;Pornography in all its forms is especially dangerous and addictive&#8221;</i> (17). And it is.  I think
back when I was a young missionary the Word of Wisdom and tithing were the two major
concerns we addressed.  Well, times have changed, but pornography, at least to me, is much,
much, much more addictive than cigarettes or alcohol.  It&#8217;s that calamitous.  What may begin as
a curious indulgence can become a destructive habit that takes control of your life.  It can lead
you to sexual transgression, even criminal behavior.  Pornography is a poison that weakens your
self control, changes the way you see others, causes you to lose the guidance of the spirit, and
can even affect your ability to have a normal relationship with your future spouse.  If you
encounter pornography, turn away from it immediately.  Can I just plead with you young people,
you monitor that gauge very carefully, and if you need to slam on the brakes then you slam the
brakes on right now, and you make sure that you keep that gauge fine tuned, the way it should
be.  May I also read from For the Strength of youth just a couple of things from the section
		<i>Sexual Purity</i>: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and
woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife. </i>[That comes from the
Proclamation on the Family.] <i>Physical intimacy between husband and wife is
beautiful and sacred.  It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for
the expression of love between husband and wife.  God has commanded that
sexual intimacy be reserved for marriage </i>(26)<i>.</i></p>
<p>You protect yourself from the emotional damage that always comes from sharing
physical intimacies with someone outside of marriage.  Do not have sexual relations before
marriage and be completely faithful to your spouse after marriage.  The prophet Alma taught that
sexual sins are more serious than any other sins, except murder or denying the Holy Ghost. 
Young people, that&#8217;s another gauge that you must keep, we all must keep focused and monitored
and read and understand, and the world is going just the opposite way, as you well know.</p>
<p>Can I just say something quickly about dress and appearance, particularly to you returned
missionaries?  I remember an experience I had after I&#8217;d been home about three weeks.  I was
going to priesthood meeting, and my sister, who is here today, had bought me a brand-new sport
shirt, and I really liked it, and a pair of slacks.  I was just going out the door to priesthood
meeting when my father was coming from one of his stake meetings and he asked me, &#8220;Son,
where are you going?&#8221;  And I said &#8220;Dad, you know where I&#8217;m going; I am going to priesthood
meeting.&#8221;  And he said, &#8220;Like that?&#8221;  And I thought, I&#8217;ve got a new pair of slacks and a new
sports shirt.  He sat me down in the living room, put his arm around me and taught me a great
lesson.  He said, &#8220;The Lord expects more out of returned missionaries.&#8221;  And you know, young
people, that was 1956.  When I&#8217;ve been tempted on a hot summer night to go to a sacrament
meeting in a white shirt and just a tie; I remember that moment.</p>
<p>When we go to church, we go to worship the Lord.  We should go dressed in the very
best that we have.  I think of the wonderful sister missionaries who serve in Indonesia.  It&#8217;s not
required, but because of their love for the church, the sisters there wear gray skirts and blue
blazers.  I said to their mission president when we first visited there, &#8220;Why do they do that?&#8221; 
And he quickly said, &#8220;President Richards, this work is so important that we want everybody to
know and understand that Christ lives and that we have his message.&#8221;  Young people, when you
go to church, or to the temple, go dressed as if you were going to meet the Lord, for surely the
chapels and the temples are His house.</p>
<p>May I just share something about tithing, because you are at a critical point in your life
where tithing will become something that will just be meaningful to you the rest of your life, or a
time that you may begin to struggle with it, because I remember my student days, and funds
don&#8217;t come easy.  But young people, it does not require money to pay tithing, but it does require
faith.  I heard President Hinckley about a year ago say, &#8220;The church doesn&#8217;t need the money. 
The saints need the blessings of faith that come from paying tithing.&#8221;  It doesn&#8217;t matter if you
pay a penny a month, if that is an honest tithe, or if you pay a thousand dollars a month or
whatever it is.  It&#8217;s the principle, and young people it will bless and protect you for the rest of
your lives as you continue faithful.</p>
<p>Well, we could spend a lot more time on those gauges.  My message is, you take those
gauges that perhaps you struggle with the most, and keep them in front of you and monitor them
regularly.  And if you need to slam on the brakes, then you slam the brakes on and you make that
course correction.  If it&#8217;s just fine tuning, then fine tune them, but always keep them working
properly.  If you want the real joy and the real happiness that comes in this life, it comes from
keeping God&#8217;s commandments and doing the things that he would have you do.  The decisions
you make now, at this young age, will greatly affect the rest of your life, or they could.  My
prayer would be that you would always choose the right.</p>
<p>Now, may I just, in closing, leave a thought or two with you.  If you were to again reread
the general conference talks of the brethren over the last ten years, you would find a common
theme of things that will help us in this life.  One is individual and family prayers.  I hope, young
people, that you find time each day, on your own, and those of you that are married, as a family,
to have prayer.  To you future parents, you can say things in prayers to your children that you
can&#8217;t say in other ways.</p>
<p>Scripture study.  I was so pleased to see most of you have your scriptures here today.  If
you will regularly read from the scriptures and particularly the Book of Mormon, you will be a
better student, a better mother, a better father, a better missionary, you name it.  That&#8217;s the power
and spirit of that sacred record.</p>
<p>Well, there are some others - the payment of your tithes and offerings, family home
evenings, service to others, temple attendance.  Those are things each of us can do, and the
promises are amazing and the happiness that comes will be yours.</p>
<p>Now finally, let me just assure you that revelation is real and alive in this church.  We
struggle today in the world with some very serious issues that are pointed directly at the
doctrines of this church. I heard Elder Maxwell say not too long ago, &#8220;Satan&#8217;s not interested in
our athletic program. But he is interested in destroying families and the works done in the
temples of the Lord.&#8221;  You think of the timing, young people, of the Family: A Proclamation to
the World, given in 1995.  Given at a time when we didn&#8217;t face the issues that we face today, but
the answers are there.  The spirit of prophecy and revelation is apparent.  We were visiting with
some of the students at Lunch before this meeting, and part of Europe now is not considered
Christian because of what&#8217;s crept in.  I think of the remarkable witness of the 15 living Prophets
and Apostles dated January 1, 2000 as we entered this new millennium, about the Living Christ. 
The timing is perfect, and in the years and perhaps decades ahead, revelation will always come
as needed for us.  It will come at the appropriate time.  We will be warned and forewarned, and
it&#8217;s our responsibility, young people, to see that we are prepared and understand and monitor
those gauges.</p>
<p>This is a remarkable time that you live in.  People since Adam&#8217;s time have looked to your
time today.  This is the dispensation of the fullness of times.  This kingdom, this church, will
never be given to anyone else, nor will it ever be taken from the face of the earth.  It&#8217;s here to
stay, and we are blessed to have all the keys and authority and revelation that we have in not
only how to direct the Lord&#8217;s work upon the earth at this time, but to bless us individually
through the keeping of those commandments.  I hope each of you will take time to read the talk
of our prophet at the conclusion of the Sunday morning session of conference this last month. 
Let me just share a couple of thoughts and conclude.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Perilous times?  Yes. These are perilous times.  But the human race has lived in
peril from the time before the earth was created.  Somehow, through all the
darkness, there has been a faint but beautiful light.  And now with added luster it
shines upon the world.  It carries with it God&#8217;s plan of happiness for His children. 
It carries with it the great and unfathomable wonders of the Atonement of the
Redeemer . . . </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Almighty is with his people.  We shall have all the 
		revelation that we will
need, if we do our duty and obey the commandments of God . . . </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Do we really comprehend, do we understand the tremendous significance of that
which we have?  This is the summation of the generations of man, the concluding
chapter in the entire panorama of the human experience.</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>And think about it.  You are going to be part of that; you are already.  But what an
exciting time the future holds.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We of this generation are the end harvest of all that has gone before.  It is not
enough to simply be known as a member of this church.  A solemn obligation rests
upon us.  Let us face it and work at it.</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Somehow, among all that have walked the earth, we have been brought forth in this
unique and remarkable season.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Be grateful, and above all be faithful</i> (President Gordon B. Hinckley, 
		<i>The
Dawning of a Brighter Day</i>, General Conference April 2004).</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I conclude with part of the words of the Standard of Truth: &#8220;No
unhallowed hand can stop this work,&#8221; speaking of the Kingdom rolling forth upon the earth. 
And that applies to your individual lives as you monitor those gauges and make the right
decisions, and keep them fine-tuned, &#8220;no unhallowed hand&#8221; can stop you from progressing and
reaching the ultimate goal of eternal life.  Those truths stand firm and in place and secure for
each of you.</p>
<p>Thank you for who you are.  Thank you for what you&#8217;ve done, thank you for what you
are doing, thank you for what you will yet do to build this great kingdom as it rolls forth upon
the face of this earth.  I want to leave you my witness of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Young people, I
know that He lives.  I know that he is our Savior and our Redeemer.  He was born of Mary in
Bethlehem.  We have the witness of the holy scriptures both in the Bible and the Book of
Mormon, of the resurrected, Living Christ.  It&#8217;s Him that we worship.  It&#8217;s Him who our worship
is focused in.  It is Him who will come again and rule and reign upon this earth as Lord of lords
and King of kings. Oh that we will be worthy to recognize and worship him and be welcome into
his presence is my humble prayer for each of you.  God bless you, I leave you this witness in the
name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>President and Sister Bednar, faculty, staff, brothers and sisters, students, friends,
customers - I think I&#8217;ve touched all of you! You know, with the opening song, the prayer, the
scripture reading, and magnificent organ solo, we are truly blessed.  Sister Christensen and I are
blessed to be here.  We have one addition. About two weeks ago, maybe ten days ago, we had
our seventh great-grandchild. Sister Christensen has raised eight children and never raised her
voice.  She&#8217;s an angel. We should have her here.</p>
<p>I want to talk today on forgiveness.  Before I get into that, I want to give you just a
couple of calls that we&#8217;ve had in the church.  I have spent most of my adult life right across the
street from 47 East South Temple where most of the general authorities used to be.  Now they
are in the church office building, but I&#8217;ve known most of them.  In 1996, August 13, I&#8217;m
working in our store at the ZCMI center and one of our little desk girls came up and said, &#8220;Mac,
Elder Haight&#8217;s secretary is on the phone and she wants to talk to you at once.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Fine.&#8221;  I
knew Elder Haight well. He started at ZCMI a long, long time ago, and then I had later on, and
we used to share war stories. We used to go over and take a break and we&#8217;d talk about things that
had happened and things we thought should happen.  I knew him well.  Sweet, kind senior
apostle. So I went over and answered the phone, and his secretary said, &#8220;Elder Haight wants to
talk to you at once.&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;Fine.&#8221;  Elder Haight got on the phone and said, &#8220;Mac, how are
you?&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;Elder Haight, I&#8217;m just fine,&#8221; and I was at that time. And he said, &#8220;I&#8217;d like
you to bring your wife and come over tomorrow at 11:00.  Can you kids do that?&#8221;  And I said,
&#8220;Okay.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Then I&#8217;d like to take you two to lunch. Could you have lunch with me?&#8221;  And
I said fine, and then I thought he was going to hang up, but then he said, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll see you
tomorrow at 11:00.  By the way, we&#8217;re calling you two to be the directors of the Washington
Temple Visitor&#8217;s center,&#8221; and then, Click, he hung up on me. True story.</p>
<p>Sister Christensen just happened that day to be working in the Relief Society Building as
a hostess, and I&#8217;d only been over there, I think once, so I thought I better go over there and tell
her.  So I walked across the street to the Relief Society Building, and I walked in and she looked
up and it frightened her.  She thought something had happened to the children.  She said,
&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;  And I lied to her and said nothing.  Then I told her, and then she went white,
and we spent an interesting day thinking about that. The next day at 11:00 we went over to Elder
Haight&#8217;s office, and it happened to be that after the 13<sup>th</sup> of August comes  the 14<sup>th</sup> of August and
that was and still is Sister Christensen&#8217;s birthday.  And we didn&#8217;t tell Elder Haight that, but we
went over and he told us about the Washington Temple Visitor&#8217;s Center.  Fifty-seven
magnificent acres, spiritual acres, right next to the temple. The beltway comes around you can
see the temple. You&#8217;ll have people from all over the world and just how magnificent it was and
how much he loved that area.  And then he took us down to the lunchroom where the General
Authorities have their lunch, and I&#8217;d been there once or twice before, and people look at you, the
other General Authorities, and wonder if you&#8217;re in trouble or why you&#8217;re there. Some know.  But
he wanted to pay for us, so we went through the line and he pays, takes us over to a table, and we
sit down and immediately Elder Holland came over.  Now, we had lived in Elder Holland&#8217;s ward
and knew him well.  He used to come over to my home and three or four of us would work out in
the mornings. So we knew Elder Holland and then Elder Hales came over. I knew Elder Hales
quite well because when he couldn&#8217;t find someone to play golf with on a Friday or Saturday, he
knew that I could always get him on a golf course. He&#8217;d call and say, &#8220;Can we go look at land?&#8221; 
So, I knew them, but here is this senior apostle with two junior apostles - this was fun.  And
Elder Holland started in on Elder Haight - did you tell them this, did you tell them this, did you
tell them this - a little from Elder Hales, but really Elder Holland.  Finally, Elder Haight said to
the two junior apostles (he called them boys), &#8220;Boys, I&#8217;ve been doing this for a long, long time. 
Now the first thing you do is you get them to say yes, and then you talk about those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>We went back to Washington, D.C. and we were frightened.  We were really frightened. 
You&#8217;re open 365 days a year, you have people from all over.  At Christmas time for about 40
days you have the festival of lights and you have about 400,000 lights out around the temple
grounds, and people come clear from New York, Boston and they come to see the lights.  Then
we have concerts inside and we are getting referrals. It&#8217;s an extremely busy time.  And you might
have thirty buses to park and no where to park them, and if the temple president should say that
if they got on his part of the area and take the patrons&#8217; [parking], we were in trouble. It was a
busy time.  We learned a lot.  We had a lot of things going on. We found that you had to have
people in the visitors center, and our responsibility was to make friends, to give everyone who
came there a spiritual experience, to get a referral and to send them out with something in their
hand.  We have the greatest sister missionaries in the world.  We would have concerts, we would
have firesides, we had a lot of things going all the time. I remember one night we had a concert
and we had about 600 people in an area that should have had about 300 and it&#8217;s difficult to hear,
especially when you wear hearing aides and I wear them in both ears, and I wear them for one
reason - in order to hear.  But when you have all those people you don&#8217;t hear well.  So,
consequently, this young man came up to me and he asked me a question and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I
can&#8217;t hear you.&#8221;  He asked me again - &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t hear you.&#8221; The third time he asked me, I
just couldn&#8217;t hear him and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t hear you.&#8221;  And he said, &#8220;Hey, take those
things out of your ears and you could hear me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second call: to be the president of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Orchestra
at Temple Square.  What a call.  I&#8217;d been around Temple Square.  Sister Christensen and I,
before we went out to Washington, D.C., were hosts on Temple Square.  We were involved with
hosting Music and the Spoken Word, but that was about it.  And I&#8217;ll tell you about my musical
background, singing especially. We grew up in Central Utah, Sister Christensen in Manti, and I
in Ephraim.  When we graduated from high school, our graduating class was small - we had
about thirty-three.  We sang three or four songs, we had a trombone solo, a couple of talks. My
voice was such that our choir teacher, and she taught other things, but our choir teacher wouldn&#8217;t
let me sing.  I had to lip sync, and my mother has never forgiven her. I used to kid Sister Coals in
our ward - &#8220;Let me just sit up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No Mac, you not-&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Just let me sit up there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>So one day in November of 2000, we had just come back from our mission, and a friend
of mine, who had been the visitor center director in Palmyra, and I were running Senator Hatch&#8217;s
reelection for the senate and we were just finishing.  I thought, This is it, I&#8217;m through, I am going
to be with the grand kids and play golf, enjoy life.  Retail business 43 years, six days a week,
early and late.  I got a call from Don Staheli, secretary to President Hinckley and he said,
&#8220;Brother Mac, President Hinckley would like to see you.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Okay, when?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you come over now?&#8221;  We had an office over in the Key Bank building, just kind of
kitty-corner across the street and down, and I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you come over now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;  Well, he wasn&#8217;t asking Sister Christensen to come.  Our two youngest boys had run the
store in the ZCMI Center.  Since we came back from our mission, our boys (we have fours sons
and a son-in-law that run our business) and they said, &#8220;Dad, if you&#8217;ll just stay out of the stores,
we&#8217;ll send you and mom money.&#8221;  So I wasn&#8217;t involved in the stores, but I thought President
may want to tell me how good these two young men were.  They maybe had pressed his suit or
done something nice for President Hinckley.  So I go over and go in the outer office, and Brother
Staheli takes me right in to see the president, and I had known the president for a long time, and
he said, &#8220;Mac, sit down.&#8221;  So I sit down.  And he said, &#8220;Mac, we are calling you to be president
of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.&#8221;  Sometimes you know there might be a calling coming - I had
no idea.  Especially president of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  I said, &#8220;President, I&#8217;m a
monotone!&#8221; And he kind of looked at me, in only the way he can, and said, &#8220;Mac, we&#8217;re not
calling you to sing.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;President, who do I report to?&#8221;
		</p>
<p>&#8220;You report to me.&#8221; President Hinckley had been and is the advisor to the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir and the Orchestra at Temple Square for over thirty years. Thirty years.  And then he told
me what a magnificent calling this was, how fortunate I was, what great people I had to work
with.  The choir has two music directors, they have two managers, they have a senior secretary
and a part time secretary, they have three organists and two part time organists, and forty
volunteers, 360 members of the choir and about 140 orchestra members. He told me the things
that he wanted to see happen and the things to watch for, things that you would never think that
he would even say.  And who do I report to? I report to the president.  If there is something that
we need to get an approval, you go over and you see him, you call up and make an appointment
and you&#8217;re there.  This last week, Brother Jessop and I were with him Friday.  The week before
we were with him Thursday and Friday.  Sometimes it will go for a month.  I need to tell you: we
have a living prophet, soon to be 94.  Very tender since he lost Sister Hinckley.  He came a week
ago Sunday and thanked the choir for singing at the funeral.  He is moving, he is going.  He has
vision and he is strong.</p>
<p>Now - I have to look at my watch.  I&#8217;m used to doing thirty second commercials.  And
then sometimes you&#8217;ll go a little over, a little under and you&#8217;ll have to do them over, and I have
an eye that I don&#8217;t see out of, but it wanders, so every once in a while Brother Smith&#8217;s brother
does my commercials.  He&#8217;s our producer and he&#8217;ll say &#8220;Mac, your eye&#8217;s wandering.  We got to
do it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now I want to take and talk to you about forgiveness and I want you to stay with me and
I want you to think about this, and I want you to be honest with yourselves. Is there someone that
you need to forgive? Is there someone that&#8217;s hurt you? Maybe in business or school or work,
church, neighbors, family. Has someone hurt you? You need to forgive.  You have a chip on
your shoulder.  Be honest.  Think about that.  Who do you really need to forgive? What&#8217;s
happening to your life if you have a chip on your shoulder? How many of you have had or might
still have hatred? I&#8217;m going to have one person raise their hand.  I&#8217;ve had hatred.  I wanted to
take someone&#8217;s life. No ifs or buts or ands.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you a little story about a young man. When he was about 12 years of age, he
started to take and work - clean, neat, handsome, bright, took after his mom, worked 15-20 hours
a week while he was going to school.  Summertime, 40, 50, 60 hours a week.  But he just had to
read, he had to study. It didn&#8217;t seem like he had enough time to get everything done that he
wanted to do.  He loved books, and read and read and read.  He ended up with over 13,000 books
- not 1,300, but 13,000, primarily church books, church related books.  If he found one he really
liked, he&#8217;d buy a dozen of them and then he&#8217;d give them to certain people.  He loved to read.  He
was a peacemaker.  Everyone but one person loved this young man.  When he was 14 he was
writing talks for all of his friends, church talks, whatever.  When he was a junior in high school,
he loved to debate.  He was a great debater, but he was a little different than most debaters.  He
didn&#8217;t go for the jugular.  When he was through debating someone, they were still friends.  He
won the debate meet at Stanford University as a junior in high school.  As a senior in high
school, most of you are too young to remember this, but we had draft boards.  He was called to
be on the draft board for the county that he lived in.  He went on a mission to Australia, one of
the first Italian speaking missionaries to go down. I think there were 12 that went down.  Loved
those people, worked with the Italians. He was an assistant to the president. He came home and
he had a burning desire to work in the temple.  He was a temple worker right after he got home,
which was unusual then. He was called to a church writing committee in his early 20s, and then
he was called to be the chairman of that writing committee. He had a brilliant mind. His stake
president went to get him cleared from that committee. He wanted to call him as a bishop.  They
wouldn&#8217;t clear him.  Stake president was tenacious.  The stake president&#8217;s wife used to be the
Relief Society president - her last name was Smoot.  His name was Stan.  He went back a year
later and had the boy released, and was a bishop.  Of course, married in the temple, three little
boys.  Loved to give firesides about the church.  Here&#8217;s what this one thought, here&#8217;s what this
one thought, here&#8217;s what this one thought, just a clean, handsome young man.</p>
<p>Most of you weren&#8217;t born, probably, in 1985.  On a Sunday evening, October, this young
man was called by his stake presidency to come into the stake presidency.  He was still serving
as a bishop.  He was never set apart in that stake presidency.  On Tuesday morning, he went to
work.  The front of his office, right in the front door, as he got ready to open his door, he picked
up this packed that had his name on it, and he lost his life.  It was a bomb.  That was our son,
Sister Christensen&#8217;s and my son, Steven Christensen.  Most of you are too young to remember
the Hoffman case. He was a forger. He blew two people up with bombs, trying basically to protect
himself. I remember that day. I remember the Chaplin from the police department coming over
to my store and telling me that we&#8217;d lost a son. I remember going home, not knowing what had
happened.  A friend took me home, thinking, Why couldn&#8217;t it have been me? This boy had so
much to offer.  What has happened? I go home, his wife comes up.  Three little boys, she&#8217;s
pregnant, just so happened the fourth son was born on January the 9<sup>th</sup> that following year.  Four
sons.  I remember the funeral.  The funeral was in his ward.  Police dogs all around the funeral. 
Just later the day we lost this boy, another person had picked up a box and lost their life.  No one
knew, really, what was going on.  The person who set these bombs off just about killed himself
accidently with a bomb.  When we found out who it really was, and the police were very, very
good to us and kept us informed.  It was a long process to really pin this thing down, but when
we really found out, I said to myself, &#8220;If the authorities don&#8217;t take care of this person, I will.&#8221;  I
had so much hatred.  Can you imagine losing - this is your oldest son, one of your pride and joys. 
I don&#8217;t think he ever had a bad thought.  And then you take his dad, and I&#8217;ve been an aggressive
person all my life.  I was sixth man on a five-man basketball team.  When the coach would
finally put me in, he&#8217;d always say, &#8220;Mac, shoot yourself out of the game.&#8221;  If someone fouled me
the next time down the court, the kid was in the bleachers and I had to fight the kid and his dad. 
I was a very aggressive young man.  An eye for an eye, you know, if someone looked cross-eyed
at you.</p>
<p>I remember there was a pre-trial and in it, they had this person nailed.  I remember
coming out one day, we had our three sons (we had five sons - lost the first one, the youngest
one was in Bolivia on a mission) and our oldest daughter.  We came out and the news media all
around, and they are very aggressive and the one son, they had the camera right up against him. 
Obnoxious.  This boy took after him.  And something hit me and said, &#8220;Mac, you have to
forgive.&#8221;  Now how do you forgive someone who has taken your son? How do you really,
seriously? It&#8217;s easy to say, but how do you do it? How does an aversive individual do it? But I
could see what it could do to our family.  The boy that took after the media, very aggressive boy,
in fact our whole family, thank goodness they have their mother - sweet and gentle, but then
there&#8217;s that other side.</p>
<p>Well, just to give you a couple of thoughts.  You have to forgive.  We have the greatest
family.  We never bring up what happened.  In our home we have a picture of the boy, a big
picture, we have a picture in the main store, but it&#8217;s a happy picture.  If this person that took
these two lives is in jail for life, and sometime he could be released, but if I had to write a letter
and say don&#8217;t release him, I wouldn&#8217;t do that.  Later on I met his dad and mother.  His dad was a
temple worker, very sweet man.  Can you imagine what they went through?</p>
<p>Just a couple of thoughts from our Savior.  
		<i>&#8220;Love your enemies.&#8221;</i>  How do you love
someone that&#8217;s murdered your son? <i>&#8220;Bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,
and pray for them that use you, and persecute you&#8221; </i>(Matthew 5:44). How do you do that? If you
want to have peace of mind, if you want to be forgiven, then you forgive.  You have no choice. 
And make sure your family members forgive.  You forgive.  Let each of us look back over his or
her life and recall the time when we have forgiven someone.  Has any other joy been more
gratifying? Has any other feeling been more uplifting? The feelings of smallness, pettiness, and
hate or longing for revenge are crowded out by the attitude to forgive. Forgiveness is better than
revenge, forgiveness is the sign of a gentle nature, but revenge the sign of a savage nature.
Harboring resentment is poison for you and for your family. Few things will canker the soul
faster and kill spiritual growth more than a wrong left unforgiven. Don&#8217;t let your family harbor
resentment toward others. Taste the enjoyment of life. Please, please, please, please forgive. I
say this in Jesus&#8217; name, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Many attributes adorn the personality of Nephi, making him a very special human being -
prophet, teacher, ruler, colonizer, builder, craftsman, writer, poet, military leader, son, husband,
brother, and many other traits that made of him <i>&#8220;highly favored of the Lord&#8221;</i> (1Nephi 1:1). I
have a great love for Nephi, and this afternoon I would like to talk about him and extract some of
the lessons that I have learned reading of his many spiritual experiences and especially of his
testimony of faith in Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The words of President Marion G. Romney are a testimony of the exemplary life of Nephi:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>I believe with all my heart&#8230;that if our young people come out of our homes
thoroughly acquainted with the life of Nephi, imbued with the spirit of his courage
and love of truth, they would choose the right when the choice is placed before
them&#8230;</i> (Conference Report, April 1980)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Nephi: A Man of Faith</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Nephi was a man of faith, a faith that was fixed upon Jesus Christ. He was a vivid
example of the equation of faith and power as is explained in Moroni 7:33: <i>&#8220;And Christ hath
said: If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.&#8221;</i> 
Elder Bruce R. McConkie explained that equation in this way: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>No man since the world was had faith without having something along with
it&#8230;faith [or power] is found in all degrees and in all quantities. One man has
faith [or power] to do one thing, and another has power [or faith] to do
something greater </i>(Bruce R. McConkie,
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Lord, Increase Our Faith</span>, 55-56).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The power that we are talking about, together with Nephi&#8217;s fearless attitude resulting of
his great faith, is very well exemplified in a statement that he made when he was commanded to
build a ship: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them. If he should command
me that I should say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I
should say it, it would be done.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Now, pay attention to the words that conclude Nephi&#8217;s reasoning of faith: 
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so many miracles
among the children of men, how is it that he cannot instruct me, that I should
build a ship? </i>(1 Nephi 17:50-51)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Surely you remember when the Lord spoke to the young Nephi saying<i> &#8220;&#8230;Blessed art
thou Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou has sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart&#8221;</i>(1
Nephi 2:19). The Lord will speak to us if we can exercise faith with a similarly &#8220;lowliness of
heart&#8221; as Nephi did. As a result, we will have the strength to face the problems and tests that will
meet us in life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In the first verse that opens the Book of Mormon  we read 
		<i>&#8220;&#8230;having seen many
afflictions in the course of my days, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days&#8230;&#8221; 
		</i>(1
Nephi 1:1)  I am sure that, especially for those people that don&#8217;t know or understand that, &#8220;ye
receive no blessing until after the trial of your faith,&#8221; appears to be difficult to comprehend how
a person can have &#8220;many afflictions&#8221; and still feel &#8220;highly favored of the Lord.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">When you think that some of the afflictions that Nephi had seen during the course of his
days included being nearly murdered on five occasions, living for eight years in the desert,
suffering the persecution and ridicule of his own brothers, having to build a ship being a man
without any skill for the task, and then sail it to the Promise Land, you must come to the
conclusion that Nephi had a great faith and testimony that molded an attitude of good cheer in
life even in time of trials and difficulties of all kind. In his clear and direct manner Elder Bruce
R. McConkie wrote: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>faith and sacrifice go hand in hand. Those who have faith sacrifice freely for the
Lord&#8217;s work, and their acts of sacrifice increase their faith </i>(A New Witness for
the Articles of Faith, 189).</span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>&#8220;The tests and trials of mortality are designed to determine whether men will use
their time and talents in worldly or spiritual pursuits </i>(188).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">With the inspiring example of Nephi&#8217;s faith and the resulting feeling of the work
obediently done come to our minds the words of Elder James E. Talmage: </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>A condition essential to the exercise of a living, growing, sustaining faith in deity
is the consciousness on man&#8217;s part that he is at least endeavoring to live in
accordance with the laws of God as he has learned them&#8230; He must feel that the
trend of his life&#8217;s course is acceptable, that with due allowance for mortal
weakness and human frailty he is in some measure approved by the Lord&#8230; </i>(Elder
James E. Talmage, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Articles of Faith</span>, 102-103)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Goodly Parents</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Isn&#8217;t it significant that the first words that Nephi wrote thirty years after he left
Jerusalem, now in the land of Promise, were those that we find in 1 Nephi 1:1:<i> &#8220;I Nephi, having
been born of goodly parents,&#8230;&#8221; </i>No doubt that those tender feelings that animated the words
&#8220;goodly parents,&#8221; were the result of all the Nephi&#8217;s memories of a righteous and dedicated father
and a prayerful mother touching the heart of a son that had understood and obeyed the words of
the Bible, <i>&#8220;&#8230;keep thy father&#8217;s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother&#8221;</i> (Proverbs
6:20).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Nephi knew that each of us owes a debt to our parents, a debt of gratitude, a debt of
respect and honor. We owe to them a debt for a heritage of truth and dedication to a higher,
better way of life, a treasure of faith and testimony. We owe to them a debt for lives that give us
the opportunity to come to this world and have the great experience of this probationary state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Like somebody said, &#8220;When you drink the water, don&#8217;t forget the spring from which it flows.&#8221;
We need to remember that in order to express our gratitude to our parents, and at the same time
truly enjoy the virtues and blessings and opportunities received from them, individually and
personally, we must earn those attributes anew. The German philosopher Goethe said:   &#8220;What
from our heritage is lent, earn it anew to really possess it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">It is a great challenge and a responsibility to become  &#8220;goodly parents.&#8221;  You, young
people have in you now the seeds of the future. Under normal circumstances and expectations,
there will one day be those who call you &#8220;father&#8221; or &#8220;mother&#8221; and who will be, in great manner,
influenced by the kind of mother and father you are. With that vision and understanding in your
minds and hearts you need to learn the importance of good heritage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Some time ago in a Devotional similar to this I mentioned the following: &#8220;Why would
God make us spend so many years of our life on the earth raising offspring, rearing our children,
rearing his children? One answer might be that man&#8217;s growth includes learning to be part of a
family-particularly learning to be a parent. God is not raising children; He is raising parents-
parents who can someday fulfill the eternal role of parents as God fulfills his.&#8221;

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In the General Conference of April 1913 Elder Heber J. Grant expressed,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>It is indeed a wonderful and a splendid thing to be born of &#8220;goodly parents&#8221; and
it is one of the saddest of all sad things where the son and daughters of &#8220;goodly
parents&#8221; are recreant to the faith of their parents, when they are careless and
indifferent, where they fail to honor their fathers and their mothers, and thereby
fail to honor their God, where they follow after the things of this world, and allow
the ideas of men to blind them</i> (Elder Heber J. Grant, Conference Report, April
1913).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">&#8220;I will go and do&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I believe that one of the most commonly used citations from the scriptures, especially
among young people, is what Nephi said when his father Lehi asked him and his brothers to
return to Jerusalem to the house of Laban and bring the brass plates back into the wilderness
with them. Nephi answered:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the
Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a
way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them </i>(1Nephi 3:7).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">While this is one of the most often quoted passages of the scriptures, we do not always
grasp the full depth of the wisdom therein. If we read in the previous chapter (chapter 2), we find
that Nephi relates the important act of making a valuable decision when he said,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And it came to pass that I Nephi,&#8230;having great desires to know of the mysteries
of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did
soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my
father; wherefore I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers</i> (1Nephi 2:16).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Nephi had great desires to know the mysteries of God himself, so he prayed and as a
result of that action Nephi tells us &#8220;He&#8230; did soften my heart.&#8221; The words of president Brigham
Young are applicable here:<i> &#8220;Let all persons be fervent in prayer, until they know the things of
God for themselves and become certain that they are walking on the path that leads to
everlasting life&#8221; </i>(JD 9:150). The message that Nephi teaches us with these words is that the
Spirit manifested unto him that which he wanted to know. It made him understand and see in
depth. Alma once described this process as having the soul <i>&#8220;illuminated by the light&#8221;</i> (Alma
5:7). This spiritual manifestation that Nephi received is what caused him to believe what his
father has said. And because of it, what happened next? The Lord then spoke to Nephi
saying,<i>&#8220;Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou has sought me diligently, with
lowliness of heart&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 2:19).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Because of Nephi&#8217;s great faith and confidence, he was promised by the Lord that, if he
would keep His commandments, he would prosper and be guided to the promised land, and there
would become <i>&#8220;a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 2:22). Through his
faithfulness and efforts, Nephi was blessed with these marvelous spiritual experiences, and at
this point, as a result of his experiences, his knowledge and conviction had literally become a
part of him. He internalized it. Therefore, we see from this that, when his father approached him,
he did not say, &#8220;I will go and see what happens,&#8221; or &#8220;I will go and look over the situation and
then decide what to do.&#8221;  But rather, his words were, <i>&#8220;I will go and do the things which the Lord
hath commanded, for <span style="font-weight: bold">I know</span>&#8230;&#8221;</i> (1Nephi 3:7 emphasis added) Nephi, to his declaration
concerning his decision of doing what his father has asked him to do, he added his testimony,
saying, &#8220;I will go and do it because I know.&#8221; Showing the consistency of his acts and thinking, a
similar response was given when he said,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>If it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth
nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide the means whereby they can
accomplish the thing which he has commanded them </i>(1 Nephi 17:3).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Correct decision in life based in correct principles lead to correct actions. And while we
are commenting this subject, let me say, young people, that once certain decisions in life are
made, it is not necessary to start over with the mental and spiritual processes each time the
circumstances arise. This saves effort, time, and problems. This type of decision, once made,
constitutes the foundation on which we continue to build throughout life. For example, when you
make the decision to live a clean life, once you decide to be chaste, you act accordingly, and you
always live a pure life. There are people that suffer of the &#8220;yes and no&#8221; attitude, that for example
they have not decided whether or not they believe that the gospel is true, or whether or not they
are going to attend sacrament meeting next Sunday. There are some people who have not
decided whether or not they are going to pay tithing, or whether or not they are going on a
mission, or whether or not they are going to get married in the House of the Lord. The changing
circumstances of life are not important. Once the decision is made, on the basis of correct
principles proceeding forth from an unchanging God, then that determines our course of action
without the necessity of going through the entire process each time temptation, sin, or tests and
difficulties appear. The conclusion is always the same, is the formula prescribed by Nephi: &#8220;I
will go and do, for I know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Nephi &#8211; The leader</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">When we think of Nephi as a leader, come to our minds the words of Lehi talking to his
sons: <i>&#8220;Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and
thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 3:2). To go back to Jerusalem, a twelve to
fifteen day one-way trip through hot, barren country was not an easy task that Lehi asked to his
sons. To understand this challenge gives an added meaning to the words of Nephi &#8220;I will go and
do&#8230;for I know.&#8221;At the same time those words mark and show one on the many differences of
Nephi&#8217;s behavior from that of Laman and Lemuel. What is that makes him different? Nephi&#8217;s
attitude is the determining factor in his behavior. While the attitude of Nephi was positive and
decisive, well manifested in his words: &#8220;I will go and do . . .&#8221; his brothers represented the
negative and indecisive attitude exemplified in the words of Lehi &#8220;behold thy brothers murmur,
saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Elder Sterling W. Sill, is the author of the following comments about the importance of
one&#8217;s attitude: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>If we are going to call ourselves servants of the Master, we ought to act like
servants of the Master. We should remember who we are, that we are the children
of God. If we are ever going to be like God, why should we put off getting started
to act that way? Certainly God is not weak nor poor nor sinful nor incapable. If
we want to be like him, we had better get started&#8230;God is an all-knowing, all
powerful, glorified personage. He is literally the father of our spirits, and
according to the laws of heredity we may become like our Father. In possibility
we are already like him. We posses every potential power. Therefore we should
act the part. Why should we continually think of weakness and failure? We should
stop apologizing, criticizing, procrastinating and offering excuses. We should
stop forcing someone to remind us of our duty as though we were incompetents or
cripples or children. We should cease our falseness and sins. If we keep acting
like the devil, that is what we will become</i> (Sterling W. Sill, Leadership, p 36).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The mentioned difference in their attitudes has been a constant in the life of Nephi and
that of Laman and Lemuel.What was the reaction of Nephi&#8217;s brothers when Laman failed in the
first intent to obtain the records? In the words of Nephi we have the answer, <i>&#8220;&#8230;my brethren
were about to return unto my father in the wilderness&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 3:14). Again a negative attitude.
On the other hand what is that Nephi has to say? <i>&#8220;As the Lord liveth and as we live, we will not
go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the things which the Lord
has commanded us. Wherefore let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord&#8230;&#8221;</i>
(1Nephi 3:14,15)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Now, after they failed the second time in the purpose of obtaining the records from
Laban, Nephi wrote: <i>&#8220;&#8230;Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also was
Lemuel...Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us, their younger
brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 3:28). Once more Laman and
Lemuel&#8217;s behavior is consistent with their attitude. But in the course of the events an
extraordinary experience took place. You know several times divine intervention became
necessary to preserve Nephi from his brothers&#8217; hatred, but even direct evidence of God&#8217;s power
was not enough to change the hardness of their hearts. Imagine the marvelous spiritual
experience of an angel of the Lord, speaking to them in these words-</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>&#8230;Why do you smite your younger brother with a rod? Know ye not that the Lord
has chosen him to be a ruler over you, and this because of your iniquities? Behold
ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your
hands</i> (1 Nephi 3:29).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">And then, again try to imagine after the departure of the divine messenger, Laman and
Lemuel begin complaining another time and saying: <i>&#8220;&#8230;How is it possible that the Lord will
deliver Laban into our hands? He is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can
slay fifty; then why not us?&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 3:31) This is the typical reasoning and reaction of those
people that are disobedient and weak in their faith. I can imagine that for them a logical
reasoning maybe was, &#8220;if Laban can slay fifty why not fifty-four?&#8221; I think that I can answer that
question with another one, &#8220; but is it not the way of thinking of the unbelievers?&#8221; Maybe they
were also asking themselves, &#8220;We have been in Jerusalem twice - why didn&#8217;t the angel come
with this message and promise the first time?&#8221; I think that to answer that question we can go to
Ether chapter 12 Verse 6 where Moroni says: <i>&#8220;&#8230;faith is things which are hoped for and not
seen; wherefore, dispute not because you see not, for you receive no witness until after the trial
of your faith.&#8221; </i>The following statements from President Brigham Young give even more light to
the point: <i>&#8220;Every trial and experience you have passed through is necessary for your salvation&#8221;
		</i>(JD, 8:150), and  <i>&#8220;Every vicissitude we pass through is necessary for experience and example,
and for preparation to enjoy that reward which is for the faithful&#8221; </i>(JD, 9:292).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We have analyzed the reaction of Laman and Lemuel to the assignment received; now let
us consider Nephi&#8217;s position in response of the angel&#8217;s assignment. This is what he said to his
brothers:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>&#8230;Let us go up again unto Jerusalem; and let us be faithful in keeping the
commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why
not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands.
Therefore let us go up&#8230;&#8221;</i> (1Nephi 4:1-2).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">It is amazing how on those few words Nephi shows his attributes of a teacher and a
leader and how at the same time they are a reflection of his faith, obedience testimony, decision
and positive attitude. When Nephi expresses that the Lord &#8220;is mightier than all the earth, then
why not mightier than Laban and his fifty,&#8221; that testimony, a result of his faith and obedience, is
an inspiration for us, demonstrating that Nephi knew God. He knew that the Lord is omnipotent.
He knew that the attributes of God are not only to recite them but also, and principally, to make
them part of ourselves and then act in life in consequence. That is why his decision, the decision
of a leader that is showing the way, was &#8220;let us go up; let us be strong,&#8221; the Lord is with us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Another example that shows the knowledge, the testimony of God that Nephi had and
how that testimony was the determining factor of his behavior is found in his experience after
hearing from Lehi the vision of the tree of life. Please pay attention to the sequence of the
different steps, that with the ability of a great teacher, Nephi explains:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>&#8230;I, Nephi having heard all the words of my father, concerning the things which
he saw in a vision, and also the things which he spake by the power of the Holy
Ghost, which power he received by faith on the Son of God &#8211; and the Son of God
was the Messiah who should come &#8211; I, Nephi was desirous also that I might see,
and hear, and know of this by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of
God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times of old as in times that
he should manifest himself unto the children of men. For he is the same yesterday
to-day, and forever; and the way is prepared for all men from the foundation of
the world, if it so be, that they repent and come unto him. For he that diligently
seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the
power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in the times of old, and as well
in times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one
eternal round</i> (1 Nephi 10:17-19).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We can summarize the different steps mentioned by Nephi in the process to obtain the
desired knowledge and testimony about the tree of life, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-weight: bold">First</span>, Nephi hears all the words of his father about the vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Second,</span> Nephi knows that his father spoke by the power of the Holy Ghost, power that was
received by faith on the Son of God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Third</span>, Nephi desires to have the same experience that his father had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Fourth</span>, Nephi knows that the Holy Ghost is a gift of God unto all of those who are faithful and
this is the same process in all times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Fifth</span>, Nephi knows that God is the same in all times or unchangeable, that is one of the
attributes of God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Sixth</span>, Nephi knows that because God is unchangeable or eternal, His commandments and
promises don&#8217;t change, accordingly &#8220;the mysteries of God shall be unfolded to him&#8221; if like the
scriptures say, he repents and comes unto Him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Elder Bruce R. McConkie, in October of 1971, talking about the relationship about life
eternal and knowing &#8220;the only true God, and Jesus Christ&#8221; said:
		</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>It is one thing to know about God and another to know Him. We know about Him
when we learn that He is a personal being in whose image man is created; when
we learn that the Son is in the express image of his Father&#8217;s person, when we
learn that both the Father and the Son possess certain specified attributes and
powers. But we know them, in the sense of gaining eternal life, when we enjoy and
experience the same things they do. To know God is to think what He thinks, to
feel what He feels, to have the power that He possesses, to comprehend the truths
He understands, and to do what He does. Those who know God become like Him,
and have His kind of life, which is eternal life</i> (Conference Report, Oct 1971).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Nephi: His Testimony of Jesus Christ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Nephi was one of the four major writers of the Book of Mormon who had the privilege to
see the Savior. His testimony of this experience is recorded in the Book of Mormon. We already
mentioned the instance when he prayed expressing his <i>&#8220;great desires to know of the mysteries of
God,&#8221;</i> Nephi says, <i>&#8220;I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my
heart&#8230;&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 2:16)  In chapter 11 of 2 Nephi, in addition of giving testimony of seeing the
Savior, in a messianic way Nephi introduces &#8220;some of the words of Isaiah&#8221; providing an
important insight into the passages that he chooses to quote. In verses two, three and four we
find: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah, for my soul delighteth in his
words. For I will liken his words unto my people, and I will send them forth unto
all my children, <span style="font-weight: bold">for he verily saw my Redeemer</span>, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">even as I have seen him. And
my brother, Jacob also has seen him as I have seen him</span>; wherefore, I will send
their words forth unto my children to prove unto them that my words are true.
Wherefore, by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my
word&#8230;Behold, my soul delighted in proving unto my people the truth of the
coming of Christ&#8230; </i>(2 Nephi 11:2-4 emphasis added)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Elder Russell M. Nelson has written</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Those personal encounters with the premortal Savior have given us the advantage
of knowledge otherwise unattainable. Nephi taught that the Atonement makes
available to all who have faith in Christ a liberation from sin and a spiritual
redemption from the adversary. Hence, all men and women who follow the
example of Christ and enter into His way through repentance and baptism will be
blessed with a baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost &#8211; which brings a remission of
sin and individual guidance &#8211; so that they might endure to the end in faith and
receive eternal life </i>(Elder Russell M. Nelson, &#8216;Heroes from the Book of Mormon&#8217;
13).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">It certainly is a highly spiritual experience to go through the words of Nephi, and read the
&#8220;things of his soul.&#8221;  Nephi&#8217;s strong testimony and declaration made almost 600 years before the
coming of the Savior is still the message that thousands of missionaries and members are taking
to the world, because there are many that don&#8217;t know that<i> &#8220;according to the words of the
prophets, and also the word of the angel of the Lord, his name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of
God&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 25:19). For that reason, with Nephi,</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>...we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to
believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that
we are saved, after all we can do...And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we
preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and write according to our prophecies,
that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their
sins.&#8230;for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not </i>(2 Nephi
25:23,26,28)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">To conclude by way of testimony, we can use the words of Nephi when he speaks to us
plainly, without metaphor or symbol, testifying boldly of Jesus Christ: <i>&#8220;As the Lord liveth, there
is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ of which I have spoken
whereby man can be saved&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 25:20)</span>.</p>

<p>Good afternoon. When my children were younger, I&#8217;d sit on the floor at the end of my
bed with a story book in hand, a child on my lap, and one or two little ones on either side of me. 
		</p>
<p>I love to tell stories. Good stories have a way of portraying great truths. Our minds might not
recognize the imbedded gems when we first hear them, but because they&#8217;re packaged in a story
they can be preserved in our memory. Later, when the story is recalled we can have those &#8220;ah
hah&#8221; moments as the truths before hidden are revealed.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;d like to tell you a story about a missionary. As I do so, I&#8217;d like you to consider
what this Elder was thinking: <i>&#8220;On a rainy summer afternoon, . . . [Elder Cracroft was] tracting
along a gravel road on a hillside above Baden, Switzerland.&#8221;</i> In his own words, he states,

right eye. I learned, as one who had worn brand-new contact lenses for only five
days, that a mote feels like a beam. I quickly extracted the lens, cleaned it, and
prepared to reinsert it. As I held my finger at the ready, a gust of wind swept the
lens from my fingertip. My lens was gone with the wind, and I was aghast -- and
virtually blind, being plunged instantly into 20/600 vision in one eye, which had
been miraculously corrected only a week earlier to 20/20.</i></p>

about my need to see; about our need to meet our three investigator families that
evening; about my feeling that there was more to be gained by finding the lens
than by my learning whatever I was to learn from the loss. As I concluded the
prayer and stood up, I received one of those Joseph Smith &#8216;flashes of
intelligence.&#8217; It surprised me, but I reacted at once. Explaining the plan to my
startled companion, I stood on my feet in the same place I had stood earlier,
squeezed out my left contact lens, and was plunged into the distorted virtual

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">Natural Man Thinking Denies the Miracle&#8217;s of God</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Now, what was this Elder thinking?</p>
<p>Elder Cracroft was virtually blind without his contacts. This happened almost fifty years
ago and contact lenses were new then, they were untried and they were expensive, so expensive,
in fact, that his mission president had to help him buy them. He&#8217;d only had them one week and
now one was gone. And if he followed the impression to take the other one out, logic would tell
him he&#8217;d surely lose them both. Then what would he tell his mission President? I can just hear
the conversation after his companion, Elder Reiding led a blind Elder Cracroft back to the
mission office &#8220;Well, you see, President, it was like this: I had to clean some dust off my right
lens because it was bothering me. It blew away so I took the other one out to see if it&#8217;d blow
away too . . . and it did. But hey, this was bound to happen sooner or later. With 20/600 vision I
should never have even come on a mission. Call my parents, President, let &#8216;em know I&#8217;m coming
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve heard similar dialogues before. They make sense to our natural man mind and
they explain away a multitude of failures. Had Elder Cracroft entertained the fatalistic thinking
of the natural man, an enemy to both God and man, he would have walked away and never
known about the miracle that was in the making that day. Instead of succumbing to the obvious
impossibility of his situation, Elder Cracroft chose &#8220;gospel thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">What Gospel Thinking Is</span></p>
<p>When we talk about &#8220;gospel thinking&#8221; we&#8217;re not talking about a casual experience. The
word, &#8220;gospel&#8221; literally means good tidings. In its original form, it was 
		<i>godspel</i> or <i>God-story</i>, the
story of a God who through his love for His Father and his heed and diligence as His spirit son
received a fullness of truth from him (Doctrine and Covenants 93:26). In doing so he became
like his father in might, majesty and power, and was thus able to offer to become for us, his
brothers and sisters, our Savior (Moses 4:2). The Gospel encompasses all truth, however, we
focus principally on those truths which have the power to create out of man a god. For this
reason as well the gospel might be called, &#8220;the god story.&#8221; We wanted so much to be like our
Heavenly Father that when we heard the plan, we &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold">shouted for joy</span>&#8221; (Job 38:7). And we&#8217;re still
shouting. I can feel it in your presence. The gospel is the plan for our exaltation. It is the most
exciting, exhilarating, promising, powerful, hopeful, rewarding, plan ever imagined. I get excited
every time I think about it.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;think&#8221; comes from the base word meaning &#8220;to know.&#8221; Sometimes it&#8217;s
confused with <i>thinchen </i>which means &#8220;to seem or to appear.&#8221; Webster says &#8220;to think&#8221; is to bring
to the mind, to have in the mind, or to believe (<i>Webster&#8217;s New World College Dictionary</i> 1997,
p. 1390, see <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thank</span> p. 1385). Elder Cracroft, with the gospel in his mind, was able to think
beyond the power of man and reach heavenward for divine help. Gospel thinking links earth with
heaven, and man to God. When done deeply, thinking can be synonymous with pondering or
meditating. I appreciate President Marion G. Romney&#8217;s expression: <i>&#8220;Pondering is, in my feeling,
a form of prayer . . . an approach to the Spirit of the Lord&#8221;</i> (CR, Apr. 1973, p. 117).</p>
<p>President McKay expressed it this way: 
		<i>&#8220;Meditation is one of the most secret, most
sacred doors through which we pass into the presence of the Lord.&#8221;</i> He points out that,<i> &#8220;Jesus
set the example for us when . . . during forty days of fasting, he communed with himself and his
Father and contemplated the responsibility of his own great mission </i>(David O. McKay, CR, Apr.
1967, p. 85).</p>
<p>Elder Cracroft&#8217;s tender prayer opened the sacred doors of communion with the Lord that
day. Let&#8217;s look into this young missionary&#8217;s situation a little more carefully. By doing so we&#8217;ll
find some patterns that may be duplicated in our own lives.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">Gospel Thinking Recognizes that Challenges Can be Blessings</span></p>
<p>First of all, how many of you are familiar with Murphy&#8217;s law? Murphy&#8217;s law says &#8220;if
anything can go wrong, it will.&#8221; Things often go wrong for each of us. We could safely say that
Murphy's Law was in operation when Elder Cracroft lost his lens.</p>
<p>Now, you physics majors listen in, while the rest of us really listen: Elder Tad R.
Callister in his book, <i>Infinite Atonement</i>, explains that, <i>&#8220;In the world of physics there is a law of
thermodynamics known as the law of entropy. It suggests that the universe, left to itself, would
constantly move toward a state of disorder&#8221; </i>(68). He then quotes a noted mathematician by
saying, <i>&#8220;It is a matter of common experience that disorder will tend to increase if things are left
to themselves&#8221;</i> (Ibid., 68,69).</p>
<p>For example, all of us have seen a cup fall off a table and shatter in a thousand pieces on
the floor. Why don&#8217;t the broken pieces just as quickly gather together and jump back onto the
table?</p>
<p>Quoting once again from Elder Callister,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>An intact cup on the table is in a state of high order, but a broken cup on the floor
is in a disordered state. One can go readily from the cup on the table . . . to the
broken cup on the floor . . . but not the other way around. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>This disorder, or condition of progressive randomness, would proceed
uninterrupted unless there were an intelligent, powerful force in the universe that
could somehow reverse this natural course.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">President John Taylor 
		spoke of such an intelligent force: <i>âThese laws [which govern the 
		universe] are under the surveillance and control of the great Law-giver, 
		who manages, controls, and directs all these worlds. If it were not the 
		case, they would move through space in wild confusion, and system would 
		rush against system, and worlds upon worlds would be destroyed, together 
		with their inhabitants.â</i> (Ibid. P. 69; Taylor, Gospel Kingdom, p. 67-68).</p>
<p>As it is in the macro world of the universe, so it is in our own micro worlds. Consider
your bedroom: try not cleaning up for a few weeks and you could lose yourself in the piles of
books and papers, clothes and dishes. How about your appearance? How do you look, or smell
for that matter, when things are left to themselves? I, for one, am a scary sight because disorder
increases when things are left to themselves.</p>
<p>Progressive disorder apparently wasn&#8217;t the condition in the Garden of Eden. There, it
appears that things were in a constant state of order with flowers and fruits coming forth
spontaneously. But in our present state of mortality, opposition &amp; challenges are alive and well.
Our present condition may be nothing more than the &#8220;curse&#8221; the Lord put on the earth. The
scriptures teach us that this curse was &#8220;for our sake&#8221; for without the need to work just to keep
even, let alone get ahead, this probationary state wouldn&#8217;t be a test at all and we wouldn&#8217;t grow.
Imagine Olympic champion, Rulon Gardner, trying to get stronger with nothing but feathers to
lift. Without a force resisting our efforts there would be no growth in our physical body or in our
spirit.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, researchers have measured activity in the reward and pleasure
centers of our brains and discovered that our brains are more stimulated when we have to work
for what we get. (Deseret News, 14 May 2004 p. A1). Lottery winners and free loaders don&#8217;t
enjoy what they receive as much as those who work for what they get. You might say, &#8220;work
works!&#8221; So don&#8217;t even consider asking your professor for an A if you didn&#8217;t work for it. You
wouldn&#8217;t enjoy it anyway! You and I are hardwired for work.</p>
<p>Our work, requiring challenges, are often tailor made for our growth. They are sometimes
more a matter of things going right, not wrong. Remember, Heavenly Father chastens whom he
loves (Doctrine and Covenants 95:1). I love the description Harold W. Wood gives of just such a
challenge.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>On my way to visit the Jameses the other evening, I saw a wheat field that
appeared to be greener and taller than the others. Thinking about it for a while, I
concluded that occasionally some loving farmer drives over the field with his
tractor and pumps manure all over it. I thought, &#8216;My, it&#8217;s just like life. Here we
are minding our business, growing our little hearts out. We&#8217;re really quite green,
somewhat productive, and very sincere. When out of the blue, life deals us a dirty
one, and we&#8217;re up to our eyebrows in manure.&#8217;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We, of course, conclude that life as we know it has just ended and will never be
the same again. But one day, when the smell and the shock are gone, we find
ourselves greener and more productive than we have ever been. Unfortunately,
no matter how often we go through these growing experiences, we are never able
to appreciate the sound of the tractor or the smell of the manure. (</i>The Smell of
Manure, quote by Harold W. Wood).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">Gospel Thinking Results in Miracles</span></p>
<p>Elder Cracroft&#8217;s experience with Murphy&#8217;s law, a supposed &#8220;bad thing happening to
good people,&#8221; or simply the sound of the tractor and the smell of manure, brought him to a holy
place, a realization of his need for the Lord&#8217;s help. Unlike the scientist who was conducting an
experiment that called for the amount of strychnine that would fit on the head of a dime and
because he didn&#8217;t have a dime used two nickels, Elder Cracroft knew that when we obtain help
from the Lord it&#8217;s by strict obedience to the laws upon which the blessing we seek is predicated 
(Doctrine and Covenant 130:21).</p>
<p>He knew that Heavenly Father delights to bless us with blessings small and great
(Doctrine and Covenants 130:21) but that he had to do his part. The Bible Dictionary says that,
		<i>&#8220;Blessings require some work on our part . . . and prayer is a form of work&#8221;</i> (Prayer, p. 753)
The Lord pleads with us to ask of him in prayer. In fact he does it more than 700 times in the
scriptures. Elder Cracroft knew that <span style="font-weight: bold">those who ask</span> receive an answer (3 Nephi 14:7,8). The
Lord told Oliver Cowdery in Doctrine and Covenants 6:14, <i>&#8220;as often as thou hast inquired thou
hast received instruction of my Spirit.&#8221; </i>The Lord is <i>&#8220;bound when [we] do what [he] says&#8221;</i>
Doctrine and Covenants 82:10). Gospel truths such as prayer and faith in the Lord were a part of
the fiber of Elder Cracroft&#8217;s very being. President Joseph Fielding Smith tells us how that
happens:<i> &#8220;through the Holy Ghost the truth is woven into the very fiber and sinews of the body
so that it cannot be forgotten&#8221;</i> (Doctrines of Salvation Vol. 1, p. 47). These truths were a living
power in this young missionary&#8217;s life. They sustained him through the entire experience, for after
receiving the impression from the Holy Ghost to use the same means to locate the lens that had
led to its loss he still had to take the classic step into the dark. He understood our faith can&#8217;t be
rewarded until it&#8217;s tried for, as Moroni teaches, <i>&#8220;ye receive no witness until after the trial of your
faith&#8221; </i>(Ether 12:6).</p>
<p>Just like Elder Cracroft, we&#8217;ll never know what the Lord has in store for us if we stop
somewhere in the middle of the process. A good &#8220;bad example&#8221; of this is found in the experience
of Oliver Cowdery who, serving as Joseph Smith&#8217;s scribe, was granted his request to be able to
translate part of the Book of Mormon. Apparently Oliver began well but the Lord had to chasten
him for stopping short. He told him <i>&#8220;it is because you did not continue as you commenced, when
you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and Covenants
9:5).</p>
<p>John Greenleaf Whittier wisely wrote, &#8220;For of all sad words of tongue or pen, The
saddest are these: &#8216;It might have been!&#8217;&#8221; Had Elder Cracroft not continued as he commenced he
would have denied himself the miracle.</p>
<p>Most often the answers to our prayers are neither instantaneous nor dramatic. Just
because they are not, however, doesn&#8217;t mean that the end result can&#8217;t be the same. President
Joseph F. Smith who was only 15 when he left on a mission to Hawaii, said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When I as a boy first started out in the ministry I would frequently go out and ask
the Lord to show me some marvelous thing, in order that I might receive a
testimony. But the Lord withheld marvels from me, and showed me the truth, line
upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, until he made me
to know the truth from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, and until
doubt and fear had been absolutely purged from me. He did not have to send an
angel from the heavens to do this. <span style="font-weight: bold">By the whisperings of the still small voice of
the spirit of the living God</span>, He gave to me the testimony I possess</i> (<i>CR, April
1900</i>, pp. 40, 41, emphasis added).</p>
<p>President Joseph F. Smith&#8217;s posterity, the power of his service, and the depth of his
writings testify of a miracle that took place, but over an extended time. His very life became the
miracle. And this because, <i>&#8220;the gospel is a living, abiding, eternal, and unchangeable
principle,&#8221;</i> according to President John Taylor (<i>Gospel Kingdom, </i>p. 88) and<i> through the power
of the Holy Ghost its truths are woven into the fibers and sinews of our body and we are never
the same.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">What We Think of the Gospel Makes All the Difference</span></p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks says, 
		<i>&#8220;There are few things more important in this life than
knowing your place in mortality and your potential in eternity</i> (&#8220;The Gospel in Our Lives,&#8221;
		<i>Ensign,</i> May 2002, 35). Achieving our full potential in eternity depends on what we think about
and therefore do with the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>This is clear in Doctrine and Covenants 76. 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">Look at this:</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Telestials </span><i>don&#8217;t accept</i> the
gospel, choosing instead to gratify the thoughts and appetites of the natural man as liars,
sorcerers and adulterers. They live in a world of hurt where misery, pain and destruction run
rampant.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Terrestrials</span>
<i>may accept</i> the gospel on earth but they <i>aren&#8217;t valiant</i> in it. They&#8217;re
honorable men and women of the earth who experience a measure of external peace and safety.
According to President Kimball, the five foolish virgins represent these less than valiant
members of the church (<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle,</i> pp. 253-54). President George Albert Smith
lamented terrestrial level living when he said, <i>&#8220;my feelings are wounded at the indifference, the
carelessness, yea blindness, of many who belong to this great Church, because I know what the
result will be&#8221; </i>(Conference Report, October 1935, p. 122).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Celestials</span> accept the gospel of Jesus Christ wholeheartedly and are valiant in their
testimony. Celestials are Christlike for no one, according to Joseph Smith, can possess this
kingdom except Christ<i> &#8220;or one like him&#8221;</i> (<i>Lectures on Faith</i> 7:9). Remember, however, that just
like Joseph F. Smith it's line upon line and precept upon precept. In the process they begin to
experience <i>&#8220;a peace that passeth all understanding&#8221;</i> here (Philippians 4:7) and they inherit
		<i>&#8220;eternal life in the world to come&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 59:23). 
		<i>&#8220;They are gods, . . .
wherefore, all things are theirs . . .&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 76:58, 59) These are the five wise
virgins who received the truth, and took <i>&#8220;the Holy Spirit for their guide&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and
Covenants 45:57).</p>
<p>Our eternal lives depend on whether we reject the gospel, lukewarmly accept it, or are
valiant in it. Let&#8217;s get a little perspective here. Raise your hands up. Now stretch to the left as far
as you can. This might represent our life in pre-mortality when we were first taught the gospel.</p>
<p>Now stretch to the right. Keep going. This could represent life in eternity. It stretches on and on
without end. OK, hands straight up. Now, clap your hands. That could represent mortality.</p>
<p>In relationship to eternity, it&#8217;s about how long we&#8217;re here. Think we can make it?</p>

<p>You and I will become what we think about, whether it be the gospel or satisfying the
appetites of the flesh for, <i>&#8220;As a man thinketh in his heart so is he&#8221;</i> (Proverbs 23:7). In fact,
President McKay was famous for saying, <i>&#8220;Tell me what you think of when you don't have to
think, and I'll tell you what you are&#8221; </i>(Llewelyn R. McKay, <i>Home Memories of President David
O.</i> cKay [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1956], 253). Understanding the importance of our
thoughts in determining what we do, what we become, and what we inherit in the life hereafter,
is it any wonder that we are encouraged to study the scriptures daily? To sing the songs of Zion?
To listen to wholesome and inspiring music? Or to read uplifting literature? All of these help us
have worthy thoughts. Likewise, are you suprised that Satan works so hard on our thoughts? The
world in which we live is full of Satan&#8217;s way of thinking.</p>
<p>The battle is constant because 
		<i>we can&#8217;t</i> think of nothing at all. Let me illustrate: Try for a
moment to think of nothing at all. OK. What are you thinking? At best you&#8217;re probably thinking,
&#8220;I need to be thinking about nothing.&#8221; Because the mind isn&#8217;t likely to be empty, we have to be
absolutely proactive in our quest to fill our minds with worthy thoughts and worthy music. As
my husband used to tell our missionaries, &#8220;Music is powerful for 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">(fill in the blank) </span>-  for good
or for evil?&#8221; What&#8217;s the answer? Music <i>is</i> powerful for good or for evil, depending on the spirit
that produced it. For everything which inviteth to do good comes from God and everything
which enticeth to do evil comes from Satan (Moroni 7:16, 17).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">To Be Like Jesus We Must Think Like Jesus</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>To be valiant in the testimony of Jesus . . . is to think what he thinks, to believe
what he believes, to say what he would say and do what he would do in the same
situation. It is to have the mind of Christ and be one with him as he is one with his
Father </i>(CR, Oct. 1974, pp. 45-46).</p>
<p>The thoughts of the Lord are not by nature the thoughts of man. The process of changing
our limited mortal view of things for his perfect, unlimited view is called repentance. The Bible
Dictionary says <i>&#8220;Repentance . . . denotes a change of mind&#8221; </i>(p.760). His thoughts are not
limited to our mortal sphere: they are infinite. His thoughts never vary from the knowledge of
things as they really were, are, and will be (Doctrine and Covenants 93:24): He thinks only truth.
He states, <i>&#8220;My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my
thoughts than your thoughts&#8221;</i> (Isaiah 55:8-9).</p>
<p>The world heaps great plaudits on men they esteem as great thinkers. Mention Plato,
Socrates, or Einstein and our ears perk up. We study them and form societies to preserve their
writings and methods. These <i>were</i> great thinkers. Yet, the source of all truth, He whose mercy
and love is responsible for the endowment of any truth in any field is often scoffed at by his own
children in the very world he created for them. All truth, my dear brothers and sisters, is not of
equal value. &#8220;2 + 2 = 4" is not of the same importance as the truth that we are children of a
Heavenly Father who loves us. Because of God&#8217;s great mercy, he has revealed those inestimable,
essential truths and made them available to all. Note who he uses to take these eternal truths to
the world: Doctrine and Covenants 1:23 is graphic, it&#8217;s the &#8220;weak and simple things . . . of the
world.&#8221; That&#8217;s what qualifies me to be with you today and that&#8217;s what qualifed Elder Cracroft.</p>
<p>Thousands of our humble missionaries go forth and as they study and pray, teach and
testify, they experience a change of mind, and that change of mind changes them. Each
revelation of truth is a revelation of Christ himself for <i>He</i> is the truth. Each commandment is a
revelation of his ways for He is the way (John 14:6). Elder Robert R. Steuer said, 
		<i>&#8220;[If we love]
these truths with all our heart, . . . an affinity develops between us and the source of truth itself&#8221;
		</i>(&#8220;Being Teachable,&#8221; Ensign, May 2002, 32). This affinity or close relationship with the Lord
causes a change in us because we become like those we associate with. Alma asked the members
of the church in his time, <i>&#8220;Have ye received his image in your countenances?&#8221;</i> (Alma 5:14) Our
thinking affects our physical appearance as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">Our Spirits Choose to be Subject to the Spirit of God or the Spirit of the Devil</span></p>
<p>But which does the thinking? Our body or our spirit? Elder McConkie says, 
		<i>&#8220;It is the
spirit that thinks, not the mortal tabernacle&#8221;</i> (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i><span style="font-weight: bold">, 
		</span>p. 791). Lehi tells us that our
spirits, in order to act for themselves, had to be enticed to do good or evil (2 Nephi 2:16). If left
to Satan, he would take away from us all that we have or ever hope to have. He is the master of
&#8220;take away.&#8221; Look what happens when you play the take away game with his name. Take away
the &#8220;D.&#8221; Everything that comes from him is 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">evil</span>. Take away the &#8220;E.&#8221; He is repulsively 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">vil[e]</span>.
Take away the &#8220;V.&#8221; His ways will make you 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">il[l]</span>. It&#8217;s hard to remove Satan&#8217;s selfish, self
centered &#8220;I.&#8221; But if we yield to his enticings we may choose to suffer in 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">L</span>. Under so many
disguises, he is still the Father of lies and the great destroyer.</p>
<p>Speaking of taking things away, consider the Bible for a moment. Nephi was told that the
Bible contained the fullness of the gospel when it came forth from the <i>&#8220;mouth of the Jews.&#8221;</i>
However, after passing through the hands of the great and abominable church, whose founder is
the Devil, <i>&#8220;many parts which are plain and most precious; and also many covenants of the
Lord&#8221;</i> were missing. And<i> &#8220;all this have they done that they might . . . blind the eyes and harden
the hearts of the children of men&#8221; </i>(1 Nephi 13: 6, 24-26, 27).</p>
<p>Think of the confusion that has existed throughout dark ages of human history because
plain and precious truths were missing from our precious Bible. For an example, here&#8217;s a little
comparison between the Old Testament and the same period of time covered by the Book of
Mormon. Look at the number of times the first four principles and ordinances of the gospel are
mentioned by name in reference to man&#8217;s salvation in these two books.</p>

<p>Look at that! Faith is mentioned only twice in the Old Testament, repentance three times
and baptism and the word &#8220;Holy Ghost&#8221; never! All four, a total of five times in the Old
Testament compared with 571 times in the B.C. portion of the Book of Mormon alone. Do you
get the idea that someone didn&#8217;t want the gospel message to get out?! Thank goodness that even
with such obvious omissions, these principles are preserved in numerous stories in our priceless
Bible. With the &#8220;labels&#8221; missing, however, the ways of the Lord have been perverted and many
have stumbled as a result (2 Nephi 13:29). Man falters and fails without a good gospel
understanding to guide and protect him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">The Spirit of the Lord is the Food of Our Spirits</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In the last days Amos said there would be a famine in the land, 
		<i>&#8220;not a famine of bread,
nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord&#8221; </i>(Amos 8:11). Doctrine and
Covenants 84:45 says that the word of the Lord <i>is</i> the Spirit of Christ. Our spirits hunger for the
Lord&#8217;s Spirit. As Elder Orson F. Whitney explains, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Spirit of the Lord is the food of our spirits. Without it they would starve . . .
[The Spirit of the Lord] is . . . the fountain of revelation, making known the mind
and will of our Maker. We can only know the things of God by the Spirit of God</i>
(Conference Report, April 1931, pp. 62, 63).</p>
<p>The Lord promises us that the Spirit of God can teach us the truth of all things. If we had
to pay for a tutor who was <i>that smart, that intelligent,</i> we would never be able to afford it. And
the hours he keeps are remarkable. Valiant members covenant every week &#8220;that they are willing
to take upon them the name of [the] son, and always remember him and keep his commandments
that they may <i>ALWAYS</i> have his Spirit to be with them&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenants 20:77,
emphasis added). Even Olympic athletes don&#8217;t get that kind of help from their trainers!</p>
<p>On the other hand, when we fail to keep the commandments Satan plays his &#8220;take away
game&#8221; with our thinking. He takes away truth! (Doctrine and Covenants 93:39). In fact the truth
is taken away until we know nothing concerning the mysteries of God (Alma 12:11). Our agency
gives us the right to choose which spirit we will subject ourselves to but it does not give us the
freedom to not subject ourselves. We are constantly subjecting ourselves to Satan's take away
tactics or the sanctifying power of the Spirit of God by choosing which of the two we will obey
(Alma 3:27).</p>
<p>The Lord set the supreme example when, even in the face of the bitter cup he said,<i>
&#8220;Nevertheless, not my will but thine, be done&#8221; </i>(Luke 22:42). He also allowed himself<i> &#8220;to
become subject unto man in the flesh&#8221; </i>so that man <i>&#8220;might become subject to him&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 9:5).
He merits our total allegiance. Apart from His great atoning sacrifice you and I merit nothing on
our own. Without the perfect atonement, not only would our bodies be <i>&#8220;laid down to rot and
crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more&#8221; </i>but <i>&#8220;our spirits must have become like unto
[Satan]&#8221;</i> and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God,
and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself (2 Nephi 9: 7,9).</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t rocket science, folks. This is simple, straightforward stuff. We alone decide the
thoughts we will think and the course we will take (Moses 6:56). President Kimball said, 
		<i>&#8220;Man
alone, of all creatures of earth, can change his thought pattern and become the architect of his
destiny&#8221;</i> (<i>Miracle of Forgiveness, pp. </i>113-114). Planting a thought in our minds is similar to
sowing a seed in the ground. Plant apple seeds to get apples, seed potatoes to get spuds. And
weeds . . . oh, they&#8217;ll grow on their own. Keep a good weed killer handy, like a hymn or a
favorite scripture. Remember the Spirit of Christ is always more powerful than Satan.</p>
<p>We must actively educate and train our thinking. President McKay often said, 
		<i>&#8220;Sow a
thought, reap an act, Sow an act, reap a habit, Sow a habit, reap a character, Sow a character,
reap an eternal destiny&#8221; </i>(<i>CR, April 1962</i>, p. 7). You&#8217;re in charge. Your thinking is the seed from
which your eternity grows. Ask yourself, what are you thinking? Instead of thinking life&#8217;s
impossible, think gospel truth, <i>&#8220;With God nothing shall be impossible&#8221;</i> (Luke 1:37); Instead of,
&#8220;I can't do it,&#8221; think gospel truth,<i> &#8220;I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me&#8221;
		</i>(Philippians 4:13). The list goes on. President McKay <i>&#8220;plead with members of the Church, and
with people everywhere, to think more about the gospel&#8221; </i>(<i>CR, April 1968</i>, p. 144).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">The Lord Changes Us By Changing Our Thoughts</span></p>
<p>The Lord works by small and simple means. When men are willing He can help them
alter little thoughts and thereby make big changes Think of the thoughts that changed in the mind
of a teenage Joseph when he knelt to pray in the spring of 1820. Think of the sanctifying change
those thoughts, and others that followed, have created in the lives of millions of men, women and
children the world over.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>President Benson contrasts the miraculous way the Lord changes people with the way the
world tries to change them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The
world would take people out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of people,
and then they take themselves out of the slums. The world would mold men by
changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their
environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change
human nature </i>(Born of God, Tambuli, Oct. 1989, 2).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>President McKay tells us how it will happen. It

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>will be accomplished only by a slow but never process of changing men's mental
and spiritual attitude. The ways and habits of the world depend upon the thoughts
and soul of men and women. If, therefore, we would change the world, we must
first change people's thoughts . . . </i>(Conference Report, October 1964, p. 5).</p>
<p>When we began I told you that great stories have a way of portraying great truths. The
greatest story ever told is the God-story, the gospel of Jesus Christ. By letting its truths guide our
thinking we can succeed in understanding what Brigham Young called <i>&#8220;The greatest mystery a
man ever learned.&#8221; </i>He said that <i>&#8220;the greatest mystery a man ever learned, is to know how to
control the human mind&#8221; </i>(Journal of Discourses, 26 vols. [London: Latter-day Saint Book
Depot, 1854-86], 1:46). With Gospel thinking and the deeds that flow from it, &#8220;Murphy&#8217;s mortal
moments&#8221; <i>&#8220;and all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good&#8221;</i>
(Doctrine and Covenants 98:3), in your transition from manhood to Godhood. God lives, he
loves you, President Gordon B. Hinckley is his prophet on earth today. The Church is true and
families can be forever. Of this I bear testimony.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, it&#8217;s wonderful to be with you.  I love my students at Harvard, but they don&#8217;t
bring the Spirit with them into the classroom as you have done today.  I wish there were a way
for them to do it because we would learn so much more together if they had the wisdom to have
the Spirit with them.  I had prepared a talk, which I thought was going to be a good talk for you. 
Then yesterday, as I flew out and tried to prayerfully think through how to deliver that talk, it
became apparent that I had prepared the wrong talk. So I have put something together, and I
hope that whoever you are, for whom this talk was intended, that I can do a good job for you.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I decided that I wanted to just recount for you five decisions that I made when I was a young
adult that in retrospect have had a profound influence on my life, because these are decisions that
I think many of you will find yourself needing to make, and maybe, if I can talk through with
you how I wrestled with and made those decisions, it might help you think through a similar
problem if it arises in your life.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The first decision for which I am very grateful is the decision I made when I was very young that
I was going to get the best education possible.  Where this excitement came from was my
wonderful mother. I remember her teaching me when I was 16 years old the image that we as
members of the church were like clay in the hands of the potter. And I rememeber her teaching
me that &#8220;the more you learn, Clayton, the more talents that you develop, the more ways God can
shape you to be useful in building his kingdom.&#8221;  That really stuck with me. I remember going as
a freshman to BYU and just like being a kid in a candy store, looking at that course catalog and
reading about all these interesting courses, and I wanted to take every one. I enrolled my first
year in Oriental Mythology, Economic Geography, Black History, and a number of more main-stream topics and loved every one of them. I think I loved them because a primary motivation for
my learning was that there was a cause in which I was enrolled as a BYU student that was far
greater than my personal cause, and I can testify that every calling I have had in the church, in
every one of those callings, the things that I&#8217;ve learned about arts and history and literature and
science and management have helped me to magnify that calling, and I am very grateful that I
made a decision to pursue education as deeply as I possibly could.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The second decision for which I am grateful is the decision I made to learn if the Book of
Mormon is true. President Bednar mentioned that when I finished at BYU I received a
scholarship to go to Oxford University in England. When I arrived at Oxford it was very clear
that it was going to be inconvenient to be a Mormon in Oxford. The Rhodes Scholarship Trust
that had given me my scholarship had a lot of activities for the recipients of the scholarship, and
if I was going to be active in the church it would be difficult for me to participate in those
activities. I realized, as I thought through the extent to which I wanted to be involved in the
church, that, you know, I didn&#8217;t even know that the Book of Mormon was true. I had read the
Book of Mormon, until that point, seven times in my life, and in each of the seven times I had
gotten to the end of the book and had knelt in prayer and had asked God to tell me if it was true,
and I had gotten no answer. And I realized, as I thought through why I hadn&#8217;t gotten an answer,
that each of the previous seven times, I had read it on an assignment, either from my parents or a
BYU instructor or my mission president or a seminary teacher, and my objective was to finish
the book. But this time I just desperately needed to know for myself if the Book of Mormon was
true. To that point in my life I had sustained myself on a belief in many of the doctrines of the
church and in the trust of my parents because I knew they knew it was true, and I trusted my
parents. But finally when I arrived at Oxford, for the first time in my life I just desperately
needed to know if it was true</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Some of you who have seen pictures of Oxford may know that it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s oldest university.
The building that I lived in was built in 1410-beautiful to look at, horrible to live in. It just had a
little heater that they had dug out of the stone wall and had inserted there. I decided that I would
commit every evening from 11 to 12 o&#8217;clock to reading the Book of Mormon to find out if it was
true. I wondered if I dared spend that much time, because I was in a very demanding academic
program, studying applied econometrics, and I was going to try to finish the program in two
years, whereas most of the people in the program finished it in three, and I just didn&#8217;t know if I
could afford allocating an hour a day to this effort. But nonetheless I did, and I began at 11:00 by
kneeling in prayer by the chair by that heater, and I prayed out loud. I told God how desperate I
was to find out if this was a true book, and I told Him that if He would reveal to me that it was
true, that I then intended to dedicate my life to building this kingdom. And I told Him if it wasn&#8217;t
true that I needed to know that for certain, too, because then I would dedicate my life to finding
out what was true. Then I would sit in the chair, and I read the first page of the Book of Mormon,
and when I got down to the bottom of the page, I stopped, and I thought about what I had read on
that page, and I asked myself, &#8220;Could this have been written by a Charlatan who was trying to
deceive people, or was this really written by a prophet of God?  And what did it mean for me in
my life?&#8221;  And then I put the book down and knelt in prayer and verbally asked God again,
&#8220;Please tell me if this is a true book.&#8221;  Then I would sit in the chair and pick up the book and turn
the page and read another page, pause at the bottom, and do the same thing. I did this for an hour
every night, night after night in that cold, damp room, at the Queen&#8217;s College Oxford.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">By the time I got to the chapters at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> Nephi, one evening when I said my prayer and
sat in my chair and opened the book, all of a sudden there came into that room a beautiful, warm,
loving spirit that just surrounded me and permeated my soul, and enveloped me in a feeling of
love that I just had not imagined I could feel. And I began to cry, and I didn&#8217;t want to stop crying
because as I looked through my tears at the words in the Book of Mormon, I could see truth in
those words that I never imagined I could comprehend before. And I could see the glories of
eternity and I could see what God had in store for me as one of His sons. And I didn&#8217;t want to
stop crying. That spirit stayed with me the whole hour, and then every evening as I prayed and
sat with the Book of Mormon by the fireplace in my room, that same spirit returned and it
changed my heart and my life forever.<br /></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I look back in the conflict that I experienced, wondering whether I could afford to spend an hour
everyday apart from the study of applied econometrics to find if the Book of Mormon was true,
and you know, I use applied econometrics maybe once a year, but I use my knowledge that the
Book of Mormon is the word of God many times every day of my life. In all of the education
that I have pursued, that is the single most useful piece of knowledge that I ever gained.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">I love to return to Oxford. Most of the people there are either students or they&#8217;re tourists who
have come to look at a beautiful university. But I love to return there because it&#8217;s a sacred place,
and I can look at the windows of that room where I lived, and I think that that&#8217;s the place that I
learned that Jesus is the Christ, that he is my living Redeemer, and that Joseph Smith was the
prophet of the restoration for the true church. I just wanted to tell this to you because some of
you probably came here to Rexburg already having learned for yourself that this is God&#8217;s church.
But for those of you that may still be living on the testimony of others, I invite you to set aside
an hour everyday and find out for yourself if this is true, because it will change your heart as it
has changed mine. And someday you&#8217;ll be able to come back here to Rexburg, and whereas
other people are here for many different reasons, you&#8217;ll be able to go to the place where you
lived at the time that God revealed this to you, and point at it to your children and your spouse,
and say &#8220;That&#8217;s a sacred place because that&#8217;s where I learned that Jesus is the Christ.&#8221;</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The third decision that I made for which I am very grateful was a decision that also happened to
me at that time. The bishop of the Oxford ward then called me to be the young men&#8217;s president.
We had 48 young men in the Oxford ward, only one of whom was active. I had no idea how I
was going to carry on my course of study and do anything near a capable job as a young men&#8217;s
president. But what I decided to do is that I would get up every morning at 7:00 a.m. and focus
on applied econometrics until 6:00 p.m., and then thereafter I would focus on being a Young
Men&#8217;s President. In the midst of this, I learned that my father was dieing of cancer, and I
dropped out of school for a time to come back home and take care of him until he passed away.
When I got back, that meant that I even had less time to try to finish a very ambitious degree,
and I thought to myself, &#8216;Maybe I&#8217;d better ask the bishop to release me because it would just
take too much time away from my study.&#8217;  But then I thought, &#8216;No, if I know the Book of
Mormon is true, then I better do what it says,&#8217; and it had told me in 3 Nephi 13:33 that I should
seek first the kingdom of God in His righteousness and all these things would be added unto me.
And so that&#8217;s what I did. I bought a bicycle, and every night from six to nine, I rode around the
streets of Oxford looking up these 47 inactive young men, inviting them to join us at church, and
ultimately six of them did.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We met (the Oxford ward did) in a meeting room in the top of a pub. If Lucifer had picked our
meeting spot, he couldn&#8217;t have done better. The only place for the Aaronic priesthood to meet
was at the top landing of the back staircase where they stored the kegs of Guinness ale. And so
we arranged the kegs in a semi-circle every Sunday and sat on the kegs. I fasted every Sunday
that somehow the Lord would bring into that awful environment a wonderful spirit that would
touch these young men&#8217;s hearts, and it did. All six of those young men served missions. But it
was a big bite out of my studies, and as the time for my final exams arrived, I was really worried
that I might not be able to pass, because in the Oxford system there aren&#8217;t any courses that you
take. You just continuously study your subject and at the very end of the course you have to take
a big, long, four day, 32 hour examination where you have to put it out all on paper. My tutor
told me that I wasn&#8217;t prepared, that I better wait and graduate the next year, but I knew that if I
had gone and done the things that the Lord commanded that he would open a way for me to pass
the test. So I fasted and prayed and told the Lord I had two months left. I needed to know what
questions the examiners were going to ask so that I could study the questions and pass the exam.
I then prayerfully went to the library and put myself in the examiners shoes, and thought about,
&#8216;If I wanted to really skewer Clayton Christensen, what questions and curve balls would I throw
at him on this exam?&#8217;  Then for two months I studied to know the answers to those questions.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The night before the exam, I went off to one of the meadows at Oxford and knelt in prayer, and I
poured my heart out to the Lord, and I recounted how hard I had worked to study economics, and
how hard I had worked to magnify my calling as the Young Men&#8217;s President. And I plead with
Him that He would bless me. And the next day, as I opened the exams, every one of the
questions that the examiners threw at me was a question that I had come to know that they would
ask. And the lesson that I learned from this is that when Heavenly Father invited us to seek first
the kingdom of God, and promises us that all these other things will be added to us that He was
dead serious. That is a promise that we can bank on. And I incite you, my brothers and sisters,
that when you find yourself confronted with a conflict between the pursuit of a career and the
pursuit of magnifying your calling in the kingdom of God, that if you will believe God, and trust
in Him, He will bless you in ways that are beyond your comprehension.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The fourth decision I made for which I am very grateful was also one that I made when I was at
Oxford. You may have noticed how high they had to raise this podium - I am 6'8", and when you
are tall you don&#8217;t have to be very good to play basketball. So I tried out for and made the Oxford
Varsity basketball team. We had a great team. Those guys were the best friends that I&#8217;ve ever
known in my life, and we went through the regular season and were undefeated. Then we went
into the British equivalent of what we would call here the NCAA basketball tournament. We
marched through each of those games in a fairly easy fashion until we came to the final four, and
then kind of cluelessly I looked at the schedule to find out when the games were scheduled, and
to my horror saw that the final basketball game was scheduled to be played on Sunday in Bristol.
And I was devastated because I had made a commitment to myself when I was 16 that I would
never play basketball on Sunday. I went to the coach truly conflicted because these guys, we had
worked our guts out all season long and I was the starting center, and the guys on the team were
the best friends that I&#8217;ve ever had in my whole life and I needed to help them win this goal that
we had all practiced for. And yet I&#8217;d made this commitment to Heavenly Father. So I told my
coach about this conflict and asked him what I should do. And he was just incredulous. He said,
&#8220;We have worked so hard for this. I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re even asking.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
who your god is, but mine, let me tell you what he&#8217;s like. He lets us by on things like this. And
Clay, just this once, just this once, play this game and then go off and do whatever you have to
do with your god and make peace with him and never do it again.&#8221;<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Well, then we played in the semi-final game, and my friend who was the back-up center got up-ended on a rebound and fell down on his shoulder and dislocated his shoulder, which then
increased the pressure for me to play that game. So I went back into my hotel room after that
game and knelt down and asked Heavenly Father if it would be all right, just this once, if I
played that game on Sunday. As I started my prayer, really before I could even utter a word,
Heavenly Father put a full-sentence answer in my mind, and it was &#8220;Clayton, what are you even
asking me for?  You know the answer.&#8221;  I sat up on the bed and looked at the door and I said,
&#8220;You&#8217;re right, I know the answer.&#8221;  So I went to my coach and I told him how sorry I was, but I
just couldn&#8217;t play on Sunday. Then I went to the Bristol ward meetings that day, and prayed that
God would bless my teammates that they would win, and they did, which means, I guess, I
wasn&#8217;t that important to the team. But you know, as time has passed, and that was a decision I
made now almost 30 years ago, it looms as one of the most important decisions I have ever made
because it would have been very easy to say, in general, keeping the Sabbath day holy is the
right commandment, but in my particular extenuating circumstances, it&#8217;s okay, just this once, if I
don&#8217;t do it. And the reason that decision has proven so important to me is that my whole life has
turned out to be an un-ending stream of extenuating circumstances, and had I crossed that line
just that once, then the next time something came up that was so demanding and critical, it would
have been so much easier to cross the line again. And when I have been subsequently confronted
with opportunities to look at pornography or not pay my tithing, or compromise on others of
God&#8217;s commandments, this lesson that I learned has been very important. The lesson is it really
is easier to keep the commandments 100 percent of the time than it is 98 percent of the time. If I
could paraphrase Alma 34:34, that same spirit that possesses our souls before something &#8220;just
this once,&#8221; possesses our souls after we do it as well, and if we do it just this once, doing it again
becomes so much easier. And that&#8217;s why that decision has loomed to be so important in my life,
and I am grateful that I drew the line in a safe place, and never crossed it.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The fifth decision that I wanted to recount for you, was the decision I made to call myself on a
mission again. I served a wonderful mission in Korea. As I mentioned I did most of it only being
able to say that I believed the Book of Mormon was true, and I testified of those things that I
knew to be true, and I felt the Spirit with me almost everyday when I was a missionary. But
when I returned I began to feel the Spirit less and less as my life progressed. We moved to
Boston and I enrolled in the MBA program at Harvard, and I was called at the time to serve as a
counselor to our bishop, and I was a busy guy. I just did everything I could to magnify my
calling. I was studying the scriptures everyday, I was praying, and yet on a day to day basis it
just seemed like I was feeling the Spirit less and less as time wore on. And I yearned to have the
same spirit return to me that I had felt when I was a missionary, and yet it didn&#8217;t seem like any of
the usual levers of magnifying my calling or study or prayer brought the same spirit back into my
heart</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Then we moved to Washington and I had the chance to take a job in the Reagan Administration.
All of a sudden we were living with new people and I was working with new people and I was
riding in on the bus with new people, and it gave me many more opportunities than I had had
living in a stable situation in Boston to begin talking with people about my church. Some of
those opportunities then resulted in deeper opportunities to discuss the gospel, and I then invited
one of my co-workers to come to our home with her boyfriend to hear the missionary
discussions. I remember it was a Sunday afternoon, and my wife and I were scrambling around
trying to clean up the living room before they and the missionaries arrived and I put on a cassette
tape of the Mormon Youth Symphony and Chorus in our stereo, and they were singing &#8220;The
Spirit of God,&#8221; like a fire is burning. They came to the third verse where they sang 
		<i>&#8220;We&#8217;ll call in
our solemn assemblies in spirit/ To spread forth the kingdom of heaven abroad/ That we by our
faith may begin to inherit/ The visions and blessings and glories of God&#8221; 
		</i>(<i>Hymns</i>, 2).  As they
sang those words, I felt a beautiful spirit again come into the room and into my heart, and I
realized that as I had begun working again to spread for the Kingdom of Heaven abroad as a
member missionary, that the visions and blessings and glories of God had returned to my life. I
was dreaming spiritual dreams and thinking happy, spiritual thoughts as I walked to the bus in
the morning, and joy had come back into my heart, just as it had been there when I was a
missionary.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This is what I realized: Just imagine that you&#8217;re the general of an army, and you&#8217;ve got some
state-of-the-art-weapons, and you&#8217;ve got to decide which of your soldiers you&#8217;re going to give
these state-of-the-art weapons to. You&#8217;ll give your best weapons to those soldiers who are right
in the front line, engaged in direct combat with the enemy. Those soldiers who are operating
behind the front lines, who are driving the supply trucks and cooking the soup and keeping the
records, they won&#8217;t need the state-of-the-art weapons because they never really confront the
enemy, per say. I realized what had happened to me is I had been released from my mission and
had begun engaging in service in the church as a member that most of my assignments were in
fact administrative in character, and as they were administrative in character, plain old Clay
Christensen, with his plain old talents, was perfectly capable of doing most of the assignments
that I was given as an administrator in the Church. But when I made that decision to become
again a missionary for the Lord Jesus Christ, it was as if geographically I repositioned myself
right on the front line, engaged in direct combat with Satan in this vicious war that he is waging
over the souls of the children of men.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It turns out that missionary work is an assignment in the church at which we cannot succeed if
we don&#8217;t have the Spirit with us at all times. And I am so grateful that I came to make that
decision to be a missionary again because it has blessed our family in profound ways. The next
year, 1984, I was listening to General Conference, and Elder M. Russell Ballard gave a talk at
that time where he invited us as members of the church to set a date, a point in the future, as a
commitment to our Heavenly Father. He invited us-don&#8217;t pick a person that we were going to
share the gospel with but to set a date. He promised us that if we would do all that we could to
engage in conversations about the gospel, with as many people as we could, that God would
bless us by that date, that we would intersect with somebody who would accept our invitation to
meet with the missionaries. His talk just sunk into my heart. That night I went home and knelt by
my bed and committed to my Heavenly Father that by a date I would find somebody for the
missionaries to teach. That was in 1984. That year, by the date, Heavenly Father blessed me to
find a man who we could bring into our home to teach with the missionaries. I have set a date
once, twice and now three times every year as a commitment to my Heavenly Father that I&#8217;m
going to be a missionary, and every Sunday I fast that God will help me to intersect with
somebody who I can invite to learn of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Every time I pray, I pray that
God will put somebody in my path, and I&#8217;m grateful to be able to say that God has answered my
prayer every time. It&#8217;s been 20 years.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">This last Sunday, we had probably the best first discussion that I&#8217;ve ever participated in, taught
to one of my wonderful students, a young man from France named Guillaume. On the last day of
my class, which is taught to the second year students in our MBA program, I describe for the
students how all semester long we&#8217;ve been studying about these companies and goals and
strategies for achieving these goals, and yet in the way that they invest their money on a day to
day and a year to year basis, they tend to invest in things that offer the shortest term payback. 
That pattern of directing their investment decisions often causes companies that could be very
successful in the pursuit of a lofty strategy actually to lead themselves toward failure. And I told
my students, &#8220;You know, now you are graduating from the Harvard Business School. And a lot
of you in your personal lives are going to do the same thing.&#8221;  I told them that &#8220;none of you have
a strategy to leave here and go get divorced, and raise children who are alienated from you and
become unhappy people, but that is actually the strategy that many of you are going to
implement, because as you have opportunities to spend your time and energy, your very likely to
spend them in pursuit of career success because it offers them most immediate and tangible
evidence of achievement.&#8221; And I invite them not to do that, but I tell them, &#8220;but in order for you
to figure out how you&#8217;ve got to spend your time and your energy, you need to figure out what the
purpose of your life is.&#8221; Then this year I told them about the experience that I had had dedicating
an hour everyday when I was a student at Oxford to figuring out what the purpose of my life
was. And I invited them to do the same thing.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">A couple of days later I got an email from Guillaume, and he said, &#8220;Professor Christensen, I&#8217;ve
been thinking about it and I don&#8217;t know what the purpose of my life is. Will you help me?  He
came in and as we talked he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to spend an hour a day; I just don&#8217;t know what to
read.&#8221; I was able to give him my copy of the Book of Mormon, and invite him to take the
missionary discussions. And I was so grateful this Sunday to be able to testify to him that of all
the things that I taught him in our class, the things we were teaching him that day were the most
important. I was so grateful to be able to tell him that he is a son of God, and that there really is a
purpose for him coming here.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sharing the gospel has allowed me to feel the Spirit in my life more profoundly and more
consistently than anything else that I&#8217;ve done. And I invite you. Some of you have served
missions, some of you are anticipating a call, some of you may not go on missions because of
other callings that you have, but I invite all of you to be member missionaries. If you can live
your life positioned squarely on the front line engaged in hand to hand combat with Satan over
the souls of the children of men, there is no way you can succeed in that calling if you don&#8217;t have
the Spirit of God with you every day. It will be a great blessing to you. Don&#8217;t let yourself only
engage in administrative work in this church. It&#8217;ll have a profound influence on your family.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Several years ago another one of my students accepted my invitation to come and meet with the
missionaries. The missionaries, during the second discussion, just did a marvelous job. And at
the end of the discussion they bore their testimonies to Sunil, and then I bore mine and my wife
Christine bore her testimony, and then I called on one of the missionaries to give the closing
prayer, and our 11 year old son Spencer had been sitting over on the piano bench listening to the
discussion. He raised his hand and stood up and he said, Dad, could you wait a minute?  I have
something to say. And I still remember that beautiful clear look in Spencer&#8217;s eyes as he looked at
Sunil and he said, Sunil, &#8220;I am only an 11-year-old boy, but I want you to know that I know that
the things that the missionaries taught you today are true. I know that God lives and that you are
His son.&#8221; And he closed his testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. As Spence bore that
testimony, that beautiful spirit came into the room again, and I started to cry, right there in front
of my student. The next day Sunil sent me an email and he thanked me for arranging the
missionaries to teach and he complimented them on how clear the lessons were, and he said,
&#8220;But you know, when your son Spencer stood up and said those things, I felt something come
into the room. Is that what you mean when you say the Spirit of God?&#8221;  I thought to myself, &#8216;I&#8217;d
pay a million dollars to give my son an experience half that good.&#8217; It really has been a wonderful
decision we made to be missionaries.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">So these are the decisions that I hope you will make correctly too. Make a decision to get the
best possible education that you can because it will give you so many more opportunities to be
shaped by the hand of God, to serve competently in many different ways in building His
kingdom. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Second, the most valuable thing you can learn as you pursue your education is to find out for
yourself that the Book of Mormon is the word of God.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Third, when you have opportunities to serve in the Kingdom of God, 
		<i>&#8220;seek ye first the kingdom
of God and His righteousness&#8221;</i> (3 Nephi 13:33) with confidence that other things will be added
to you as they are necessary.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Fourth, whenever you are tempted, &#8220;just this once,&#8221; to cross a line on something God asked you
to do, please remember, brothers and sisters, it is much easier to keep the commandments 100
percent of the time than it is 98 percent of the time.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Then finally, call yourself on a mission, because it will bring the Spirit into your home in a way
that almost nothing else can.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A couple of years ago I got assigned to serve for five years as an area authority seventy and it
really is an assignment to travel around the northeastern part of North America and at every
opportunity bear my testimony that Jesus is the Christ. I would like to close my remarks to you
today by bearing that testimony to you. When I received the assignment and was told that I
needed to be able to bear a sure testimony that Christ lives, I&#8217;m not sure I knew that I knew what
sure was. But as I have sought to be able to magnify my calling and have sought to know Jesus
Christ, I can stand before you today and testify that I know with assuredly that Jesus Christ is the
Son of God, that he lives. I know of assuredly that he knows every one of you. He has already
suffered for all of the sins of everyone you meet and he is so desperate, because he loves them so
much, to be able to forgive them of their sins. And yet he can&#8217;t do it unless we as servants of his
give people the opportunity to accept him. I know that he is so grateful for everything you do
that gives people the opportunity to accept his love and his sacrifice and his atonement which he
has given in their behalf. I testify that He lives, and I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, 
		amen.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">When Joseph Smith emerged from the grove in 1820, he had learned first hand from
Jesus Christ himself that the Christian churches of his day were all wrong, and that he was
forbidden to join any of them. <i>&#8220;Their creeds were an abomination in his sight,&#8221; 
		</i>their
<i>&#8220;professors were all corrupt,&#8221;</i> and they were teaching <i>&#8220;for doctrines the commandments of men,
having a form of godliness,&#8221; </i>but denying <i>&#8220;the power thereof&#8221; 
		</i>(Joseph Smith 2:19).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">By the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, LDS scholars and leaders had entered a new phase by
turning to the findings of modern historians in an attempt to expand their understanding of the
apostasy. Protestant historians, who focused on the failings of the Catholic tradition, provided
seemingly endless evidences of apostasy in Christian history, justifying the Protestant
reformation in the process. They pointed to the obvious wickedness of late medieval popes and
priests. They pointed to the sales of indulgences by which the Church was raising money by
selling forgiveness of sins in this world to prevent punishment in the next. Guided by these 18<sup>th</sup>
and 19<sup>th</sup> century Protestant historians, LDS writers pushed the apostasy further back in time by
focusing on the sins of medieval Christianity.</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Over the last century there has been an outpouring of rediscovered manuscripts, written
during the first Christian centuries, that enable us to get a much clearer picture of what the
Christian experience was like in those early times. And as our knowledge of these times grows,
the apostasy is again pushed back further, even into the first century. Hugh Nibley was the first
LDS author to enter this third phase. He located the apostasy in the later decades of the very first
century, from which almost no writings survived. Using a stage metaphor, he calls it the years
&#8220;when the lights went out.&#8221; And when they came back on at the end of the century, he said, the
furniture had all been moved around. But because there are no surviving documents from this
period, we don&#8217;t know how that happened.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Greek term 
		<i>apostasia</i>, as used in the <i>New Testament</i>, means rebellion. It was often
used in classical Greek to indicate a military rebellion or coup. Thus, <i>apostasia 
		</i>specifically
refers to internal problems. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young both recognized this when they
said that no force on this earth could destroy the Church from without. In so doing they were
echoing the principle articulated by the angel who appeared to young Alma saying: 
		<i>&#8220;Alma, arise
and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God? For the Lord hath said:
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">This is my
church</span>, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my
people&#8221;</i> (Mosiah 27:13, emphasis added).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">You&#8217;ve all brought your scriptures today. I am going to give you a reward and throw in a
scripture that is too long to read to you without your reading along. Look in Mosiah 2. This is
earlier in the same book that I&#8217;ve just been quoting. I want to read with you verses 36 and 37.
This comes from the famous address, the final farewell address of King Benjamin to his people.
King Benjamin is teaching his people about apoastasy and and about faithfullness in the gospel
of Jesus Christ.</font></p>

prospered, and preserved - I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same
cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey the evil
spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no

themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The word used here is <i>apostasion</i>, meaning &#8220;little rebellion&#8221; or &#8220;little apostasy,&#8221; and specifically
indicates divorce, or breaking of the marriage covenant. The Lord repeatedly likened his
covenant with Israel to the covenant of marriage, and apostasy from that covenant was likened to
adultery. We might expect, therefore, that the demise of the early Christian church also was a
result of internal developments&#8212;breaking of covenants&#8212;and not something imposed from the
outside.</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">LDS scholars today conclude increasingly that the root causes of the apostasy were the
breaking of sacred covenants by the Christians themselves. The more we learn about the first
decades after the passing of Christ, the more we can see internal rebellion against God&#8217;s
covenants and against his authorized servant&#8212;much like the rebellions against Moses in the
wilderness, or like those against Joseph Smith in Kirtland in 1836. The rebels were members of
Christ&#8217;s church, sometimes leaders, who sought for earthly power, glory, and even justification
for their own sins. The Restoration scriptures give us some key insights: The first section of the<i>
Doctrine and Covenants </i>says,</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>they have strayed from mine ordinances, and 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">have broken mine everlasting
covenant</span>; They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man
walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the
likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old
and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall</i> (D&amp;C 1:15-16, emphasis added).</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Thus the Lord describes this apostasy as breaking covenants and straying from His
ordinances. The Lord likewise says concerning his disciples during his earthly ministry, 
		<i>&#8220;My
disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in
their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants
64:8). Thus, we see that apostasy involves breaking God&#8217;s covenants, turning from Him to idols
and things of this world, and also not repenting of our sins, which is of course the most
fundamental thing we have covenanted to do.</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">New research by several LDS scholars in different fields is helping us understand the
apostasy better. Their work has identified several common myths and misconceptions that
Latter-day Saints have about the apostasy, and helps us understand the falling away from the true
church more accurately and completely. I will argue that the Christian apostasy occurred
sometime during the first century&#8212;or before 100 
		<span style="font-variant: small-caps">c.e. </span>Traditional Christianity, as we know it,
was not established until the Nicene Council in 325 
		<span style="font-variant: small-caps">c.e.</span> or during the fourth century.</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<font color="#000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Myth #1: The Apostasy happened because of outside persecution</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Both the Bible and the writings of early Christians extensively document internal
divisions that were a major problem within the church. Paul&#8217;s first epistle to the church in
Corinth details several schismatic developments in the Corinthian branch:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the
house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. Now this I say, that every
one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of
Paul?</i> (1 Corinthians 1:11-13)</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Paul marvels at how quickly the Galatian Saints have &#8220;turned from the gospel&#8221; (Galatians 1:6-8).
Paul&#8217;s second epistle to the church in Corinth mentions false apostles whom Paul describes as
&#8220;ministers of Satan&#8221; (2 Corinthians 11:13-15). In his second epistle to Timothy, Paul says that<i>
&#8220;all Asia is turned away&#8221;</i> (2 Timothy 1:15). In his letter to Gaius, John reports that in one
unnamed branch of the church, the leader Diotrophes, will have nothing to do with John and his
brethren. Not only does he refuse to accept John and his emissaries, but he opposes those who do
want to accept them and &#8220;puts them out of the church&#8221; (3 John 1:9-10). In the book of
Revelation, John writes inspired letters to seven of the churches in Asia, calling them to
repentance for the most egregious of sins (Revelation 2&#8211;3). Any stake president or bishop
receiving one of these letters today would know that he and his members were way out of line
and probably scheduled for church disciplinary action.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">These kinds of divisions and internal problems are not unknown to Latter-day Saints.
Think of the Kirtland period and the rampant and recurring apostasy and opposition to Joseph
Smith&#8217;s leadership. In many ways, the early Christian church seems never to have transcended
its &#8220;Kirtland period.&#8221; The Latter-day restoration did transcend these early apostasies by the
strength of its prophet and the loyal apostles that stood with him before and after his death. Two
weeks ago, President Hinckley was in England and told how the church was in deep trouble in
Kirtland, and then again in Nauvoo. He then explained how the flood of faithful new converts
from England was crucial in helping the Church to survive those crises. Since those difficult
days, the Church has benefited from higher and higher levels of unity and loyalty among its
members, so that today we can hardly understand the challenges of internal strife that
characterized much of our early Church history.</font></p>

<font color="#000080"><i>No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage,

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">The world in which Jesus established his church was full of pagan superstitions and
excesses. But the educated and ruling classes of the Roman empire&#8212;who had been thoroughly
hellenized in earlier centuries&#8212;put their trust in the teachings of the Greek philosophers who
discouraged religious superstition and challenged men to become virtuous by living up to
universally recognized standards of good human conduct. While the Christians could agree
generally with that stance, they could not accept the philosophers&#8217; rejection of the gods or claims
to be able to make men good through their own self discipline alone. The Christians recognized
that without the atonement of Jesus Christ and the guiding and purifying effect of the Spirit in
their lives, men could not become truly good. Paul warned the saints: &#8220;See to it that no one takes
you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and
the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ&#8221; (Colossians 2:8). This, however, is the
only explicit reference to philosophy in the <i>New Testament</i>, suggesting that it was far from being
his major concern with the first-century saints.</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">During the third century, however, in the city of Alexandria, Egypt, a new way of using
Greek philosophy arose. Men like Clement of Alexandria, his star pupil Origen, and later
Athanasius began to use elements of Greek philosophy to articulate and develop Christian
doctrine. Origen, who died in 254 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">c.e.</span>, wrote 
		<i>&#8220;Perchance, too, philosophy was given to the
Greek directly and primarily, till the Lord should call the Greek. For this was a schoolmaster to
bring &#8216;the Hellenic mind,&#8217; as the [law of Moses brought] the Hebrews, &#8216;to Christ&#8217;&#8221;
		</i>(<i>Miscellanies </i>1.5.28). Philosophy and reason were not superior to revelation for Clement and
Origen, but they did provide another fully reliable source of truth. For them, the Greek
philosophical tradition was a rich resource for all who wanted to defend, establish, or develop
Christian doctrine. The result of such efforts over the following centuries was a new Christianity
that had been thoroughly hellenized.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">But, already in apostasy, the third-century Christians were in deep trouble. Official
persecutions were increasing. They were plagued by a rapidly multiplying diversity of Christian
doctrines and sects&#8212;each claiming to be the true heirs of Christ and the apostles. There was no
central leadership to help them distinguish between the true and the false. They needed some
universal standard and authority to which they could agree and by which they could divide true
and false Christianity&#8212;the orthodox from the heretical. Threatened with the utter demise of
Christianity, they turned to the well established and widely admired principles of Greek
philosophy for a solution. Even Protestant historians, who used to criticize the hellenization of
the early churches, now recognize would have dwindled into an insignificant folk religion
without the infusion of Greek thought.  Soon, the third-century Christian thinkers came to share
Clement&#8217;s appreciation for the work of Plato and his successors. They even went so far as to
claim that God had sent the Greeks to prepare the systems of thought that would bring
Christianity to its divinely intended completion. The fulness of Christian doctrine and
understanding could only occur as the teachings of Christ and the apostles were united with the
teachings of Plato and the other Greek philosophers. The Nicene Council of 325
		<span style="font-variant: small-caps">c.e.</span> and other
later councils officially incorporated this approach and issued creeds that have been used to
distinguish the orthodox from the heretical from that day to this. And this is why the Christian
world today is not willing to see the Latter-day Saints-or any other believers in Christ who refuse
to accept the creeds of the councils-as Christians.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">These are declarations of fact, knowledge, and eye-witness accounts. They say that they have
seen and heard and they bear testimony. Compare these to the philosophical declaration that the
Church produced in the fourth century. The Athanasian creed focuses on the definition of the
nature of God: &#8220; the Son of God, is God and man; God, of the substance of the Father, begotten
before the worlds; and man of the substance of his mother, born in the world; perfect God and
perfect man, of a rational soul and human flesh subsisting.&#8221; Though the incorporation of Greek
philosophy into Christianity was not an original cause of the apostasy, the apostate Christian
churches generally reached out to embrace philosophy as a means of bringing common standards
and rationality to Christian belief. It is widely recognized today by Christian historians that they
saved the Christian tradition by doing so.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<font color="#000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Myth 3: The Roman Catholic church specifically is the great and abominable church spoken of
in Nephi&#8217;s vision</span>.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Given the dependence of the early LDS writers on Protestant historians, who were
themselves often anti-Catholic, it is not surprising that Latter-day Saints tended to interpret
Nephi&#8217;s vision in this way. The Protestant emphasis on the corruption in medieval Christianity
naturally suggested the Catholic Church as the church of the devil described by Nephi in his
vision. But if we look more closely at these scriptures, we will see that the church of the devil
arose centuries before the Catholic Church was established as such, and we will see that it
includes much more than just one such organization. There is much more to it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">In the vision recorded in 1 Nephi 13, Nephi saw that the great and abominable church
was formed in the first century when the record of the Jews went forth from the Jews to the
Gentiles (v 25-26) and that it was founded in opposition to the Church of God (v. 5), which tells
us that the two existed simultaneously. Nephi saw further that the devil&#8217;s church took away
many parts of the gospel, including the covenants, as verse 26 tells us, and later took away many
precious things out of the Bible (v. 28). Now, in the first century, the Christian scriptures
consisted principally of the <i>Old Testament</i>, available principally in a Greek translation, called the
		<i>Septuagint</i>. A few years ago I had a personal experience that confirmed Nephi&#8217;s account in a
dramatic way. I was a guest of the director of the Vatican Library in Rome, and he brought out
their fourth century copy of the complete Bible for me to see&#8212;<i>Codex Vaticanus B</i>. The first
page we looked at had numerous erasures, additions, and changes written right on the page in
different inks and different hands! I asked, pointing to some of these, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; The reply:
&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s where they made corrections.&#8221; Over the last two decades, many 
		<i>New Testament</i>
scholars have argued convincingly that the final texts of the gospels and the epistles that were
eventually canonized, took shape during a long period in which they were modified as necessary
to support the emerging theological orthodoxy among the leaders of the Christian churches.
Their principal evidence comes from scriptural quotations in second century documents which
are different and which would not have supported the theological orthodoxy that emerged later.</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Nor did this process of change go unnoticed in those early centuries. Paul warned the
Thessalonians that some people might try to stir them up with false letters addressed from the
apostles. Peter said that many in his day were &#8220;wresting&#8221; the scriptures, or distorting their true
meaning (2 Pet 3:15-16). Ignatius of Antioch, a bishop who was martyred around 110 AD said
that he could not write down all of the teachings of the apostles because they were too sacred.
Justin Martyr, whom we mentioned before, accused Jewish leaders of deliberately removing
passages from the <i>Old Testament</i>. During the second century, many bishops and writers in the
church accused &#8220;heretics&#8221; of changing the scriptures. Tertullian of Carthage claimed that
Marcion, a leader in what is now Turkey, deliberately cut out pieces of the scriptures that he did
not like, and Clement of Alexandria accused some people of rewriting parts of the gospels. By
the third century, the accusations of changes in the scriptures die down. However, we have
virtually no texts predating the third century by which to verify this. Less than one percent of the
existing <i>New Testament</i> fragments can be dated to the second century, and those are mere
fragments. We also have other writings, letters primarily, from the second century which quote
scriptures and these quotations frequently differ from what we have in the <i>New Testament 
		</i>today.</font></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">In 1 Nephi 13:4-9, Nephi lists several identifying features of the church of the devil. He
says they will torture and slay the saints. They will bind down the people with yokes of iron,
which recalls Joseph Smiths comparison of creeds to iron yokes (Doctrine and Covenants 123:7-8 ). Nephi further tells us that this church was founded by the devil, followed materialistic
pursuits, and sought worldly praise. He further tells us that there are only two churches, the
church of God, and the church of the Devil, which is the great and abominable church. It seems,
then, that Nephi did not have a single ecclesiastical organization in mind, but rather he was
describing all organizations (for that is the original meaning of the word church, or 
		<i>ekklesia</i>, in
Greek) that sought worldly rewards and opposed the Saints of God. In summing up the
constituents of this evil church, Nephi later says, </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<font color="#000080"><i>For the time speedily shall come that all churches which are built up to get gain,
and all those who are built up to get power over the flesh, and those who are built
up to become popular in the eyes of the world, and those who seek the lusts of the
flesh and the things of the world, and to do all manner of iniquity; yea, in fine, all
those who belong to the kingdom of the devil are they who need fear, and tremble,
and quake; they are those who must be brought low in the dust; they are those
who must be consumed as stubble; and this is according to the words of the
prophet </i>(1 Nephi 22:23).</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Furthermore, as Nephi tells us later, many people throughout the ages preceding the
Restoration and the Second Coming would be true, humble followers of Christ who erred only
because of their leaders (2 Nephi 28:14). We know further that the Spirit continued to strive with
men and that some men were inspired. Nephi said of Columbus that he was inspired by God.
Joseph Smith, when he read Foxe&#8217;s Book of the Martyrs which records all those who have died
for the faith from the early Apostles to the Protestant movements, said that many of these people
were true disciples who would receive salvation. President John Taylor said in 1873,
		<i>&#8220;There
were men in those dark ages who could commune with God, and who, by the power of faith,
could draw aside the curtain of eternity and gaze upon the invisible world&#8230; have the ministering
of angels, and unfold the future destinies of the world&#8221; </i>(JD 16:197). As the Prophet Joseph
Smith revealed in these latter days, all those who died without knowing the gospel, who would
have embraced it and lived it had they had the chance, will be heirs of the celestial kingdom. We
must, therefore, be careful when we judge what the final state of others will be.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The confusion and competition that Joseph Smith and his contemporaries observed in the
Christian world continues to this day. A few years ago, spokesmen from a broad range of
Christian churches met to lament this scandal of a divided Christian world and to assess the
continuing barriers to unity. They recognized that the half-century of ecumenical efforts inspired
by the organization of the World Council of Churches in 1948 and earlier reunification
movements had failed, deteriorating into little more than local interfaith discussion groups and
joint humanitarian efforts, most of which had been coopted by the liberal wings of their
churches. The mergers that have occurred in recent decades have been motivated more by
declining membership and financial weakness than from reconciliations of differences in
doctrines or practices. And we appear today to be on the brink of a new rash of divisions as
mainline Protestant churches fail to resolve internal differences about the ordination of women
or the status of homosexuals.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">What is striking in this discussion, for a Latter-day Saint looking on, is the widespread
agreement among conservative Christians of all stripes on the following two propositions: 1)
there has long been a widespread apostasy from the true Christianity, and 2) the True Church
cannot be divided up; its doctrines are not disposable; and compromise between warring factions
cannot lead to truth. Where they all disagree with each other is over the specific forms of
apostasy, and over which churches are apostate, and which are not. The prospects of a united
Christian world are so faint that one symposium participant mused, we will not likely make any
progress until God sends us a solution from heaven. And then he noted ironically, if such divine
aid were to come, it might be in just as unlikely a form as a babe being born in a manger
(<i>Touchstone</i>, August 2003, 51).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Studying the apostasy can help us to understand and appreciate the Restoration even
more. But there is also a lesson here that can benefit each one of us. As individuals, we must
carefully keep our covenants, or we will lose the guidance of the Spirit, and fall into apostasy
ourselves. Further, we must teach this lesson to our children. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has
said, the Church is never more than one generation away from extinction. In each new
generation&#8212;each individual member, needs to be converted, to make a covenant of obedience to
the Father, and to grow in faithfulness in his service.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I bear my testimony that the true church of Jesus Christ has been restored through the
prophet Joseph Smith. Both the Father and the Son, and then numerous angels came to him. The
priesthood of God has been restored. Lost scriptures have been translated and published. We are
the most blessed of all peoples to live in a day when we can be led by a prophet, when the
Church of Christ is solidly established throughout so much of the earth, when we have so many
scriptures and revelations, and when we have temples where the culminating ordinances of the
plan of salvation can be administered. And I leave you that testimony in the name of Jesus
Christ, amen.</font></p>

and blessed his first child, a beautiful little girl.  As we were about to begin the ordinance, I
placed my hand on my son&#8217;s shoulder and I could sense and feel the powerful emotions he was
experiencing.  His voice choked with emotion as he began to speak.  I looked at our son Mike; I
looked at little Emily; and I tried to both savor and capture in my memory this cherished
moment.  As my heart swelled with gratitude and joy and as I was enveloped by an
overpowering feeling of peace, the scriptural theme of our Education Week came into my mind:<i>
&#8220;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.  Let
not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid&#8221; </i>(John 14:27).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I am acquainted with a woman whose elderly mother was involved in a serious
automobile accident.  This loving mother suffered head injuries and severe trauma.  Over the
course of several days in the hospital, pneumonia set in and this noble matriarch slipped into a
semi-comatose state.  And at one point, the doctors advised the family that she would probably
not live through the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The daughter stayed at the hospital with her mother that dark and fateful night&#8212;joined
by an older brother who was less active in the Church.  This sister and brother had an
opportunity during those sleepless hours to visit about and discuss many things.  At one point,
the brother said to his sister: &#8220;I hope there is a God, and I hope all that Mom believes about Him
is true.  She has lived her entire life to that end.&#8221;  The daughter recalls standing in that hospital
room and having a calm, peaceful reassurance encircle her&#8212;a witness that, indeed, all that her
mother believed about her God was true.  That life goes on beyond mortality; that families can
be together forever; that her mother&#8217;s God knew of her situation and would not forsake her.  
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>How grateful the daughter was for what she felt and experienced that night in the
hospital.  Her mother did not pass away that night.  Rather, she was permitted to live and bless
that family with her association for another eight months.  However, those were not easy months
for this caring daughter and her devoted siblings.  The mother the family had known before the
accident never really came back to them, and the family was presented with difficult challenges
and decisions.  Repeatedly, the faithful daughter found herself drawing upon the experience in
the hospital as a source of strength and comfort.  Truly, this good woman came to understand
what the Savior meant when He said,<i> &#8220;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you . . . . 
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I have a friend who recalls a fateful day in early June when she was 12 years old.  Her
father had passed away earlier that morning after having suffered for a relatively short period of
time with cancer.  The mortician had taken away his body, and friends and family were
beginning to call and stop by the house.  She remembers thinking there was too much
commotion and feeling confused, loose-ended, and very much afraid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>At some point, probably about mid-day, this little girl found herself sitting in the room
where her father had died, his hospital bed now empty.  She was sitting on the edge of the other
bed in the room looking out the window across the front yard.  The day was dreary.  It had been
raining for days&#8212;or so it seemed.  Suddenly a ray of sunlight managed to cut through the clouds
and glistened on the wet grass.  At the same time, a ray of hope managed to find its way into the
heart of a 12-year-old girl.  She was filled with an assurance that all was well with her father. 
She knew he was alive!  She knew that all was well with him.  And she knew that all would be
well with her and with her mother and with her brothers and sisters.  This young woman felt the
peace offered by the Savior when He said, <i>&#8220;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you:
not as the world giveth, give I unto you.  Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.&#8221;</i>
The heart of this child was no longer troubled; she was no longer confused or afraid.</span></p>

entire Book of Mormon.  You will recall that Helaman had taken the command over 2,000 young
Lamanites whose parents had sworn never to take up arms against their enemies.  But their sons,
who had not taken the oath, placed themselves under Helaman&#8217;s direction and helped the
Nephites in their critical battles against the Lamanites.  Because of their remarkable faith and
ability, these young men were instrumental in helping to defend the rights of the Nephite people.</span></p>

preparations of these young men for war&#8212;and about the specific type of spiritual help they
received.  In verse 10 we read:</span></p>

the blessings of assurance and peace to their souls&#8212;which assurance and peace produced
courage and determination and the capacity to go forth into battle with all of their might.  These
faithful and stalwart young men undoubtedly were learning what the Savior meant when He said,
		<i>&#8220;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you . . . .  Let not your heart be troubled, neither
let it be afraid.&#8221;</i></span></p>

activity, a water party.  At one point during the afternoon, the little boy decided to lie down on
the blacktop of the parking lot to dry off.  A neighbor and fellow ward member accidentally ran
over the boy, killing him almost instantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As the little boy&#8217;s mother knelt over his lifeless body, she found the following questions
racing through her mind: &#8220;Oh, son, why would you lie down on the blacktop?  Why did you not
move when you heard the car start?&#8221;  A thought then came into the mind of that sorrowing
mother almost as quickly as the questions had come: &#8220;If he could answer me, he would say:
&#8216;Mom, it does not even matter.  It just does not matter.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In those initial moments after losing her son, this woman was blessed with the peace
promised by the Savior&#8212;the assurance that, in the eternal scheme of things, the questions she
had simply did not matter.  Her son had been transferred into another phase of his eternal
existence, and the process by which that transfer came to pass simply did not matter.  This young
mother was experiencing what the Savior meant when He said, <i>&#8220;Peace I leave with you, my
peace I give unto you . . . .  Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As Sister Bednar mentioned, the theme for our Education Week this year is found in John
chapter 14, verse 27: <i>&#8220;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth,
give I unto you.  Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When I learned several months ago what the theme for Education Week was to be, I
began a process of asking family and friends and acquaintances about peace.  The stories and
scriptures I have just shared with you came from that process of inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As I have thought about our theme and reflected upon these stories and many similar
ones, I have been impressed by three recurring principles related to peace: (1) peace is centered
in Christ, (2) faith and hope in the Savior invite the spiritual gift of peace into our lives&#8212;the
peace that only the Prince of Peace can offer, and (3) the peace Christ gives passeth all
understanding.  I now want to briefly address each of these principles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Principle #1 &#8212; Peace is centered in Christ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-weight: bold">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The world searches to and fro for peace and often believes personal fulfillment is to be
found in satisfying relationships, or in the advice so readily dispensed in the self-help section of
a local bookstore, or in temporal possessions and security.  Such approaches to finding peace
wholly and totally miss the mark&#8212;which is the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The Book of Mormon teaches about two basic kinds of peace: civil and spiritual.  Civil
peace, which is the absence of physical and social conflict, was much desired and sought after by
the righteous peoples described in the Book of Mormon.  Of even greater value, however, is the
spiritual peace or &#8220;peace of conscience&#8221; that is granted to faithful individuals by the Holy Ghost
through application of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Peace originates in Christ and
comes from and because of Christ.  And it is imperative that we remember, brothers and sisters, 
it is <span style="font-weight: bold">His</span> peace which 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">He</span> gives unto us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Please turn with me to Mosiah 4:1-3.  In these verses we learn about the reaction of
King&#160;Benjamin&#8217;s people to his supernal sermon about the Savior and His atonement.  We also
learn that true peace of conscience is centered in the Redeemer and flows from His infinite
Atonement.</span></p>

blood of Christ that makes both of these sweet spiritual outcomes possible.</span></p>

Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ&#8212;that is total trust in Him, complete confidence in Him, and a
ready reliance on His merits, mercy, and grace&#8212;leads to hope, a hope through the Atonement in
the power of the resurrection and in eternal life that invites the sweet peace of conscience for
which men and women have always yearned.  The redeeming and cleansing power of the
Savior&#8217;s Atonement helps us to dispel the despair caused by transgression and sin.  And the
enabling and strengthening aspect of the Atonement helps us to see and to do and to become
good in ways that we could never recognize or accomplish with our limited mortal capacity.  As
we work and learn and progress and struggle, we are blessed to know that <i>&#8220;. . . he who doeth the
works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the
world to come&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants&#160;59:23).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Principle #3 &#8212; The peace Christ gives passeth all understanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As I was preparing this message and discussing the topic of peace with family and
friends, I was struck by how many times important and even dramatic life events were
mentioned&#8212;events such as the death of a loved one, the birth of a child, the struggle with
physical pain and limitation, or the pivotal nature of a family or career decision.  It was
particularly interesting that the experience of losing a loved one to death was mentioned most
frequently.  Now, we all recognize and know that receiving the spiritual gift of peace is not
solely associated with life-changing and emotional events; we frequently are blessed with peace
of conscience in small and simple and seemingly insignificant ways.  Nevertheless,  I wondered
why my questions about peace elicited such consistent responses related to the most difficult and
demanding episodes of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>But the reasons are quite obvious.  Peace is centered in the Lord Jesus Christ.  Faith and
hope in the Savior invite the spiritual gift of peace into our lives.  Our understanding of the plan
of happiness and of the role of the infinite and eternal Atonement enables us to see somewhat
beyond the boundaries and limitations of mortality.  And when we are then confronted with the
greatest challenges of our mortal existence, a loving Savior grants unto us a peace that extends
beyond mortality and into eternity.  It is a peace of conscience that cannot be comprehended in
earthly or rational terms.  As Paul explained to the Philippians:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts

glimpse of the family unit in eternity.  The daughter who cared for her ailing mother was
strengthened by the knowledge that her mother would be resurrected and have a perfected and
glorified body and live eternally.  The 12-year-old girl who lost her father received help from
heaven to know that, truly, families can and will be together forever as we are true and faithful to
our ordinances and covenants.  The Sons of Helaman were strengthened to fight with a firmness
and a conviction born of faith in Christ and in the eternal correctness of their cause.  And the
mother who lost her six-year-old son knew in her heart&#8212;in a way that could not necessarily be
fully understood in her mind&#8212;that <i>&#8220;. . . those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall
be sweet unto them&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 42:46).  When words cannot provide the solace
we need or seek, when it is simply futile to attempt to explain that which is unexplainable, when
logic and reason cannot yield adequate understanding of the injustices and inequities of life,
when mortal experience and analysis are insufficient, and when it seems that perhaps we are so
totally alone, then comes the peace that only the Prince of Peace can give&#8212;truly, a peace that
passeth all understanding.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>Once, as a young man full of exuberant fancy, I undertook to draw up a catalogue
of the acknowledged &#8220;goods&#8221; of life.  As other men sometimes tabulate lists of
properties they own or would like to own, I set down my inventory of earthly
desirables: health, love, beauty, talent, power, riches, and fame&#8212;together with
several minor ingredients of what I considered man&#8217;s perfect portion.</i></span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>When my inventory was completed I proudly showed it to a wise elder who had
been the mentor and spiritual model of my youth.  Perhaps I was trying to impress
him with my precocious wisdom and the large universality of my interests. 
Anyway, I handed him the list.  &#8220;This,&#8221; I told him confidently, &#8220;is the sum of
mortal goods.  Could a man possess them all, he would be as a god.&#8221;</i></span></p>

patient net.  &#8220;An excellent list,&#8221; he said, pondering it thoughtfully.  &#8220;Well
digested in content and set down in not-unreasonable order.  But it appears, my
young friend, that you have omitted the most important element of all.  You have
forgotten the one ingredient lacking which each possession becomes a hideous
torment, and your list as a whole an intolerable burden.&#8221;</i></span></p>

of mind&#8212;that is His final guerdon of approval, the fondest sign of His love.  He
bestows it charily.  Most men are never blessed with it; others wait all their

But a quarter of a century of personal experience and professional observation
has served only to confirm his almost oracular utterance.  I have come to
understand that peace of mind is the characteristic mark of God Himself . . . .  I
know now that the sum of all other possessions does not necessarily add up to
peace of mind: yet, on the other hand, I have seen this inner tranquility flourish
without the material supports of property or even the buttress of physical health. 
Slowly, painfully, I have learned that peace of mind may transform a cottage into
a spacious manor hall; the want of it can make a regal park an imprisoning

Redeemer and the Savior of all mankind.  I testify that peace is centered in Christ.  In a world
that grows ever more tumultuous and troubled and unsettled, we can be blessed with peace of
conscience and a clear sense of purpose and direction.  I bear witness that the spiritual gifts of
faith and hope in the Savior invite the companion gift of peace into our lives.  And I further
testify that the peace Christ gives to us is sweet and reassuring and passeth all understanding.

<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Education Week Devotional</p>
<p style="text-align: center">June 24, 2004</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Sister Susan Bednar</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When I was a little girl, I always pictured myself as the mother of pretty little girls
dressed in pink, lacy dresses who played quietly in the playroom with their Barbie dolls.  Well,
as many of you know, that didn&#8217;t turn our to be the case.  My husband and I were blessed with
three highly spirited, rambunctious sons who spent their childhood listening to me tell them, &#8220;If
you want to roughhouse like that, you&#8217;ll have to go outside.&#8221;  I was amused one day when I
learned by reading in the interior design section of a magazine that the color blue engendered
feelings of peace and tranquility.  I knew then why I had always loved the color blue and had felt
an almost obsessive need to have a touch of that peace-generating color in our home. 
Subconsciously, I think I must have desired a hint of peace to counteract the spunk of these
active young boys.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When I was informed that our theme for this year&#8217;s Education Week was centered on
peace, I had to chuckle as several memories of times when I was not at peace flashed through my
mind.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I remembered the anxiety I felt when our son Mike wrote home from the mission field to
tell us that he had been bitten by a dog.  Of course, the bite just barely broke the skin and the dog
had vaccination papers-or so Mike reported.  Considering where he was serving in Bolivia, I
found that hard to believe.  I knew Mike all too well.  He just didn&#8217;t want to tell his mission
president and go through the agony of having rabies shots for what he considered a simple dog
bite.  We didn&#8217;t receive this letter until six weeks after the incident, so there wasn&#8217;t much I could
do but worry.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I thought of the day we flew home from Finland with our son Eric at the completion of
his mission.  Our plane was making it&#8217;s final approach at the Dallas airport when the pilot
suddenly aborted our landing just seconds before the wheels touched down, and we shot back up
into the air.  A few minutes later, the crew reported that an indicator light had flashed just as we
were ready to land, and they needed time in the air to run some tests, confer with mechanics on
the ground, and figure out if there was a potential problem.  I didn&#8217;t exactly feel a sense of
reassurance at that time either.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I remembered the exasperation and desperation I felt the afternoon I was preparing a
meal for President Thomas S. Monson who was coming to our home here in Rexburg for dinner
that night.  Right in the middle of cooking food for that meal, our local power went off for two
hours.  Now that distressful situation certainly didn&#8217;t lend itself to a feeling of peace.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I could go on and on, but I think you get the picture.  Judging by the looks I see on your
faces, you too have experienced these kind of not-so-peaceful moments.  But they are just that-moments in life when we need the Savior&#8217;s help to replace feelings of worry, fear, or distress
with feelings of peace, confidence, and comfort.  Whether the trials we experience are brief or
extended we can count on heavenly help to assist us, for our Savior said:<i> &#8220;Peace I leave with
you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.  Let not your heart be
troubled, neither let it be afraid&#8221; </i>(John 14:27).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Let me share two examples of this sacred peace at work in the lives of people who are
dear to me.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Almost two years ago, I was listening to an early-morning newscast while walking on my
treadmill when suddenly my attention focused on breaking news about a sniper in the
Washington, D.C., area.  You may remember how over the course of days, fear struck this part of
the country as a methodical pattern of attack and a defined area of siege began to emerge. 
Innocent men, women, and children standing outside shopping centers, gas stations, restaurants,
bus stops, and schools were stalked in the sights of a high-powered rifle and then fatally shot by
an unknown expert marksman.  I watched with interest every day as press conferences
originating from Rockville, Maryland, disclosed unfolding details in the case.  I was intensely
interested because my sister&#8217;s mailing address is Rockville, Maryland, and she and her family
lived within miles of where some of these senseless acts of violence were occurring.  We talked
on the phone during that time, and our family prayed for her family.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I visited recently with my sister about that terrifying chain of events and found her
recollection of those unsettling days fascinating.  When I asked what thoughts came to her mind
about that time, she said, &#8220;Those three weeks seemed like an eternity to me.  To say I wasn&#8217;t a
bit nervous wouldn&#8217;t be true.  But though I felt concerned, I never felt panicked.  We couldn&#8217;t
stop living our lives.  I found myself paying closer attention to my surroundings, especially when
I parked my van in a parking lot.  I remember not wanting to stop at a gas station to fill up my
van.&#8221;</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I asked what she and her husband had done to prepare their children.  She commented
that they asked for protection for each family member in their family prayers every morning
before their children left for school.  They reminded their children that if they were in the right
places, doing the right things, and listening to the promptings of the Holy Ghost, they would be
warned of danger and helped and guided.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>What I thought was most remarkable were her thoughts about the peace she felt during
that troubled time.  She said even though her children experienced lock-downs at school and one
of the shootings took place just a mile from her daughter&#8217;s school, she had an assurance in her
heart that her children were okay.  She experienced feelings of peace and calm and never
worried about their safety.  &#8220;I knew our children would be protected,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When I asked what she had gained from the experience, she answered that this trying
time had been an occasion for her family to demonstrate belief.  &#8220;We had an opportunity to put
gospel principles to the test,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;We had to trust that the Lord would protect us and guide
us.&#8221;</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>She ended with this thought: &#8220;I felt peace in our home because it had been dedicated as a
place of safety; and every time I drove by the Washington D.C. Temple and saw its spires
emerge in the sky, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and comfort.  We live in an area where
there is always going to be the turmoil of terror, but I have places to go where I can feel peace,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When others were frantic and fearful, where did this sense of peace come from?  It came
from the Savior who said,<i> &#8220;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world
giveth, give I unto you.  Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Several years ago, long-time Church friends and neighbors of ours were so excited to go
on what they considered to be the trip of a lifetime.  This couple carefully planned a professional
trip to mainland China that combined business with pleasure.  But while they were there, the
husband took sick with what they thought was the flu.  By the time they sought medical
attention, it was apparent that his condition was critical and he died suddenly and unexpectedly a
short time later.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When we received word of the husband&#8217;s passing, I couldn&#8217;t help but think, &#8220;What will
my friend do?  She&#8217;s in China, all alone, with no members of the Church to help her and no
priesthood brethren to give her a blessing.&#8221;  I felt prompted to pray and ask our Father in Heaven
to send angels to attend and comfort her as she dealt with the sorrow in her heart and faced the
difficult logistical process of arranging to bring her husband&#8217;s body back to the United States for
burial.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As we visited face-to-face on the afternoon of her husband&#8217;s funeral, I told this special
friend of my prayer for her.  She said something I will never forget, &#8220;Susan, I never felt alone.&#8221; 
She had drawn strength from the power of her covenants and had felt a sense of peace that only
the Savior could give.  Sweet is the peace the gospel brings.  <i>&#8220;Peace I leave with you, my peace I
give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.  Let not your heart be troubled, neither
let it be afraid.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Brothers and sisters, peace is knowing that the doctrines and principles of the restored
gospel of Jesus Christ are true.  Peace is knowing that God lives and loves us and that Jesus
Christ is our Savior and Redeemer.  Peace is knowing that God continues to speak His mind and
will through anointed prophets and apostles.  And finally, peace is knowing that we are striving
to live our lives in accordance with God&#8217;s will.  There truly is &#8220;peace in righteous doing.&#8221;  May
we qualify for the blessing of peace in our lives is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold"><i>&#8220;Preparation Brings Peace&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University- Idaho</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Education Week Devotional</p>
<p style="text-align: center">June 25, 2004</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Elder W. Rolfe Kerr</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As the time of the Savior&#8217;s betrayal and crucifixion was drawing near, Jesus made
every effort to comfort and assure His chosen few.  He assured them that He would not leave
them comfortless-He would come to them (John 14:18). He also assured them that the Father
would send the Comforter, even the Holy Ghost, who would teach them all things, and bring
all things to their remembrance (John 14:26). He then gave them His ultimate reassurance in
words recorded in John 14:27 which have served as the theme for this Education Week. The
Savior said: <i>&#8220;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give
I unto you&#8221;</i>. There is a marvelous and reassuring sense of comfort which comes with this
divine expression and promise of His peace as only He can give it. His promise of peace
comes with the assurance that it would not be in the form of some worldly charade which so
often offers a false sense of peace and well-being. This is all very reassuring. There is,
however, another sentence in the verse of scripture from which your theme is drawn that is
not included in your theme. It is this sentence on which I would like to focus. It defines the
effect and the results that the Savior intended for His peace to have upon us. It reads: 
		<i>&#8220;Let
not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid&#8221;</i> (John 14:27).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>For what greater comfort could we ask than His peace in our lives? What more do we
need than His assurance that our hearts have no reason to be troubled or to be afraid? I have
known personally the fear that comes from a medically troubled heart. I have counseled those
with morally troubled hearts and consoled those with heavy and broken hearts. There are
those with frightened hearts, dealing with anxieties over issues often beyond their control.
The Savior&#8217;s reassurances of His peace were of a nature which can bring comfort to any
troubled and fearful heart. His peace is that inner peace, comfort, and joy which accompany
the well-ordered life, but it is also that inner peace, comfort, and joy that come to all of us as
we come to believe in Him and believe Him. His peace would most assuredly allay the fears
of spiritually troubled hearts. The spiritually troubled are typically the unfaithful, the
unworthy, and the unrepentant. The troubled and fearful heart is usually found in the
disobedient, the disrespectful, and the disbelieving. Peace comes to these as they bring the
Savior into their lives-as they accept the beneficial blessings of His great atoning sacrifice.
His peace comes to those who prepare themselves with repentance, resolution, righteousness.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Using the descriptive metaphor of the armor used in battles of ancient eras, the
Apostle Paul gave us an enlightening sense of how we might ensure the inner peace of our
own lives. He wrote to the Ephesians challenging them to put on the whole armour of God,
with the hope and purpose that they would be able to stand against the wiles of the devil, that
they would be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. He wrote:
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the
breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the
gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be
able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of
salvation, and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God: Praying
always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit... </i>(Ephesians 6:14-17).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Every principle behind each piece of armor Paul describes is important to our sense of
inner peace. Truth, righteousness, the gospel of peace, faith, the word of God, and prayer all
combine to provide a marvelous sense of spiritual security and strength. The foundation for
this security and strength comes with Paul&#8217;s inferred suggestion that our feet must be firmly
planted and immovable. He said, <i>&#8220;Stand therefore, having...your feet shod with the
preparation of the gospel of peace;&#8221;</i> I believe that this should suggest to all of us that our
understanding, our testimony, and our valiance in the gospel of Jesus Christ prepares us to
receive His peace. Surely: <i>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Preparation Brings Peace</span>.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#160;The Lord declared in this dispensation, 
		<i>&#8220;... but if ye are prepared ye shall not fear&#8221;
</i>(Doctrine and Covenants 38:30). In the stake conferences of the Church in year 2003, we
talked and thought much of self reliance. All of this has been with the view in mind of
temporal and spiritual preparation. It has been with a view of eliminating unnecessary fear
from our lives through preparation. You have come here to participate in this Education
Week to prepare yourselves both temporally and spiritually to cope in an increasingly
difficult and challenging world. When this week is over, you will have acquired knowledge
that is both enlightening and inspiring. You will have received impressions of both mind and
spirit that will strengthen you in the years ahead. You will have taken unto yourselves some
of God&#8217;s armor that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to
stand. To stand, in President Hinckley&#8217;s words, for something. To stand for the truth. To
stand for righteousness. To stand firmly and forever with your preparation of the gospel of
peace. Preparation-both temporal and spiritual-does bring peace. It brings peace to the
troubled and fearful heart.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Elder Marvin J. Ashton described peace as the opposite of fear. He said, 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Peace is a blessing that comes to those who trust in God. It is established
through individual righteousness. True personal peace comes about through
eternal vigilance and constant righteous efforts. No man can be at peace who
is untrue to his better self. No man can have lasting peace who is living a lie.
Peace can never come to the (unrepentant) transgressor of the law.
Commitment to God&#8217;s laws is the basis for peace. Peace is something we earn.
It is not a gift. Rather, it is a possession earned by those who love God and
work to achieve the blessings of peace. It is not a written document. It is
something that must come from within. Never will peace and hatred be able to
abide in the same soul. Feelings of enmity and malice can never be compatible
with feelings of peace. Wickedness, no matter how it is labeled or
camouflaged, will eventually bring grief and heartache and wipe out inner
peace. A testimony of the truthfulness of the teachings of our Savior gives
personal peace in times of adversity. Peace is not a purchase away. Peace is
not when the final installment is paid. Peace is not when marriage comes (nor
even when an unhappy marriage ends) nor when all the children are enrolled
in school. True peace must not be dependent upon conditions or happenings.
Peace must stem from an inward contentment built upon trust, faith, and good
will toward God, fellowmen, and self. Inner peace is the prized possession of
God&#8217;s valiant</i> (Ensign, Nov. 1985, 69).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">The search for peace is one of the ultimate quests of the human soul. We all
have highs and lows, but such times come and they usually always go. Kind
neighbors assist. Beautiful sunshine brings encouragement. A good night&#8217;s
sleep usually works wonders. But there are times in all our lives when deep
sorrow or suffering or fear or loneliness makes us cry out for the peace which
only God Himself can bring. Christ and His angels and His prophets forever
labor to buoy up our spirits, steady our nerves, calm our hearts, send us forth
with renewed strength and resolute hope. In that spirit we declare to all the
world that for real and abiding peace to come, we must strive to be more like
that exemplary Son of God&#8221; (Ensign, Nov. 1996, 82).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The peace the Savior brings to our lives is not just that peace that comes from His
atoning sacrifice. It is also the peace we enjoy as we come to know, accept, and live His
gospel-even the &#8220;gospel of peace.&#8221; The peaceful paths we walk in life can be warm,
welcome, and without fear, so long as we prepare ourselves for our journey by embracing the
gospel with all our hearts.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Ponder with me some lines from one of our hymns which speaks to the sweetness of
the peace the gospel brings. (Sweet is the Peace the Gospel Brings, #14)</p>

<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Alma, the great Book of Mormon prophet, taught the people of Gideon the certainty
of the anticipated birth and sacred mission of Christ and challenged them to embrace the
gospel. He perceived that they were in the paths of righteousness-in the path which leads to
the kingdom of God. He admonished them to be humble, submissive and gentle; easy to be
entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in
keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things they stood in
need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things
they did receive (Alma 7:19-23). That same admonition applies equally to us in this day and
age. He expressed the joy he felt because of the &#8220;exceeding diligence and heed&#8221; which these
people had given to those truths which he had taught and to which he had so fervently
testified. Then, because of their goodness, he pronounced a marvelous and reassuring
blessing upon them. He Said,<i>&#8220;And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your
houses and lands, and upon your flocks and herds, and all that you possess, your women and
your children, according to your faith and good works, from this time forth and forever&#8221;</i>
(Alma 7:27; see verses 16-26).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Alma pronounced these profound blessings of peace-the peace of God-upon them and
by inference upon us. His profound expression specified the condition and promise
associated with the blessings. The condition-<i>According to our faith and good works</i>. The
promise-<i>From this time forth and forever.</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>May we now place ourselves in their position and ask if we are prepared to comply
with those conditions of &#8220;faith and good works&#8221; required of us to receive the same promised
peace of God in our lives &#8220;from this time forth and forever&#8221;. Thinking of Alma&#8217;s blessing,
		<i>&#8220;May the peace of God rest upon you.&#8221;</i> This may be viewed as both a declaration and a
question. Let us look at it for a moment as a question. <i>&#8220;May the peace of God rest upon
you?&#8221;</i> Are you spiritually prepared and worthy of the blessings of His peace to be upon you?
Upon you personally? Upon your houses and lands? That is, upon your homes and properties.
Upon your flocks and herds? For those not involved in farming and ranching, this can apply
to your professions, occupations, daily work and responsibility. Upon all that you possess?
Upon your women and children? That is, upon your marriages and families?</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As we consider Alma&#8217;s marvelous blessing of the &#8220;peace of God&#8221; resting upon us in
our lives, let us reflect again upon the Savior&#8217;s gift of peace: <i>&#8220;Peace I leave with you, my
peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you</i>.<i> Let not your heart be
troubled, neither let it be afraid.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In our recent April General Conference, President Hinckley and others of the
Brethren spoke of the perilous times in which we live. We only have to listen to the nightly
news or read the newspapers to sense the severity and the peril of our times. Surely, there is
ample justification in our being a little frightened by it all. No one would question our
strength and resolve if they were to learn that our hearts were even a little troubled by the
tragedies and violence we see occurring about us every day. Wars, abductions, drought,
disease, and a wide range of personal challenge and tragedy seem to dominate the news and
all too often impact our own lives. Some of you have loved-ones serving in Iraq or
Afghanistan, or other troubled places in the world. We all long for some semblance of peace
to come to the world, to our neighborhoods, and even in some cases to our own families and
our own lives. President Hinckley has assured us that peril is not a new condition for the
human family, and he gave ample reason to be comforted and confident in the future. He
said, <i>&#8220;Notwithstanding the great evil of these times, what a glorious season it has been and
now is. A new day has come in the work of the Almighty. That work has grown and
strengthened and moved across the earth. It has now touched for good the lives of millions,
and this is only the beginning.&#8221;</i> President Hinckley asked, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Do we really comprehend, do we understand the tremendous significance of
that which we have? This is the summation of the generations of man, the
concluding chapter in the entire panorama of the human experience. We must
do all that is required in moving forward the work of the Lord in building His
kingdom in the earth. We of this generation are the end harvest of all that has
gone before. It is not enough to simply be known as a member of this Church.
A solemn obligation rests upon us. Let us face it and work at it. We must live
as true followers of the Christ, with charity toward all, returning good for
evil, teaching by example the ways of the Lord, and accomplishing the vast
service he has outlined for us. May we live worthy of the glorious endowment
of light and understanding and eternal truth which has come to us through all
the perils of the past. Somehow, among all who have walked the earth, we
have been brought forth in this unique and remarkable season. Be grateful,
and above all be faithful</i> (Ensign, May 2004, 81).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>A knowledge of who we are and what we are and who and what we must become can
be unsettling, but it can also be a great source of peace in our lives. Our thoughts of the
Saviors&#8217; peace naturally leads us to reflect on the prophecies of His Second Coming. Elder
Dallin H. Oaks addressed the importance of our preparation for His Millennial return. He
said, <i>&#8220;While we are powerless to alter the fact of the Second Coming and unable to know its
exact time, we can accelerate our own preparation and try to influence the preparation of
those around us&#8221;</i> (Ensign, May 2004, 7).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>This was a stirring address by Elder Oaks-one that should cause each of us to consider
far more seriously the state of our preparation. Think with me of another prophet-leader who
many generations ago made similar appeals to his people to prepare for the coming of Christ.
In this case it was to prepare for His &#8220;First Coming,&#8221; rather than His &#8220;Second.&#8221; We have
recorded in the pages of the Book of Mormon the marvelous address of King Benjamin
delivered approximately 124 years before the birth of Christ. He taught in very specific terms
of the birth, life, and mission of the Savior. He taught the &#8220;gospel of peace&#8221; to his people and
challenged them to live it. He beautifully projected the thoughts of his people toward the
meaning and significance of the atoning sacrifice Jesus would offer for all mankind, and he
challenged them to live and believe and rejoice<i> &#8220;even as though he had already come among
them&#8221;</i> (Mosiah 3:13). Picture the scene - King Benjamin standing on the tower that had been
erected for him that his people might hear the words which he would speak to them. He
begins by telling them of the importance of what he has to say to them. He gains their
attention by saying,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I have not commanded you to come up hither to trifle with the words which I
shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye
may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the
mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view&#8221;</i> (Mosiah 2:9).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Now, I invite all within the sound of my voice to open your ears that you may hear,
and open your hearts that you may understand, and open your minds that the mysteries of
God may be unfolded to your view. Hear, feel, and sense the significance of King Benjamin&#8217;s
words as he projected the vision of his people forward to the coming of Christ. As you do
this&#8212;hear, feel, and sense his words as if he were speaking to us today.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men,
to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby
whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive
remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy even as though
he had already come among them</i> (Mosiah 3:13).</p>
<p>Even as though He had already come among them!</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I would ask you these Key Questions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">1. Is it possible for us to look to the Savior&#8217;s Second Coming even as King
Benjamin urged his people to look to the birth of Jesus Christ?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">2. Can the promise of remission of sins and &#8220;rejoicing with exceedingly great
joy&#8221; be transferred to our day, even as though He had already come among us?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">3. Can we live with faith and good works sufficient to have the peace of God
rest with us from this time forth and forever&#8212;even as though He had already
come among us?</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The Second Coming of Our Lord is certain. This glorious event will most certainly
announce the commencement of the Millennium. The timing is uncertain, but the signs of His
coming are unfolding around us daily as so many prophecies are being fulfilled. There should
be no panic, because there are many scriptural events which must yet occur, but neither
should we be complacent in our preparations. Can we feel and demonstrate a sense of
urgency, without it manifesting itself as panic? I believe we can. The conditions that will
exist after His Second Coming have been scripturally and prophetically described.<i>
</i>Most
notably, He will reign under conditions of righteousness and peace. The Lord said: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For the hour is nigh, and that which was spoken by mine apostles must be
fulfilled; for as they spoke so shall it come to pass; For I will reveal myself
from heaven with power and great glory, with all the hosts thereof, and dwell
in righteousness with men on earth a thousand years, and the wicked shall not
stand </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 29:10-11).</p>
<p>Isaiah described the Millennial condition, saying,<i> &#8220;And the work of righteousness shall be
peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever. And my people shall
dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places&#8221;</i> (Isaiah
32:17-18).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Do you see the linkage between righteousness and peace? As the Savior taught the
Nephites, He described the last days and further provides that linkage for us. Quoting Isaiah
He said, <i>&#8220;And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy
children. In righteousness shalt thou be established; thou shalt be far from oppression for
thou shalt not fear, and from terror for it shall not come near thee&#8221;</i> (3 Nephi 22:13-14).
Being far from oppression, fear, and terror is a very timely promise of peace in today&#8217;s world.
But, note the condition-established in righteousness!</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>If we are to enjoy the peace that Jesus promised, freeing us of our troubled and fearful
hearts, and if the &#8220;peace of God&#8221; is to rest with us in our personal lives, in our work, with all
that we possess, and with our families; then it will be upon the conditions of righteousness.
Peace of mind, peace of conscience, peace of soul, the peace that Jesus gives is a gift that is
bestowed upon us&#8212;a gift that is made available to us. But it must be earned and received by
our faithfulness. The Savior said, <i>&#8220;For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon
him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him,
neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:33).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Could I suggest again that receiving the gift of peace in our lives requires individual
preparation. &#8220;Peace can only come as we prepare ourselves with righteousness.&#8221; Remember -
&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Preparation Brings Peace</span>!&#8221; There is that temporal preparation that comes with learning,
living within our means, paying off our debts, saving, and storing. Spiritually speaking, that
everlasting peace Jesus promises is an inner peace, established in prayer, born of faith,
anchored by testimony, shown by forgiveness of others&#8217; trespasses against us, expressed
through love, and earned through repentance and righteous living.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I pray that every one of us here assembled and any others who may have reason to
consider these thoughts will begin today to more actively and aggressively prepare to be
worthy of the peace Jesus gives, to merit having the peace of God to rest with us, and to do so
by living as we would &#8220;even as though He had already come among us. May we know of the
truth of the Savior words when He said, &#8220;<i>But learn that he who doeth the works of
righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world and eternal life in the world
to come</i>&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenants 59:23). If we have prepared ourselves to truly know and
experience inner peace, there is no need for fear during the storms of our lives or in the
perilous times of the world.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Elder Bruce R. McConkie captured the full meaning of what I have been trying to say
when he wrote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Be it known that it is the privilege of the saints today to separate themselves
from the world and to receive millennial blessings in their lives. And any
person who today abides the laws that will be kept during the Millennium will
receive, here and now, the spirit and blessings of the Millennium in his life
(Millennial Messiah, 682, emphasis added).</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I bear witness-even especial witness-of the divinity of His mission, of the reality of
His resurrection, of the certainty of His Second Coming, and of the power of His peace. May
we prepare to live in His peace <i>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Even As Though He had already come</span>!&#8221;</i> (Second Coming)</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I remember so well one beautiful sunny morning last month when I was preparing for this
talk. The air was still and cool; the spring growth on the bushes in the back yard was vibrant
green in the dappled sunlight. Blooms on the freshly planted geraniums were round and full; and
there was dew on the climbing roses which were laden with luscious, peachy-pink blossoms. As
I looked out the dining room window I thought of Robert Browning&#8217;s poem, Pippa&#8217;s Song</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>We don&#8217;t say that much any more. In fact, I don&#8217;t think we say &#8220;All&#8217;s right with the
world&#8221; at all. I cherished that peaceful moment more than usual that morning and steeled myself
from the headlines in the newspaper describing bombing attacks, tornadoes, bulldozing of
homes, political barrages. How I wished the world could share the feelings of peace and serenity
I was enjoying at that moment!</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Could that happen? For the world, I&#8217;m not so sure, though leaders labor to sign peace
agreements and establish responsible governments. But could peace come to us, individually? A
resounding YES! Changing situations in the world is generally beyond our control, but that is not
to say that things we do individually and as families can&#8217;t help bring about that peace. We can
invite peace into our lives and we can sustain that peace despite turmoil in the country and terror
in the world. Today I want to address the inner peace that gives us the courage to make a
difference in the lives of those we love, and thus to our extended communities.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Peace comes from within. Think about it. When have you felt peace? It can&#8217;t be
purchased at the mall or cooked up in the kitchen. It is not transferred easily from one to another,
except from the Lord. Jesus Christ promised: <i>&#8220;Peace I leave with you, my peace give I unto you,
not as the world giveth, give I unto you&#8221; </i>(John 14:27). Peace is his to give and ours to receive.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I felt peace that morning as I openly appreciated God&#8217;s creations outside my window.
You don&#8217;t have to go far to find peace. Peace comes from searching and pondering the
scriptures, from fostering unity within a family, from the cleansing power of forgiveness, from
the hard work of daily living, from living righteously, smiling often, finding something &#8211; and
there is always something &#8211; that can point your gaze to the goodness to God.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Elder Richard L. Evans observed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>To find peace-the peace within, the peace that passeth understanding-men must
live in honesty, honoring each other, honoring obligations, working willingly,
loving and cherishing loved ones, serving and considering others, with patience,
with virtue, with faith and forbearance, with the assurance that life is for
learning, for serving, for repenting, and improving.</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I was raised at the edge of one of the three prairie provinces in Canada where the golden
wheat fields stretched as far as the eye could see in one direction, and the Rockies rose
majestically in the other. I love that country and God who made it. The wild flowers are prolific
in the foothills, and identifying them brings me simple and great joy. The horizon is constant;
you can count on the sun bursting over the fields in the morning and dipping behind the
mountains at night.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#160;Oh, Canada, we sing in Alberta. It is the peaceful land of my youth. I have found similar
satisfaction in vistas around the world: overlooking the broad plains in the country of Georgia as
they edge toward the Caucasus Mountains or reflecting on the fairy tales that fit in the castles of
Germany, exiting Sardine Canyon into the rich Cache Valley in Utah, looking across the
pancake-flat plains of Mongolia, the towering Tetons of Idaho you have at your own back door.
Nature speaks peace to me.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>So does human effort. Our souls seek peace and rest. Yet it is in such short supply. We
can find it in the scriptures. I have often related to Nephi when he said: <i>&#8220;For my soul delighteth
in the scriptures and my heart pondereth them and writeth them for the learning and the profit of
my children&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 4:15).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#160;This picture hung on the wall of my office in the Relief Society building for seven years.
Look at the busy hands, the well-worn scriptures, the study materials, and especially at the
beautiful, angelic smile. The background, bleak and colorless, can not compete with the
countenance of this woman-and her feeling of peace and serenity. When I looked at her and I
could hear the words of Alma: <i>&#8220;May the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your houses and
lands, and upon your flocks and herds, and all that you possess . . .according to your faith and
good works, from this time forth and forever&#8221;</i> (Alma 7:27). She has earned peace. Is it so with
us?</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Where do you turn when you are puzzled, discouraged, or nearly defeated? Where do you
find comfort and encouragement on those days when the sun does not seem to shine on you or
your part of the world? Do you stand looking up at the sky-or even shaking a fist at the sky? Or
do you get to your knees and seek divine guidance, encouragement, and solace. Section 6 of the
Doctrine and Covenants reminds us:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in
the kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God; for there is no
gift greater than the gift of salvation.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, blessed art thou for what thou hast done; for thou
hast inquired of me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired thou hast received
instruction of my Spirit. If it had not been so, thou wouldst not have come to the
place where thou art at this time.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind;
and now I tell these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened
by the Spirit of truth</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 6:13-15).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As I served in Relief Society there were often thorny issues to deal with, troubling
decisions to be made. Although I had willing counselors, sometimes I had to act alone and how I
relied on verse 23! <i>&#8220;Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater
witness can you have than from God?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>How I needed the witness of the spirit. How I needed God&#8217;s peace. Verses 36 and 37 gave me
additional comfort: <i>&#8220;Look to me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. Behold the wounds which
pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my
commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In the scriptures we read of wars and turmoil which parallel in many ways the days in
which we now are living. We can find comfort in knowing that righteousness will prevail.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>What did Elder Oaks state at April conference? 
		<i>&#8220;Our team wins.&#8221; </i>This war between
good and evil which began in heaven continues here on earth. We will win this war; but for now,
we are on the battlefield. There will be a time as William Gladstone has stated, 
		<i>&#8220;When the power
of love will replace the love of power. Then will our world know the blessings of peace.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>There is precedent, you know. After the Savior&#8217;s visit to the Nephites,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>It came to pass that there was no contention in the land because of the love of
God which did dwell in the hearts of the people. And there were no envyings, nor
strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings nor murders, nor any manner of
lasciviousness, and surely there could not be a happier people among all the
people who had been created by the hand of God </i>(4 Nephi:15-18).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When we are feeling scourged and bruised do we remember his beckoning: Feel my
wounds; feel my pain. Jesus Christ is no stranger to troubles. His words &#8220;I have overcome the
world,&#8221; speak legions about his desire for us to receive his peace. The atonement is all about
peace. Do we turn to him for that relief, that encouragement, that blessing we so desperately
need? Remember the Savior&#8217;s words, &#8220;Be of good cheer and do not fear, for I the Lord am with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Nephi understood temptations and sin, and at times he, too, needed encouragement. He
knew that God would give &#8220;liberally to him that asketh&#8221; so he plead, 
		<i>&#8220;Awake o my soul! No
longer droop in sin. Rejoice, o my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul. . . .
Rejoice o my heart, and cry unto the Lord and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever, yea my
soul will rejoice in thee, my God and the rock of my salvation&#8221;</i> (2 Nephi 4:28). And seeking the
comfort of the spirit, <i>&#8220;O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness&#8221;</i> (2
Nephi 4:33).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>You can&#8217;t buy that robe, brothers and sisters. We earn it by righteousness. The Savior
gives it to those who trust in him, who follow him, who live true to his teachings. He knows of
the weight on our shoulders. He has taken upon Himself the weight of our worries, our
inadequacies, our sins, our pride, and our missplaced passion. For us, he endured to the very end
of his mission that we might return home to our Father in Heaven.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>That home seems a long way off right now. But our earthly home holds memories for us
that, like the scriptures, point to the peace promised by Jesus.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The tenderness of this scene painted by 19th Century artist Thomas Faed touches my
heart. It depicts the serenity and peace of an affectionate home. My favorite place in all the
world is my home. I love how the word sounds. Home. It&#8217;s soft and inviting. No harsh tones
abide. And I love how a home feels. Each is a creation of the family who lives there; it has a
personality all its own. I think of favorite moments in the home where I grew up: picking fresh
peas early in the morning, dipping chocolates, making fruit cake and singing around the piano,
ignoring the teasing of my brothers, standing on the step with a date. These are memories I love
to recall. Very simple moments-at home-with my own children and grandchildren bring me great
pleasure.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I realize it is hard for parents today to meet the demands of young and grown-extended
families. Even in homes like mine where Joe and I live without children, the pace of life can be
busy and divisive. That grueling pace for many of us is the reason our homes are so vitally
important and must be fortified with peace and stability. Homes are the fortress, impenetrable to
the storming of all kinds of forces. There is a peace that comes when families act as allies,
combining their testimonies and other resources to stand together, against the wind. On the
prairies, I remember the buffalo herds in the storm. They would turn and shoulder-to-shoulder
face the wind. They were strong and impenetrable together. Is it so with our families?</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>A peaceful home is a refuge where we learn about and experience the abundant life
provided by the Savior. It is in the home where we teach what every son and daughter of God
needs to know. We need to know order, but there is more to home and family that chores and
clean clothes. Happy, productive, healthy, faithful lives is, as President Boyd K. Packer often
explains, &#8220;a cottage industry.&#8221;</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In Luke we read the heart-rending story of the prodigal son who took his inheritance,
journeyed to a far country where he wasted his substance with riotous living. When he was
reduced to eating with the swine he &#8220;came to himself&#8221; and returned home to ask his father&#8217;s
forgiveness and shelter. James Christensen&#8217;s painting depicts the stages of the younger son&#8217;s
wandering, and features the joyful embrace he received on his return.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><i>&#8220;It is the story that could be told of so many of us,&#8221;</i> writes BYU Bible scholar Robert
Millet,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>a tale of one who left the comfort and security of a righteous home and of God
fearing parents and wandered for a season in forbidden territory.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Once wanderers hit bottom, particularly when they have been taught better...and
realize what they once had...a regular diet of love and patience and concern, a
home and community of faith that breathe security and peace into the soul...it is
fairly common for them to &#8216;come to themselves.&#8217;</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When the son returns, his parents and friends open their arms to receive him and rejoice.
All except the older brother who stayed home. It is easy for me to relate to the brother, to his
feelings of being cheated or slighted because of the welcome and gifts given to his wayward
brother. We are all good at keeping score.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The father&#8217;s acceptance and forgiveness at the reconciliation is evident in his embrace.
Look at the contrasts in the picture. Notice the disparity in the clothing of the brothers, the
tattered sackcloth and the rich, colorful velvet. See how the countenance of the brother depicts
his unrest in accepting the prodigal son. Hopefully the words of his father will bring him peace.
		<i>&#8220;Son, thou art ever with me and all that I have is thine. It was meet that we should make merry
and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is alive again; and was lost, and is found</i>&#8221; Luke
15:32).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Home. Treasure your home and your memories that live on in that setting. Peace comes
when we work at it. Every day.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>This painting by Max Lieberman entitled, &#8220;An Old Woman With Cat&#8221; shows an elderly
woman sitting in a sunny spot out of doors on a small low chair, a rug over her knees. Therese
Southgate writes</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Her face is as weathered as the wall behind her, her hair as white as the paving
stones. In her arms she cradles a black kitten. The two gaze steadily at each
other, she weary and resigned, the kitten frisky and ready to play. The mood is
somber, though hardly gloomy. Her skirt is a tapestry of color, her mood a
tapestry of life. She is at peace, all the more precious because it is a peace that
has been won by hard work; she has survived the joys and sorrows of long life
and looks without fear to whatever else the future may hold </i>(M. Therese
Southgate, M.D. Journal of the American Medical Association, April 28, 2004,
Vol. 291, No. 16).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It is hard work to bottle peaches. It is hard work to care for an active 2 year old. It is hard
work to weed a garden, to refrain from criticism, to keep a confidence, to overlook a room that&#8217;s
messy recognizing that the need for love and kindness is far more critical. But, a shelf of golden
peaches, and angelic face of a sleeping child, the promise of mature produce, peaceful, loving,
compatible relationships and a safe haven from an often cruel world transcend any amount of
labor.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>President Ezra Taft Benson says:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The price of peace is righteousness. Men and nations may loudly proclaim,
'Peace, peace,' but there shall be no peace until individuals nurture in their souls
those principles of personal purity, integrity, and character which foster the
development of peace. Peace cannot be imposed. It must come from the lives and
hearts of men. There is no other way</i> (&#8220;Purposeful Living,&#8221; Listen, A Journal of
Better Living, Jan.-Mar. 1955, p. 19.).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Prophets and poets continue to teach that it is righteous living that brings the all
important peace of mind. The outward calm of an inner conscience at peace with itself harbors
serenity, the courage and conviction of the heart, no matter the circumstances.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The first line of Edna St. Vincent Millay&#8217;s poem &#8220;Conversations at Midnight&#8221; states:<i>
&#8220;There is no peace on earth today save the peace in the heart/At home with God.&#8221;</i> Elder Russell
M. Nelson explains that many individuals don&#8217;t know where to find God and look all around
when spiritual needs arise. <i>&#8220;But,&#8221;</i> he says</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>looking to other people on the same level cannot satisfy spiritual shortages. When
the immortal spirit is starved, hunger persists for something more filling. Even
when material success comes, there is a hollow ache - if living well falls short of
living worthily, inner peace cannot be found in affluence accompanied by
spiritual privation</i> (Thou Shalt Have No Other Gods, Ensign, May 1996, p. 14).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Of course Elder Nelson is right. There is no amount of money that can buy peace. There
is no great even that can calm troubled waters. It is simple things that keep us centered and
anxious to move on. Having the calling as general Relief Society president was daunting, and I
recognized the responsibility which rested on me. When President Hinckley extended my
release, I responded, &#8220;I may not have done what another woman would have, but I have done the
best I could.&#8221; Doing my best has allowed me peaceful sleep since my release.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>And I have continued to work at the callings the Lord has given me. I am inspired by a
Relief Society President who visited an older sister in her ward. The widow responded after they
had talked for some time, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe someone as busy as you would have the time for me.&#8221;
Busy had nothing to do with it. This Relief Society sister had made a covenant and she was
abiding by that promise to the Lord. Elder Eyring has eloquently described our heart-felt service:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>You are called to represent he Savior. Your voice to testify becomes the same as
His voice, your hands to lift the same as His hands. . . Your calling is to bless
lives. That will be true even in the most ordinary tasks you are assigned. . . You
see there are no small callings to represent the Lord.</i></p>
<p>Peace comes in knowing you have done what the Lord would have you do.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I have found a calmness, a peace, even on some occasions when things did not turn out
the way they were planned. At one point during our administration we had commissioned an
author to write a historical production for a grand celebration.. In reviewing the drafts I became
increasingly disturbed. The tone was much to strident; the development not in keeping with our
message. Finally, I knew that we could not go forward as planned. I dreaded having to rescind
our agreement, but knew it must be done. I was in a turmoil over how I could charitably reject
the already completed work. We met with the author; I explained my feelings. I carried in my
hands the Lord&#8217;s trust. The project was canceled. We were left with a hole on the program but I
felt immediate relief. What I did was right and I gave thanks to the Lord for his affirmation.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I find peace in sitting beside my sisters in Relief Society who believe as I do and are
trying to do the right thing.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I find peace in partaking of the sacrament, the weekly ritual that connects me to the
Savior.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I am at peace when I have helped at a funeral, served at Welfare Square, ignored a slight
or an offensive remark.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I am at peace knowing the Gospel provide principles to prevent a fractured life or reshape
one coming back into the fold.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I find great peace in following the prophet of God. President Hinckley has counseled:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Peace may be denied for a season...But God our Eternal Father will watch over
this nation and all of the civilized world who look to Him...Our strength comes
from obedience to the commandments of God. Are these perilous times? They are.
But there is no need to fear. We can have peace in our hearts and peace in our
homes </i>(Be Not Afraid,&#8221; New Era, Nov. 2001 p.9).</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>When we sing the hymn, &#8220;Sweet is the peace the gospel brings&#8221; we sing of every day
experiences lived according to God&#8217;s plan, of laughter from the kitchen on a summer afternoon,
of character built upon principles of righteousness, of families placed first and foremost, of the
spirit that swells in our hearts as we share the witness that &#8220;Jesus Christ lives.&#8221; One of the last
verses of that hymn is a fitting conclusion today:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>In patience, then, let us posses</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Our souls till he appear.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>On to our mark of calling press;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Redemption draweth near.</i></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I have come to know the Savior through his singular peace. His words, &#8220;My peace I leave
with you, my peace give I unto you&#8221; have steadied me, strengthened me and given me hope.
They have pointed me to the peace and rest that is promised in the eternities for those who are
righteous. May we be there, together, is my hope and my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ,
Amen.</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters, it is very good to be with you today. Let me also welcome you
students to second summer term and give you three pieces of advice. First, to the beginning
freshmen, make a commitment today to do the best that you can in your academic and spiritual
studies. Second, to the returning students, study harder and as an economist would say, more
efficiently. Your parents and I know you can do better. Finally, to my Econ 111 students, refer to
my first and second points and in addition, anything I say today may be included on my final
exam.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, as we&#8217;ve been taught, all true teaching is done by and through the
Holy Ghost and I pray that the Spirit will be with us here today as I share a few thoughts that
have been on my mind of late.</p>
<p>Throughout history, whenever saints would heed the word of the Lord, he commanded
them to build temples in which the ordinances of the gospel and other spiritual manifestations
pertaining to exaltation and eternal life could be administered. In ancient times the Lord directed
Moses to build a tabernacle, a portable temple, which became the center place of Israel&#8217;s
worship activities. A cloth veil divided the tabernacle into two parts, an outer compartment
containing an altar and an inner compartment known as the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies
contained only one piece of furniture, the Ark of the Testimony or Covenant. This ornate
wooden box contained the tablets of stone known as the  &#8220;Testimony,&#8221; Aaron&#8217;s rod, and a pot of
manna. Upon the ark and forming a lid was the mercy seat on which the highest atonement
known to the Jewish law was effected. The mercy seat was the place of the manifestation of
God&#8217;s glory. It was God&#8217;s throne in Israel.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt
put the testimony that I shall give thee. And there I will meet with thee and I will
commune with thee from above the mercy seat . . . of all things which I will give
thee in commandment unto the children of Israel </i>(Exodus 25: 21-22).</p>
<p>In approximately 1000 B.C. David gathered the leaders of his people unto Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Then David the king stood upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my
people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the
covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for
the building: But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name,
because thou has been a man of war, and hast shed blood. And he said unto me,
Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to
be my son, and I will be his father </i>(1 Chronicles 28: 2-3, 6).</p>
<p>Solomon&#8217;s temple was built after the model of the tabernacle with the dimensions of each
part being exactly double. This magnificent temple was completed in 991 B.C. and dedicated at
the Feast of the Tabernacle:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one
sound to be heard in praising and thanking of the Lord; and when they lifted up
their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised
the Lord saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the
house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord; So that the priests
could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had
filled the house of God</i> (2 Chronicles 5:13-14).</p>
<p>Would you turn with me to 2 Chronicles in the Old Testament? Chapter 6 contains the
dedicatory prayer offered by Solomon. Let&#8217;s begin in verse 12.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation
of Israel, and spread forth his hands: And said, O Lord God of Israel, there is no
God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and
shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts: And
if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have
sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and
supplication before thee in this house; Then hear thou from the heavens, and
forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which
thou gavest to them and to their fathers. When the rain is shut up, and there is no
rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place,
and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them; Then
hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people of
Israel, when thou has taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and
send rain upon thy land, which thou has given unto thy people for an inheritance</i>
(2 Chronicles 6:12, 14, 24-27).</p>
<p>Following the feast of the seven days, the dedication was completed. In 2 Chronicles 7:11
we read, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king&#8217;s house: and all that
came into Solomon&#8217;s heart to make in the house of the Lord, and in his own
house, he prosperously effected. And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and
said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for
an house of sacrifice. If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command
the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; If my
people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and
seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and
will forgive their sin, and will heal their land</i> (2 Chronicles 7:11-14).</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, what a great promise the Lord gave the children of Israel. If they
humbled themselves, prayed and turned away from wickedness and toward God, he would
protect them from their enemies and heal their land from drought and pestilence. I believe this
promise applies to us today as much as it did to the children of Israel. Our enemies are round
about us and our promised land - the western U.S. suffers from a severe drought. If we humble
ourselves, pray, and seek the face of God, he will protect us from our enemies, forgive our sins
and heal our land.</p>
<p>In approximately 609 B.C. Solomon&#8217;s temple was burned to the ground and destroyed by
Nebuchadnezzer, the wicked king of Babylon. I think it&#8217;s interesting that two millennia later
people in the Promised Land are still battling wicked rulers in Babylon. On the ancient site of
Solomon&#8217;s temple, the Temple of Zerubbabel was built and dedicated in 516 B.C. This temple
remained until 37 B.C. when it was partially burned during Herod&#8217;s invasion of Jerusalem. To
win popularity with the Jews Herod began rebuilding the temple in 17 B.C. Construction
continued through the Lord&#8217;s earthly life and was finally completed in 64 A.D. One of the most
prominent features of the temple was the veil that hung between the Holy Place and the Holy of
Holies. This veil was the veil that was rent at Christ&#8217;s crucifixion.</p>
<p>Of course Latter-day Saints know that temples were being built on the American
continent at exactly the same time they were being built in Jerusalem. Nephi, in approximately
588 B.C. built a temple <i>after the manner of Solomon</i> (2 Nephi 5:16). The prophet Jacob declared
the word of God from the temple in approximately 544 B.C. (Jacob 2:2), and King Benjamin
addressed the families of the church at the temple in 124 B.C. But, most significantly, the Savior
appeared to the Nephites at the temple following his ascension into heaven. The Nephites were
invited to feel the prints of the nails in His hands and feet <i>&#8220;and they did know of a surety and
did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets that should come. And
they did cry out with one accord, saying: Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God!
And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship Him&#8221; </i>(3 Nephi 11:1, 14, 15-17).
These examples bear witness to us that in times of old; temples were places of instruction, a
place where families could be strengthened, and most importantly, a place where people could
increase their faith in and testimony of the divine mission of the Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In A.D. 70, on the evening of the anniversary of the destruction of the first temple,
Herod&#8217;s temple was taken and destroyed by the Roman army of Titus, thus ending temple
building and worship by the Lord&#8217;s people for a season.</p>
<p>Following the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ in latter days, the Lord again
directed his prophets to build temples. However, unlike ancient temples, where ordinance were
performed for the living only, Jesus had prepared the way for the gospel to be preached and
ordinances performed in latter-day temples for the dead as well as the living.</p>
<p>The first temples of the Latter-days were built under the direction of the prophet Joseph
Smith. The Kirtland Ohio Temple was completed in 1836 with the beautiful Nauvoo Temple
following in 1846. Many of the keys to the restoration of the priesthood and of the eternal
ordinances were made in the Kirtland and Nauvoo Temples. With the migration and gathering of
the saints to the west, the Kirtland Temple was abandoned and reminiscent of Solomon&#8217;s temple;
the Nauvoo Temple was vandalized and destroyed by fire in 1850.</p>
<p>Additional Latter-day temples were not completed until 31 years after the completion of
the Nauvoo Temple. The first of these was the St. George Temple in 1877 followed by the Logan
Temple in 1884, the Mansi Temple in 1888 and the Salt Lake Temple in 1893, 40 years after
construction began. It was in this temple building period that President Wilford Woodruff, then
president of the Twelve Apostles, came to visit the Mormon Settlements in the Snake River
Valley. There in Iona, sensing the discouragement of the settlers, he climbed into the back of his
wagon box and issued what became known as the &#8220;Wagon Box Prophecy.&#8221; A few months ago in
devotional, Brother Orme quoted this prophecy. You may recall some of the words of President
Woodruff: <i>&#8220;Schools and colleges of higher learning shall be built to serve you that you may
learn the mysteries of God&#8217;s great universe. I see temples and meetinghouses dotting the
landscape, where the God of Israel may be worshiped in truth and in spirit&#8221;</i> (Michael Orme,
BYU-I Devotional, 20 January 2004).</p>
<p>Following a twenty-two-year respite, President Joseph F. Smith directed that the Laie,
Hawaii and Alberta, Canada temples be built. These temples were completed in 1919 and 1923.
The Mesa Arizona temple followed in 1927. Another respite caused by the great depression and
the Second World War followed. Then in 1939, on a cactus-covered sand hill bordering the
beautiful Snake River, and not far from where President Woodruff had issued his prophecy,
ground was broken for the Idaho Falls Temple, the 10<sup>th</sup> in the latter days. The cornerstone was
placed by David O. McKay in October 1940 and following a construction period of 5 years, the
temple was dedicated on September 23-25, 1945 by George Albert Smith. Let me share parts of
that dedicatory prayer with you. Pay particular attention to the promises and obligations
referenced in this prayer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

Church come to know of its beauty and of its eternal importance to them, and to
take advantage of it when they marry. May they, our Father, on the other hand,
realize fully that the glorious opportunity for eternal companionship of husband

of salvation embraces the whole of the human family; that the Gospel is universal

preaching of the Gospel of Salvation to both the living and the dead. We are most
grateful unto Thee that salvation is provided for all who desire to be saved in Thy
kingdom. May it be pleasing to Thy people to search out the genealogy of their
forebears that they may become saviors on Mount Zion by officiating in Thy
Temples for their kindred dead. We pray also that the spirit of Elijah may rest
mightily upon all peoples everywhere that they may be moved upon to gather and
make available the genealogy of their ancestors; and that Thy faithful children
may utilize Thy holy Temples in which to perform on behalf of the dead all
ordinances pertaining to their eternal exaltation. We are grateful, Heavenly
Father, that we have been permitted to rear this Temple on this beautiful spot

<p>Following completion of the Idaho Falls Temple, the church entered into a period of
unprecedented temple building. Five more temples were built in the 1950s and 60s. Four were
added in the 1970s. An astounding 25 were built in the 1980s and then of course in the mid
1990s President Hinckley began the current undertaking to make temples available to all
members of the church.</p>
<p>On December 21<sup>st</sup> 2003, at meetinghouses throughout southeast Idaho, the First
Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints announced that a temple of the
Lord would be built in Rexburg, Idaho. Although the size and other details have not yet been
given, the saints of southeast Idaho are rejoicing at this wonderful news. Let me share with you
some of the sentiments expressed by local church and other leaders.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;What a wonderful day for our community; we are just overjoyed, I feel like I am
walking in the clouds even now.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;I haven't come back down to earth yet. This announcement is a great testament
to the members here, both living and dead, who have strived to build Zion
throughout their lives,&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;It brought tears to my eyes. This has been one of the best days of my life, I'm just
so happy for so many people who are going to be blessed by this.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;We are celebrating here in Rexburg. this was as wonderful as it was
unexpected.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, I&#8217;m certain that all members of the church who are affected by this
momentous decision share these same sentiments. In my own home my wife and I were
astounded and overjoyed and could hardly wait to share the news with our extended families.
This announcement is truly a blessing from a loving Heavenly Father to the faithful saints living
in this area. However, lest we become prideful and puffed up in our hearts because of our
supposed righteousness and great accomplishments we need to remember that in addition to a
great blessing, the announcement of the Rexburg temple represents an obligation and
responsibility for each of us to  &#8220;raise the bar&#8221; and become true disciples of our Savior, Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>For inspiration, I would like to tell you the story of a man named Sergey Bubka. During
the 1983 track and field World Championships, an unknown 20-year old named Sergey Bubka
from Ukraine won the pole vault event. In 1984 Sergey broke the world record on four separate
occasions eventually reaching the height of 5.94 meters. His rapid raising of the bar fueled
speculation that the unbreakable 6-meter barrier might be breeched in the near future. It only
took Sergey until July 1985 at an international meet in Paris to accomplish this incredible feat.
Throughout his career Sergey set 35 world records, won the World Championships on six
separate occasions, earned a gold medal at the 1988 Olympics and cleared the unbreakable 6
meters in more than 44 competitions. Sergey is the reigning world record holder with a bar
height of 6.14 meters or 20 feet 1 and &#190; inches and is the only person ever to have vaulted over
20 feet. He is generally acknowledged as one of the greatest athletes of the modern era and the
greatest pole-vaulter of all time.</p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In 1996, when asked to what he ascribed his overwhelming success, Sergey responded,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Today, talent alone is not enough. You need to work very hard, you have to spend
a lot of time practicing your sport &#8211; six to seven hours daily. That is only for
training. I think that, generally, you need to live with your sport 24 hours a day.
You must think and concentrate and forget many things. Your life must be
completely different. You must say no, no, it&#8217;s not possible, maybe next time, to
outside distractions. It has to be sports, sports, and sports.</i></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, let me revise Sergey&#8217;s  &#8220;raising the bar&#8221; counsel to fit our circumstances
here in Rexburg and at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Today, church membership alone is not enough. You need to work very hard, you

religion 24 hours a day. You must think and concentrate and forget many worldly
things. Your life must be completely different. You must say no, no, it&#8217;s not
possible, maybe never, to outside distractions. It has to be the gospel, the gospel,
and the gospel.</i></p>
<p>At the October 1973 General Conference, Elder Theodore M. Burton, echoed these
sentiments.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When I speak of total commitment, I do not refer to a momentary dedication
which comes from being filled with the Spirit of God only on certain occasions
such as in this conference. I refer to daily or continuing spirit of devotion and
dedication, which comes from keeping all the commandments of God every day.
We must not pick and choose which commandment of God we will or will not
obey. Every one is important. For example, we cannot postpone genealogical
research, temple work, or missionary work until after we retire. When we accept
Jesus Christ, we accept his apostles and prophets and his total concept of
Christian living. We then gladly accept the admonition of God&#8217;s servants and
willingly have family prayer, hold family home evening, keep a year&#8217;s supply of
food on hand for emergencies, send our sons and daughters on missions, keep the
fast, pay an honest tithe, care for the poor and the needy, and are kind and
thoughtful and considerate of others. We willingly become saviors for our
families and go to the temple regularly to officiate in behalf of our kindred dead
who have sacrificed so much for us. When we therefore understand this principle
of commitment, we will realize the importance of priesthood, genealogy, and
temple work.</i></p>
<p>In the Doctrine and covenants, the prophet Joseph Smith received revelation relating to
this very topic. Turn with me to Section 20:30.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And we know that justification through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ is just and true; and we know also that sanctification through the grace of
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is just and true, to all those who love and serve
God with all their mights, minds, and strength. But there is a possibility that man
may fall from grace and depart from the living God; therefore let the church take
heed and pray always, lest they fall into temptation; yea, and even let those who
are sanctified take heed also </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 20:30-34).</p>
<p>Now, Brothers and sisters, with the announcement of a temple to be built in our midst, we
may feel justified and sanctified. But remember, there is a possibility that even the saints living
in southeast Idaho may fall from grace and depart from the living God. It is for this reason that
we must resolve to live closer to God each day and to follow his chosen prophets and apostles
more diligently than we have ever done in the past.</p>
<p>On the first Sunday in January, I had the opportunity to make a New Year&#8217;s Resolution.
This wasn&#8217;t a typical resolution to exercise more, read more books, or start a new hobby (I have
plenty of those). My resolution came in the form of a temple recommend interview. Shortly
following our block of meetings, my wife and I received a call from the ward executive
secretary. He asked if we could meet with the Bishop and a counselor to renew our recently
expired recommends. We accepted, and at the interview I had the opportunity to bear testimony
of the Savior and resolve to more fully live in harmony with the teachings of the Gospel.</p>
<p>When my wife and I were first married our stake president was a prosecuting attorney,
and when we went for temple recommend interviews we often felt like we were on trial because
of his questioning techniques. Because interviews with him could be quite intimidating, we
silently prayed on the way to the stake center for an interview with one of his counselors instead!
I will never forget how, after asking the usual recommend questions, he would lean across the
table, look you straight in the eye, and say,  &#8220;Brother Gifford, what is the one thing that will keep
you out of the Celestial kingdom?&#8221; Thoughts would race through my head and while he never
asked me to divulge what this one thing was, it certainly provided an opportunity for
introspection. I had answered  &#8220;yes&#8221; to the recommend questions and yet I obviously felt that I
had room for improvement. As my wife and I have discussed this, we realized that the one thing
that may keep us out of the celestial kingdom would certainly be something that is already
encompassed in the questions that allow us or prevent us from entering the temple.</p>
<p>For example, there is a temple recommend question that asks if there is anything in your
family that is not in harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christ. An acquaintance once confessed
during a temple recommend interview that while there was nothing amiss in his family, he was
struggling with patience with a visiting mother-in-law and hoped that the Lord would help him
to continue to keep his feelings and attitudes in harmony with the gospel. In turn, the counselor
conducting the interview confessed that he too had a visiting mother-in-law and that is why he
had willingly accepted a long list of interviews that evening. They both chuckled and then
discussed the higher law that the temple recommend interview questions imply. Are we asked if
we have patience with our in-laws in a temple recommend interview? No, but because we
acknowledge our belief in the Savior and have a testimony of him, we will ultimately align our
behavior and our attitudes so that everything we do will be a reflection of this testimony. We
may not be perfect but we know that through the atonement of Jesus Christ, he can help us to
become more perfect in our efforts to live these principles.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, have you made similar New Year&#8217;s resolutions? Are your temple
recommends current and are they used on a regular basis? If you have not yet had the
opportunity to receive your temple endowment, are you living your life in such a way that you
could enter the temple at any time or are you living your life with an  &#8220;eat, drink and be merry
attitude&#8221; of  &#8220;play really hard, pay my tithing later and wear immodest clothing for tomorrow I&#8217;ll
be an adult and then I&#8217;ll be responsible.&#8221; Just because you&#8217;re legally an adult does not mean you
automatically become a spiritual adult - it takes great commitment and dedication to living the
principles of the gospel. Becoming and staying temple worthy, regardless of when you will
actually be able to enter the temple to participate in all of the saving ordinances, will be a great
blessing and strength to you.</p>
<p>In speaking about the temple worthiness, President Howard W. Hunter stated,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Lord desires that his people be a temple-motivated people. It would be the
deepest desire of my heart to have every member of the Church be temple worthy.
I would hope that every adult member would be worthy of &#8211; and carry &#8211; a current
temple recommend, even if proximity to a temple does not allow immediate or
frequent use of it.</i></p>
<p>I had the opportunity a few years ago to conduct a temple recommend interview for a
homebound elderly sister. Though she could not use her recommend, she insisted that it be
current. When she passed away shortly thereafter, I was grateful she had diligently followed
President Hunter&#8217;s counsel and would pass through the veil with a current recommend. 
		</p>
<p>President Hunter also suggests that the temple is a symbol of our discipleship. He stated,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>To have the temple indeed be a symbol unto us, we must desire it to be so. We
must live worthy to enter the temple. We must keep the commandments of our
Lord. If we can pattern our life after the Master, and take his teaching and
example as the supreme pattern for our own, we will not find it difficult to be
temple worthy, to be consistent and loyal in every walk of life, for we will be
committed to a single, sacred standard of conduct and belief. The ability to stand
by one&#8217;s principles, to live with integrity and faith according to one&#8217;s belief &#8211; that
is what matters. That devotion to true principle &#8211; in our individual lives, in our
homes and families, and in all places that we meet and influence other people &#8211;
that devotion is what God is ultimately requesting of us. It requires commitment &#8211;
whole-souled, deeply held, eternally cherished commitment to the principles we
know to be true in the commandments God has given. If we will be true and
faithful to the Lord&#8217;s principles, then we will always be temple worthy, and the
Lord and his holy temples will be great symbols of our discipleship with him.</i></p>
<p>The privilege and blessing of having a temple just minutes from our homes also brings
with it great family obligations. In the October 2002 general conference, Elder M. Russell
Ballard gave a talk about  &#8220;raising the bar&#8221; in missionary work. He admonished us that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>This isn&#8217;t a time for spiritual weaklings. We cannot send you on a mission to be
reactivated, reformed, or to receive a testimony. We just don&#8217;t have time for that.
We need you to be filled with faith, hope, charity, and love, with an eye single to
the glory of God.</i></p>
<p>As I listened to this talk I quickly realized that as the father of three young sons, my wife
and I have the huge responsibility to help them become spiritually strong. As the time comes for
them to leave our home they should be young men  &#8220;with an eye single to the glory of god&#8221; who
can work hard and who are prepared to make and keep sacred covenants in the temple. Elder
Ballard states:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If we are raising the bar for your sons to serve as missionaries, we are raising the
bar for you. If we expect more of them, that means we expect more of you and
your wife. Helaman&#8217;s stripling warriors were faithful because &#8216;they had been
taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him&#8217; and
that instruction came in their homes.</i></p>
<p>When we speak of raising the bar it may be easy to defend ourselves by saying we&#8217;re
already doing the best we can, the Lord can&#8217;t expect any more from us. Several years ago the
Ensign featured a story about a woman who was serving in a very time-consuming leadership
position in her ward. She was also the mother of a large and busy family. She felt a lot of
pressure to do well both at home and in her church calling and began to feel overwhelmed and
resentful of all of her heavy responsibilities. One Sunday morning during ward council, the
Bishop suggested that the leaders of the ward were not doing as much as they possibly could and
asked them to re-dedicate themselves to their callings and to put more effort into doing the very
best they could do. This sister left the meeting very angry with the Bishop for implying that she
wasn&#8217;t doing her best in her church job. She prayed for help in dealing with her anger and as she
prayed her heart was softened to realize that perhaps she wasn&#8217;t doing things to the best of her
ability. For the next several days she continued praying, this time not asking the Lord to forgive
the Bishop, but to help her understand what she could do better. She was filled with inspiration
for ways she could improve not only as a leader in the ward, but also as a leader in her home.
She learned how she could manage her time more efficiently, delegate to counselors and family
members, and become more organized so that she could work smarter, not harder. She felt a
renewed enthusiasm for all of her responsibilities and felt more dedicated in her service to the
Lord.</p>
<p>In our efforts to be good students, work, raise children, serve in the church, etc., we may
also feel overwhelmed because there is much to do. We needn&#8217;t feel inadequate or defensive
when we talk of raising the bar. The Lord wants us to be successful in our efforts and he will
help us know what we can do to work smarter, not harder. By taking our problems and ideas to
the Lord, he will guide us and help us prioritize our lives so that we can become better without
becoming overly burdened or frustrated. </p>
<p>President Bednar, at a recent meeting, told the employees of BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho that perhaps one
of the reasons a temple was being built in Rexburg was to help us combine spiritual and temporal
learning. President Ezra Taft Benson said,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We must balance our secular learning with spiritual learning. Young adults
enrolled in universities or colleges should avail themselves of the opportunity to
take institute or religion courses, or if attending a Church school, should take at
least one religion course every term. Joining our spiritual education to our
secular learning will help us keep focused on the things that matter most in this
life. </i>(Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson p. 265).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">President Spencer W. Kimball taught:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Can you see that the spiritual knowledge may be complemented with the secular
in this life and on for eternities but that the secular without the foundation of the
spiritual is but like the foam upon the milk, the fleeting shadow? Do not be
deceived! One need not choose between the two but only as to the sequence, for
there is opportunity for one to get both simultaneously</i> (Ezra Taft Benson p. 266).</p>
<p>Allow me to interject an example of the need to balance secular and spiritual learning. A
man who was serving in a campus bishopric shared the following story. A young man in his
ward was attending a Sunday evening fireside and bragged to the group that he hadn&#8217;t studied for
an exam the following morning, but because he was in attendance at the fireside, he knew the
Lord would bless him to be successful on his test because he had chosen to do the right thing by
attending the fireside. These comments disturbed this Bishopric member greatly and he
discussed with this young man the overwhelming obligation he has to be successful in his
schoolwork. Perhaps with a little planning and effort this young man should have spent Saturday
studying for his test, rather than relying on the Lord to help him with something he was utterly
unprepared to do. You students also have this same overwhelming obligation. This is the time to
prepare for your future and you must do all in your power to ensure that you are highly qualified
to meet the challenges of life in an honorable manner. The Lord will bless you for your efforts,
but he will not bless you to be successful in those areas where you are lacking serious effort and
self-discipline. The temptation to hang out with that cute ward member is great, but the Lord will
not bless you to do well on assignments that you simply have not studied for because you are
following the commandment to find an eternal companion. The Lord will not help you get a 4.0
GPA because you are serving as the Elders Quorum president. What the Lord will do, however,
is help you learn the discipline necessary to manage your time wisely. Perhaps you will have to
choose to stay at the library and get all your homework done before ever heading home to that
cute ward member. He will help you learn to plan ahead so that you will study for your test next
week a little each evening this week in order to be able to attend the fireside on Sunday night.
Great blessings will come to you in your life if you learn to prioritize your time. Setting aside
time each day for scripture study will be a great benefit to your schoolwork not only because you
will be better managing your time, but because you will be blessed with the spirit to guide and
help you make good choices during the day. I can assure you that with proper planning and
willpower, you will be successful in your schooling and in your spiritual and social endeavors.
They need not be mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>How blessed and obligated we will be to have a temple near an institution of higher
learning such as this, where we will have greater access to the spiritual truths that are learned in
the temple and a balance to our secular learning. This joining of heaven and earth, was taught by
the apostle Paul in an epistle to the saints at Ephesus. <i>&#8220;Having made known unto us the mystery
of his will&#8230;That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all
things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth&#8221;</i> (Ephesians 1:9-10).</p>
<p>In our dispensation, President Howard W. Hunter said it best:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Temples are sacred for the closest communion between the Lord and those
receiving the highest and most sacred ordinances of the holy priesthood. It is in
the temple that things of the earth are joined with the things of heaven. The things
of earth will become one with the things of heaven. The great family of God will
be united through the saving ordinances of the gospel. Vicarious work for the
dead and ordinances for the living are the purposes of temples.</i></p>
<p>I testify that Temples are houses of the Lord, the most sacred structures on the earth. In
these temples faithful church members learn eternal truths, receive sacred ordinances such as
eternal marriage and sealing, and provide these same ordinances for those who have died without
the opportunity. As in ancient times, building and properly using temples is one of the
characteristics of the Lord&#8217;s true church. I pray, as Solomon of old, that we may humble
ourselves and seek the face of the Lord through prayer and temple worship, and become justified
and sanctified in anticipation of the building of the Rexburg temple. In the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.</p>

<p>These are the<i> squares</i>. They enjoy living all by themselves in Square City.</p>
<p>These are the 
		<i>circles</i>. They enjoy living all by themselves in Circle Center.</p>
<p>These are the<i> triangles</i>. They enjoy living all by themselves in Triangle Town.</p>
<p>Here are the 
		<i>rectangles</i>. They enjoy living all by themselves in Rectangle Ranch.</p>
<p>Each group of shapes thought the other groups were very strange and not as good as
themselves. After all, they thought, anyone who was different couldn&#8217;t possibly be as interesting
and beautiful as themselves. The squares felt that in order for your shape to be the best, you had
to have all four of your sides look just alike, the way all of the squares did. If you didn&#8217;t, you
certainly couldn&#8217;t do as many wonderful things as a square could &#8211; or so thought all the squares
in Square City.</p>
<p>The circles, however, felt that you must be perfectly round&#8211;like them&#8211;so you could roll
all around. If you were pointy or square or only had straight lines, you were boring and certainly
not as nice - looking as the circles were - or so thought the circles of Circle Center.</p>
<p>The rectangles felt that to be really important and nice looking, you must have two short
sides exactly alike and two long sides exactly alike. If not, you must be most confusing to look at
&#8211; or so thought the rectangles of Rectangle Ranch.</p>
<p>The triangles, on the other hand, felt that the only group to be a part of was one where
everyone had nice sharp points and only three sides. After all, what could you possibly need four
sides for &#8211; and rolling all around was just plain silly &#8211; or so thought the triangles of Triangle
Town.</p>
<p>The squares didn&#8217;t like the circles. The circles did not like the triangles. The triangles
certainly didn&#8217;t like the rectangles. And the rectangles didn&#8217;t like any of the squares. Each group
of shapes didn&#8217;t want to play with any shapes that were different from themselves. In fact, if any
other shape came near their group, they would make fun of it and chase it away!</p>
<p>One beautiful summer day, the little squares and the little circles and the little triangles
and the little rectangles went outside to play &#8211; but NOT together! While they were playing a
strange thing happened.</p>
<p>The little circles were playing on top of the hill. Some of them rolled a bit too far and
before they could stop, they had rolled right down the hill and smack into the middle of the game
that the little squares were playing. The little squares were very upset. Not only was their game
ruined, but they were mad about having the circles come rolling into THEIR playground. The
squares yelled and made faces at the circles trying to chase them away. The circles were very
frightened and tried to roll away, but they became confused and kept bumping into the little
squares.</p>
<p>The rectangles and triangles heard all the yelling and the crying. They all stopped their
playing and hurried as fast as they could to see what was happening. Soon everyone was
hollering at everyone else. It was a terrible commotion! Suddenly, a few of the little circles
became so frightened, that they leaped up into the air and came right down on top of some of the
little triangles! Oh, wonder of wonders! Everyone was absolutely quiet. No one moved, even an
inch. They just looked and looked at what had happened. The little circles and the little triangles
had made some ice cream cones &#8211; beautiful, big ice cream cones!</p>
<p>Some of the circles rushed over to get a closer look at the ice cream cones. They didn&#8217;t
even notice that they had rolled right next to a big rectangle. But then everyone began to cheer
and clap because the circles and the rectangle had made a very nice wagon! Then everyone
became very excited about their new discovery. Because there were so many different shapes,
they were able to make all kinds of new things. Everyone wanted to help, and they all had to
work together to create the special shape pictures. The squares and the circles made a train. A
little rectangle made the smokestack, and some tiny circles made the puffs of smoke. Soon they
were all working together to make a sailboat and many other fun things. Everyone was happy
and enjoyed working together. They had discovered that each shape, because it was different,
added just what was needed to make special things they could all enjoy.</p>
<p>When playtime was over, all the shapes were very glad the little circles had accidentally
rolled down the hill. It gave them all a chance to get to know each other, and to see how much
more fun it can be to play with those who seem different from yourself. They worked together to
make a lovely new house and many pretty things to go with it. Now that all the shapes had all
become friends, they didn&#8217;t want to live apart from each other, so all of the shapes moved their
little groups into their lovely new house where they could all live together, happily ever after.
They often went sailing on their new sailing ship and even renamed their new home the
Friendship Farm.</p>
<p>I tell you this story to illustrate the theme of my message today on the importance of
unity, cooperation, and living in harmony with one another. In Doctrine and Covenants 38:27 we
read: <i>&#8220;If ye are not one ye are not mine.&#8221;</i> Throughout history and in our scriptures, we can find
many examples of the importance of unity and being one. In his October 1997 conference
address, Elder Dallin H. Oaks talked about some of the great qualities of the pioneers. He
referred to their qualities of obedience, unity, and cooperation. He said: &#8220;We know of the great
examples of the Saints who responded to President Brigham Young&#8217;s call to rescue the stranded
handcart companies, or to pull up roots in settled communities and apply their talents and lives to
colonizing new areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elder Oaks explained that the pioneer legacy is a legacy of inclusion. When the Saints
were driven out of Missouri, many were so poor that they lacked teams and wagons to move.
Their Church leaders were adamant that none of the poor would be left behind. The response was
the same in the exodus from Nauvoo. At a conference of the Church in October 1845, the
membership entered into a covenant to take all the Saints with them. Thereafter, in the initial
epic struggle across Iowa, the companies that arrived first at their stopping place on the Missouri
River sent rescue wagons back toward Nauvoo to gather those who had been too poor to leave
earlier. The revelation that guided their next exodus on the trip west directed each company to<i>
&#8220;bear an equal proportion &#8230; in taking the poor, the widows, the fatherless, and the families of
those who have gone into the army&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 136:8). When the wagons and
handcarts moved west, their movement was always one of inclusion, and no day&#8217;s journey ended
until every straggler was accounted for.</p>
<p>When the Saints settled in the valleys of the mountains, they promptly established a
Perpetual Emigrating Fund to assist the poor to move from Winter Quarters, and later from the
nations of Europe. At least half of those who journeyed to join the Saints could not have come
without the help of leaders and members who were determined to include everyone who desired
to gather to Zion.</p>
<p>One of my ancestors answered the call from Brigham Young to help rescue members of
the handcart companies. Other ancestors who joined the church in Europe and were able to come
to America through the benefit of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund.</p>
<p>On 22 August 1847, a month after arriving in the Salt Lake Valley, President Young and
Elder Heber C. Kimball formally asked the few Saints there some important questions that
helped shape the Church. Were the new settlers going to be motivated by narrow personal profit?
Or were they willing to act as a group and help each other? The Saints responded by formally
pledging to serve each &#8220;man, woman, and child&#8221; and not simply themselves. They also agreed to
settle on the land differently than most western settlers of the time: Homes and gardens were to
be placed on village lots, with agricultural fields and livestock nurtured outside of town up to
several miles away. The Saints would learn, play, and worship together as part of a close-knit
community. These values continue in LDS wards and stakes throughout the world.</p>
<p>You may remember President Faust telling of his great-great-grandparents who were
among those thronging the temple to receive their temple blessings on the eve of leaving Nauvoo
for their perilous trek west. In response, President Brigham Young kept the temple open late into
the night to administer the ordinances.</p>
<p>The covenants and ordinances given to the Latter-day Saints involved gospel principles
of obedience and sacrifice, purity and consecration. Making these covenants helped prepare them
spiritually to endure their journey to Zion. President Faust taught that like the early pioneers,
when we receive the covenants and ordinances of the gospel, we too begin a journey toward
Zion - for Zion is not only a place, it is also a Christ like purity of heart (see Doctrine and
Covenants 97:21). The ordinances not only help us become pure as persons but also unite us as a
people. In the days of Enoch, <i>&#8220;the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart
and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them&#8221;</i> (Moses 7:18). It
was in this spirit of unity, President Faust said, that most of the pioneers came to the mountains
of the American West. The Saints were organized into companies, with a covenant to keep the
Lord&#8217;s commandments. Each company had its own captain, and all travelers shared equally in
the resources of the wagon train so the <i>&#8220;poor, the widows, [and] the fatherless&#8221;</i> would not suffer
(see Doctrine and Covenants 136:6&#8211;8).</p>
<p>The family of Mary Goble Pay, (President Faust&#8217;s ancestor) who was 13 years of age,
owned an ox team and wagon but promised to stay with two handcart companies. Though a
handcart could usually travel faster than a wagon pulled by oxen, when the pioneers&#8217; strength
began to fail as early snowstorms engulfed the group, the ox team could have forged ahead. But
&#8220;we had orders not to pass the handcart companies,&#8221; Mary wrote. &#8220;We had to keep close to them
to help if we could.&#8221; Gospel covenants bound them to their fellow Saints, and they were<i> &#8220;willing
to bear one another&#8217;s burdens&#8221;</i> (see Mosiah 18:8&#8211;10). At great sacrifice, they stayed with the
handcarts, helping as best they could. Mary&#8217;s sister, brother, and mother died from exposure,
illness, and lack of nourishment.</p>
<p>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, in his October 1997 conference address, talked about valued
companions. One group of valued companions he referred to was the handcart companies. He
said: &#8220;Our pioneer celebrations have reminded us of the strength that our forebears found in
working together. They had a great spirit of cooperation. It took a companionship to pull their
handcarts. These wagon trains and handcart companies were communities on wheels. By
revealed design the pioneers traveled in well-organized companies with clear lines of
responsibility. The strong helped bear the burdens of the weak. Through the spirit of cooperation
they overcame great hardship and established Zion in the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of our assignments in the Church are shared with companions. Ever since the Lord
sent out His disciples two by two, companionships have advanced the work of the Kingdom.
Elder Wirthlin also referred to the valued companionships of home teachers and visiting teachers
in watching over the members of the church. Each of us have the opportunity to serve as home
teachers or visiting teachers in serving our friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>Elder Russell M. Nelson, in his April 1994 conference address said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>On every continent and across isles of the sea, the faithful are being gathered into
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Differences in cultural
background, language, gender, and facial features fade into insignificance as
members lose themselves in service to their beloved Savior. Paul&#8217;s declaration in
Hebrews is being fulfilled. He said: &#8220;As many of you as have been baptized into
Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond
nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Elder Nelson said: 
		<i>&#8220;Only the comprehension of the true Fatherhood of God can bring
full appreciation of the true brotherhood of man. That understanding inspires desire to build
bridges of cooperation instead of walls of segregation.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The ancient moralist Aesop used to illustrate the strength of synergism by holding up one
stick and asking for a volunteer among his listeners who thought he could break it. Of course, the
volunteer was able to break one stick easily. Then Aesop would put more sticks together until
the volunteer was unable to break them. The moral to Aesop&#8217;s demonstration was simple:
Together we generate synergism, which makes us much stronger than when we stand alone.</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball, in a conference address, talked about Becoming the Pure
in Heart. He said: <i>Zion is &#8220;every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things
with an eye single to the glory of God&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenants 82:19). As I understand these
matters, he said, Zion can be established only by those who are pure in heart, and who labor for
Zion, for &#8220;the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money they shall perish&#8221;
		</i>(2 Nephi 26:31).</p>
<p>President Kimball said as important as it is to have this vision in mind, defining and
describing Zion will not bring it about. That can only be done through consistent and concerted
daily effort by every single member of the Church. No matter what the cost in toil or sacrifice,
we must &#8220;do it.&#8221; That is one of my favorite phrases: &#8220;Do It.&#8221; He then suggested three
fundamental things we must do if we are to &#8220;bring again Zion,&#8221; three things for which we who
labor for Zion must commit ourselves.</p>
<p>First, we must eliminate the individual tendency to selfishness that snares the soul,
shrinks the heart, and darkens the mind.</p>
<p>Second, we must cooperate completely and work in harmony one with the other. There
must be unanimity in our decisions and unity in our actions. After pleading with the Saints to &#8220;let
every man esteem his brother as himself&#8221; in Doctrine and Covenants 38, the Lord concludes his
instructions on cooperation: <i>&#8220;Behold, this I have given unto you as a parable, and it is even as I
am. I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants
38:27).</p>
<p>Third, 
		President Kimball said, we must sacrifice whatever is required by the Lord. We
begin by offering a &#8220;broken heart and a contrite spirit.&#8221; We follow this by giving our best effort
in our assigned fields of labor and in our callings. We learn our duty and execute it fully. Finally,
we consecrate our time, talents, and means as called upon by our file leaders and as prompted by
the whisperings of the Spirit. In the Church, we can give expression to every ability, every
righteous desire, every thoughtful impulse. Whether a volunteer, father, home teacher, bishop, or
neighbor, whether a visiting teacher, mother, homemaker, or friend - there is ample opportunity
to give our all. And as we give, we find that &#8220;sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven!&#8221; And
in the end, we learn it was no sacrifice at all.</p>
<p>Elder Hugh W. Pinnock told the following story about the blessing of being unified:</p>
<p>There were two ranchers living side by side in southwestern Montana. They bickered
and fought because each thought a rusty barbed wire fence that separated their ranches was not
the true property line. Each felt the other was encroaching upon his land. The real estate records
were unclear at the county courthouse.</p>
<p>They forbade their children to play with one another. The conflict became worse. Finally,
after years of exchanging words and threats, one of the ranchers said to himself, &#8220;Enough of
this.&#8221; He drove down the land from his place onto the county road and then down the long
driveway to his neighbor&#8217;s place.</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; his adversary asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, you take your hired men and your sons, and I&#8217;ll take mine and we&#8217;ll put the fence
wherever you&#8217;d like it. I&#8217;ve had enough of this. I want us to be friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>His raw boned neighbor softened, and tears rand down both of their faces. The neighbor
responded, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s drive to Virginia City and record that the present fence is where both of
us want the property line to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did and the problem was solved. Why? Because a neighbor wanted to be one with
the family next door.</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon, we read about Lehi who was told to take his family and leave
their home in Jerusalem. They encountered many challenges in their journey to the promised
land. In 2 Nephi 1:21, Lehi counseled his family saying,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now that my soul might have joy in you, and that my heart might leave this
world with gladness because of you, that I might not be brought down with grief
and sorrow to the grave, arise from the dust, my sons...and be determined in one
mind and in one heart, united in all things, that ye may not come down into
captivity.</i></p>
<p>Lehi knew that they must be united if they were to flourish in the promised land. We know from
our study of the Book of Mormon about the division of Lehi&#8217;s children and all the troubles
between the Nephites and Lamanites.</p>
<p>We also have the history of the Jaredite nation in the Book of Mormon. The Lord blessed
Jared, Jared&#8217;s brother, their friends and their families by not confounding their language and
taking them to a promised land. Eventually, their descendants turned against the gospel
teachings. They also turned against each other and had numerous contentions and wars to gain
power over one another. Soon the spirit of the Lord ceased to be with the people. Satan had full
power over their hearts. In the end, rather than seek peace, they chose to fight until their entire
nation had perished. Only Coriantumr remained to tell their story.</p>
<p>Are we one with our family and neighbors? Is the street or apartment complex where you
live a little more peaceful because you dwell there? Are you one as roommates &#8211; kind and
considerate of each other&#8217;s needs? When I first came to college here, the women&#8217;s dorms were
not completed so we had to double up for a few weeks. So in a four-person apartment, where two
people share a bedroom, we had bunk beds with four people sharing a bedroom and eight girls in
each apartment. It was very crowded. I grew up in a large family, sharing a big bedroom with
five sisters. I also have five brothers. So I was used to sharing space as were most of my
roommates. A few years ago, one of them came to visit me and we talked about our crowded,
crazy apartment was what a fun time we had together. I am grateful for the consideration my
roommates had for one another as I went through college and the unity we shared.</p>
<p>I would like to close with one more little parable that demonstrates how accepting
differences and living in harmony can bless our lives.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, and not so very long ago either, there grew a daisy in a hidden valley.
This daisy wasn&#8217;t so very different from other flowers except for one thing. He was very lonely
because there were no other flowers in the valley. Every night, he looked up at the moon and
stars and wondered if maybe somewhere in the big world outside there wasn&#8217;t a pretty red rose
that could keep him company.</p>
<p>One day, the daisy felt very strange, as if something wonderful was about to happen. As
he was gazing up into the sky, he saw a small pure - white seed floating down toward him. The
seed soon disappeared into the ground next to him. The daisy was quite confused and perplexed
at this happening. However, the next day, something wonderful had happened. Where the seed
had fallen, a beautiful red rose had grown. The daisy could see that this rose was a little different
from the other roses he had heard about. First, this rose had no thorns. Also, it was just a bit
more beautiful.</p>
<p>Now the daisy was very, very happy because the rose had come to keep him company.
Soon their roots began to intertwine and after a while it was hard to tell that they were two
different flowers. Sometimes, when the sun was too hot, the rose began to wither, but the daisy
shaded her with his leaves. And when the rain beat down and the daisy began to lose his petals,
the rose protected him with her red petals.</p>
<p>And so it was. All the weeds in the valley died in time . . . but the daisy and the rose lived
on together in eternal happiness.</p>
<p>In our journey through life, we have the opportunity to meet many different people,
perhaps live and work in a variety of areas and situations. We may not always choose our
traveling companions or conditions. But making and keeping our covenants and receiving the
ordinances of the gospel prepares us to assist others in our company. Let us strive to work
together to become one that we may be a Zion society.</p>

message by President Thomas S. Monson includes an experience he had before becoming a
General Authority. President J. Reuben Clark of the First Presidency invited him to his office
and asked him to read from the New Testament some touching accounts of the Savior&#8217;s love and
miracles. From Luke he read of a leper who, seeing the Master, </span><i>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;fell on his face, and besought
him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And he put forth his hand, and touched
him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (Luke 5:12-13).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">

		These and other accounts of the Redeemer touch our hearts. In such accounts we see Him
helping and loving people individually, personally. He touches one who to others is untouchable.
He rescues another from the hands of her tormenters. He leads a blind man by the hand (see
Mark 8:23). He goes out of His way to renew the faith of a grieving parent (see Mark 5:35-42).
He lifts a lame man whom most people had ignored (see John 5:2-9). Those He helped seemed
helpless and hopeless without Him. When we read of His love and care for individuals, we
remember that He knows us individually and will help each one of us. How important it is for us
to always remember the Son of God and ponder frequently on who He is and what He has done
for us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		How well do you know the Redeemer of mankind? How would you explain to someone
else who He is - for you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		Anciently the Israelites were careful not to read the name of God aloud. The Bible
Dictionary indicates that, &#8220;Jehovah was &#8216;the covenant or proper name of the God of Israel.&#8217; It
denotes the &#8216;Unchangeable One,&#8217; &#8216;the eternal I AM&#8217; (Exodus 6:3; Psalms 83:18, Isaiah. 12:2;
26:4). The original pronunciation of this name has possibly been lost, as the Jews, in reading,
never mentioned it.&#8221; To avoid pronouncing His name in former times, they substituted one of the
other names of God, usually Adonai (see Bible Dictionary, &#8220;Jehovah,&#8221; 710&#8211;11).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		Can you imagine having so much reverence for the name of the God of Israel that you
never, ever pronounced His name aloud? If you could not speak His name, how would you refer
to Him? How would you describe who He is? What name or expression would you use?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		One way we can come to know the Lord better is through studying the names and titles
used for Him in the scriptures. The writers of scripture used many names, titles, and descriptions
to refer to the Son of God. In many cases they seemed to use the name or title that reinforced the
doctrine they were teaching or the action they were encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		For example, the expression &#8220;the Holy One of Israel&#8221; emphasizes His sanctity and should
inspire our reverence and respect. It also recalls His miraculous deliverance of ancient and
modern Israel, His covenant people. Another expression, &#8220;the Good Shepherd,&#8221; reminds us that
He cares for and loves us as a true shepherd does his sheep (see John 10:14-15). The Good
Shepherd has a fold - the Church, a safe refuge to which He invites us. The Good Shepherd calls
after us in His own name (see Alma 5:38). He commands us to keep ravenous wolves away (see
3 Nephi 14:15).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-size: 12pt">The title &#8220;the Lamb of God&#8221; connotes His innocence and sacrifice. The Lamb, 
		</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;without
blemish and without spot&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (1 Peter 1:19), 
		</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;taketh away the sins of the world [and] is mighty to
save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (Alma 7:14). The use of the term &#8220;Lamb&#8221; must
have been particularly poignant for those who lived the law of Moses and sacrificed their lambs
in anticipation of the great and last sacrifice. And the expression &#8220;the Lamb of God&#8221; reminds us
who provided the Lamb for that great and last sacrifice.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		There are many other names or images that help us understand the Lord. For example, He
said He is the Bread of Life (see John 6:48-51). And that Bread is essential to our eternal soul,
like physical food is essential to our physical body. He said He is the vine and we are the
branches (see John 15:1-8). How does that image help you know Him better? Does it help you
understand that we need to be connected to Him to survive, just as branches must be connected
to the vine to live and to bear fruit?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-size: 12pt">In addition to the figurative language that helps us know the Messiah better, we can study
the titles that describe His place and service in the plan of happiness. King Benjamin declared
that He is </span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;the Creator of all things from the beginning&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (Mosiah 3:8),
		</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;both in heaven and in
earth&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (Mosiah 4:9). Lehi referred to Him as
		</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;the great Mediator of all men&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (2 Nephi 2:27).
The Father gave Him </span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;power to make intercession for the children of men,&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> to stand 
		</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;betwixt
them and justice&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (Mosiah 15:8&#8211;9), to be our Advocate with the Father and plead our cause
before Him (see Doctrine and Covenants 45:3).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		The Savior of the world is called the Messiah, the Anointed One, because He was chosen
and prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem His people (see Ether 3:14). With each
name or image, we learn something more about who He is. Each name or image expresses
specific aspects of His character or mission. As we study and ponder His many names, we can
learn more about Him and come to know Him better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-size: 12pt">Today we pray to the Father in the name of His Son, and perform priesthood ordinances
and preach and teach and worship in His name. But, if you were not allowed to pronounce His
name aloud, what expression would </span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">you</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> use to speak of Him? How would 
		</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">you</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> refer to the Lord
God Omnipotent (Mosiah 3:5), the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world (Revelation
13:8), the Author and Finisher of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), the Keeper of the gate (2 Nephi
9:41)?</span></span></p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Remember the Rock of Our Salvation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		The names and titles used to describe the Lord not only help us come to know Him
better, they also help us remember Him more frequently and more vividly. To demonstrate this I
would like to explore how the image of a rock helps us remember Him as our foundation and
source of strength, safety, and happiness. This image is especially rich because it helps us call to
mind several ways in which the chief cornerstone has helped us. Here are five examples:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-size: 12pt">1. He is called the Rock of our salvation, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation. As a
cornerstone provides the principal foundation of a building, the Creator is the foundation or basis
of our life here and hereafter. The Psalmist exclaimed, </span><i>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;He only is my rock and my salvation . . .
; I shall not be moved&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (Psalm 62:6).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-size: 12pt">2. A rock may be used to provide physical strength to a structure for our safety and refuge; so too
the Master and His teachings provide us with spiritual safety and refuge. The Psalmist continued,
		</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (Psalm
62:7).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">3. Just as a house built on a rock does not fall in a storm, a person who builds his or her life on
faith in the Son of God and on obedience to His word will not fall, regardless of trials,
temptations, and troubles. Helaman said,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.505833in; margin-right: 0.505833in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">Remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the
Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send
forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and
his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you
down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are
built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot
fall</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (Helaman 5:12).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-size: 12pt">4. The water that poured out of the rock in the desert at Horeb preserved the lives of the ancient
Israelites (see Exodus 17:6); the God of Israel is the fountain of all righteousness and grants us
living water </span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;springing up into everlasting life&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (John 4:14). Paul explained to the Corinthians,
		</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;And [they] did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that
followed them: and that Rock was Christ&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (1 Corinthians 10:4).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-size: 12pt">5. A rock in a pathway can cause the careless to stumble and fall; the disobedient stumble and
fall when they disregard the </span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;Word, even the Son&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (JST John 1:16). Peter warned,
		</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;[He is] a
stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being
disobedient&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (1 Peter 2:8).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		At the Church Printing Center in Salt Lake City, we have a physical reminder of the
importance of building on a rock-solid foundation. Recently a new press was installed at the
printing center. It is a web press - a huge machine whose total weight is more than 275,000
pounds. It is called a web press because paper is fed through the five-color printing process from
huge rolls rather than in individual sheets. As the paper winds through the process, each primary
color is applied one at a time: first yellow, then cyan or blue, then magenta or red, then black,
then a final color as necessary. The accurate combination of these colors produces images in full
color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-size: 12pt">Picture the scene: paper 38 inches wide, fed from huge rolls, traveling through a complex
system of printing at a speed of 2,250 feet per minute (about 25 miles per hour). That is fast
enough to print 760,000 copies of the monthly edition of the </span><i>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">Ensign</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> in just under three days. A
crucial factor in the process is that the registration, or alignment, of the paper and the ink must be
precise, to tolerance levels of much less than one millimeter. Any external vibration can foil the
entire process. The only way such a web press can function properly is if it is planted on a firm
base, a sure foundation.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		When the current press was installed, construction workers first had to remove the
previous floor because it was not strong enough to support the new press. The new base consists
of 36 inches of thick, heavily reinforced concrete. On such a solid foundation, the web press
stands firm and produces clear, high quality, full-color publications. Without a solid foundation,
the output would be, at best, a blur of colors in unfocused images.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		We learn two important things from the installation of the Church&#8217;s new press: (1) the
foundation must be put in place first, and (2) the foundation is the source of strength and support
ever after.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-size: 12pt">In our Heavenly Father&#8217;s plan for our eternal life and happiness, One had to be chosen
&#8220;from the beginning&#8221; to provide the foundation of our faith and hope and to be the source of our
strength and support: </span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;Behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the
beginning, said unto me - Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (Moses 4:2).
		</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;Here am I, send me&#8221; 
		</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt">(Abraham 3:27). The foundation of our faith is captured in this teaching
of Joseph Smith, the Prophet of the Restoration: </span><i>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">&#8220;The fundamental principles of our religion are
the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried,
and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to
our religion are only appendages to it&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> (</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt"> sel. Joseph
Fielding Smith [1976], 121).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		A little more than a year ago, my father passed away. The day after his passing, my
mother, brothers, sister, and I made the necessary visit to the mortuary to make the funeral
arrangements and choose a casket and a vault into which the casket would be placed. You may
know that our practice today is not to place the casket directly into the bare ground but to put it
first in a vault made of concrete or fiberglass. As we considered the options, I noticed a sales
pamphlet promoting a certain vault. Among other things, it claimed the vault was self-sealing
and that the seal was guaranteed for 75 years. That guarantee amused me. I wondered who would
check on the seal 75 years later. And if someone did check on the seal, and it had failed, who
would have the right to collect on the guarantee? Later on I continued to wonder, &#8220;What are the
chances the seal would really hold?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		In a thoughtful moment, my mind was directed to a vault described in Matthew chapter
27, beginning with verse 62. This vault, a sepulchre in a distant time and place, had an opening
that was covered by a great stone:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.505833in; margin-right: 0.505833in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><i>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his

		On February 4, 1976, at approximately 3:00 a.m., the country of Guatemala was
devastated by an earthquake rated 7.5 on the Richter scale. Approximately 25,000 people were
killed, most of them when the unreinforced adobe walls of their small homes fell on them in their
sleep. The Church&#8217;s meetinghouse in the town of Patzicia was well built, not of adobe, but of
reinforced concrete footings and reinforced cinder block walls. Painted white, it, like many of
our church buildings, stood as a symbol of purity and truth and strength. Yet even though this
meetinghouse appeared to be stable, it too was destroyed by the earthquake. Although the
foundation was firm and the reinforced walls did not fall, the roof split down the middle, the full
length of the building, and caved in. A missionary who had been sleeping on the stage was
trapped beneath the fallen roof for more than five hours. Through a heroic rescue, the faith and
prayers of many, and the miraculous fulfillment of priesthood blessings, the elder survived the
earthquake and eventually stood again to preach the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">
		Why, do you suppose, did that building made of excellent materials collapse? Careful
examination later showed that the roof had not been anchored or tied adequately to the
supporting walls. Because of this, the violent movements of the earthquake caused the roof to
shift from the supporting walls and crash to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
<span style="font-size: 12pt">Like the roof of the Patzicia chapel, many of us may give the outward appearance of
being built on a sure foundation. However, if we are not firmly bound to that foundation - the
Son of the living God - we do not feel secure and at peace in good times, nor do we have the
confidence to stand firm when troubles befall. Some of you have already experienced such
troubles: perhaps death has separated you from your father or mother, or you may have suffered
the agony of a brother or sister gone astray or met with temptation or illness or disability or some
other of a thousand trials. For others, your personal earthquakes still await. Those whose faith in
the Lord is firm and whose lives are in order He gladdens with this hope: </span>

		The Saints who built the original Nauvoo Temple are an example of cleaving to the Lord
through serving Him valiantly. The principal building material used in the construction of the
temple was native grayish-white, fine-grained limestone. It resembled marble and was of
excellent quality. Stones varied in size, depending on their use. Some may have weighed as
much as two tons.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt">After the city of Nauvoo was divided into 10 wards, each ward sent a crew to work on the

<p>It is good to be with you today. I can&#8217;t think of anything more enjoyable than to discuss with you
possible future happenings in the computer area. Let&#8217;s take a few minutes to talk about Moore&#8217;s
Law and how it relates to the Petaflop Imperative. Then let&#8217;s touch on the area of Quantum
Computers and the tremendous need our country has for mathematicians and physicists to
possibly help make it become a reality. A newer application called RFID, which stands for Radio
Frequency Identification, is currently being implemented in the business world. It can be a form
of wireless communication.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be using three terms that are almost beyond our imagination - let alone the ability to
understand them. I thought if I talked about them first, then used them in context, it would make
it easier to follow at least part of what I am talking about.</p>
<p>First, the word <i>teraflops</i> (Web definitions for TeraFLOP. Ask Google what is TeraFLOP?) refers
to the ability of computers to process information. A teraflop means a trillion operations per
second. I&#8217;ve though about this for a while and tried to come up with some kind of analogy that
would make understanding this type of speed easier. If I were able to talk at teraflops speed, you
would go home with libraries - not one but many - of information from today&#8217;s forum.</p>
<p>The normal person speaks at about 150 words a minute. Dividing 150 words by 60 would give
me about 2.5 words per second. I then need to determine how many seconds I will be speaking
so I can multiply 35 minutes by 60 which is about 2100 seconds. Two and a half words per
second for 2100 seconds will result in approximately 5,250 words during this forum time. That&#8217;s
nearly eight pages - single spaced - of information. That&#8217;s normal speaking. If I were to shift
gears into teraflops, I would need to present 2100 teraflops (2100 trillion words) of information.
As I&#8217;ve done my math, I think you would be taking home several billion books from just 35
minutes of time. Aren&#8217;t you glad I&#8217;m not shifting into teraflops speed?</p>
<p>The next step up in speed is a <i>petaflop</i> (Web definition of Peta-Flop). A petaflop is a thousand
trillion operations per second. Another way of saying this is one quadrillion mathematical
computations per second.</p>
<p>A <i>nanosecond</i> (Web definition of Nanosecond) is one billionth of a second. Currently, many
computer operations, such as the speed of memory chips, are measured in nanoseconds. You are
always hearing people respond when asked to hurry, &#8220;Just a second.&#8221; Can you imagine how fast
they would come if they could travel at nanosecond speed?</p>
<p>I wish we had time to discuss some of the fun gadgets that are being developed and used such as
InfoCharms (www.inc.com/articles/2000/03/17986.htm) sometimes referred to as wearables,
new mouse capabilities, and contributions in the computer area made by science fiction authors.
I can&#8217;t think of a career or profession in this day and age that doesn&#8217;t use computers and take
advantage of their capabilities. As a result, there are, of course, as many future computer
applications as there are careers. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, Global positioning
systems (GPS), and so on are all topics that probably should have been addressed as well. There
is no way, however, in the time we have today to touch on all of these areas. The future of
computers encompasses the world and interacts with just about everything in the world.</p>
<p>Since the development of the first computer, refinements have been made. There was a major
change when we moved from vacuum tubes to transistors. However, the same procedures and
processes were used. With each succeeding generation, computers have become faster, more
economical, and more powerful. Technologically, however, we are basically doing the same
thing that we did with the very first computer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Moore&#8217;s Law</span></p>
<p>In 1965 Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, observed that the number of transistors per square
inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since the integrated circuit replaced the
vacuum tube. Moore predicted that this trend would continue for the foreseeable future. In
subsequent years, the pace slowed down a bit, but data density has still doubled approximately
every 18 months without additional cost. Since this doubling phenomenon has continued from
the time Moore made his observation, it has been referred to as Moore&#8217;s Law (Web definition of
Moore&#8217;s Law). Most experts, including Moore himself, expect Moore&#8217;s Law to hold for at least
another two decades (approximately 15 - 20 years) but feel that eventually we will not be able to
miniaturize any further - that something new must be invented if the trend of faster, more
powerful, and more economical computers is to continue.</p>
<p>We are told that <i>&#8220;Engineers no doubt will continue wringing performance gains out of silicon

hold back performance&#8221;</i> (Aaron Ricadela, &#8220;Quantum&#8217;s&#8221;,

<p>Currently the world&#8217;s five fastest supercomputers (Aaron Ricadela, &#8220;Petaflop Imperative,&#8221;
		<i>Informationweek</i>, June 21, 2004, pp. 55-62), according to a new survey are:</p>
<p>* First, the Earth simulator which is a 35.9 teraflops machine. It was created by NEC and is
housed in the Earth Simulator Center in Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p>* Second, the Thunder supercomputer runs at 19.9 teraflops. It was made by Digital Corp., and
can be found at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab located in California.</p>
<p>* Third, the ASCI Q computer can calculate at the speed of 13.9 teraflops. It was made by
Hewlett-Packard Company and is used by the Los Alamos National Lab in California.</p>
<p>* Fourth, Blue Gene/L is an 11.7 teraflops machine made by IBM. It can be found at the Watson
Research Center in New York.</p>
<p>* Fifth, the Tungsten computer operates at 9.8 teraflops. It was created by Dell computers and is
used at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in Illinois.</p>
<p>A <i>teraflop</i> refers to <i>a trillion operations per second </i>(See Note 1). Tera is a prefix indicating 10
to the power of 12 which is a trillion. FLOPS are floating-point operations per second. The Earth
simulator in Japan today handles almost 40 teraflops per second - 40 trillion operations per
second.</p>

the first year or two of two thousand. However, because of the tremendous possibilities of using
quantum physics as far as speed and accuracy go as well as once again becoming more
competitive with Japan, the government has decided to fund research on this computer to the
tune of $2.8 billion (<i>Ibid. </i>p. 42). This amount is in addition to the funding being given to

<p>Quantum computing is largely theoretical. <i>&#8220;If it works, quantum computing could provide such

<p>The notion of constructing a computer that behaved according to the laws of quantum physics
arose in the early 1980&#8217;s, when the late Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner at the California
Institute of Technology, postulated that the only way to simulate a quantum mechanical system -
one in which particles can spin clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time - was with a
computer that itself behaved that way (<i>Ibid. p. 46</i>).</p>
<p>A big breakthrough came in 1994 when Peter Shor, a researcher at AT&amp;T&#8217;s Bell Labs in New
Jersey, showed in an algorithm how a quantum computer theoretically could quickly find the
factors of large numbers. Since the codes that protect military and financial secrets are based on
the inability to do that, government money began flowing into quantum-computing research
(<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no agreement about the best way to build a quantum computer. Experiments by Isaac
Chuang and Neil Gershenfeld at MIT and David Winland at NIST use atoms or charged ions in
an electro-magnetic trap, while IBM is testing superconducting materials that can generate
quantum bits.</p>
<p>Researchers estimate it would take a quantum computer of 100,000 calculating atoms to perform
work that&#8217;s beyond the reach of today&#8217;s most-powerful computers, such as breaking the 128-bit

extremely low energy levels. Experiments at MIT and the National Institute of

quickly the factors of numbers hundreds of digits long, a feat that would take

<p>The most advanced quantum computers have not gone beyond manipulating more than seven
qubits, meaning that they are still at the &#8220;1 + 1&#8221; stage (Kevin Bonsor, &#8220;How Quantum Computers

<p>Quantum objects, such as electrons and other subatomic particles can be thought of as existing in
multiple states simultaneously: &#8220;up&#8221; as well as &#8220;down&#8221; . . . &#8220;1&#8221; as well as &#8220;0&#8221;. This idea of
existing in multiple states simultaneously is a property known as &#8220;<i>superposition</i>,&#8221; and opens the
way to a completely different approach to computing. In this approach, one quantum bit enables
you to manipulate two values at the same time. As you string together more and more qubits, the
power grows exponentially. If you link two qubits together, you can work with four values at the
same time. Three qubits can work with eight values, and so on. If you can get up to 40 qubits,
you could work with <i>more than a trillion values simultaneously </i>(Alan Boyle, &#8220;Mysteries of the
University, A quantum leap in computing, 21<sup>st</sup>-century approach could be used to crack open
secrets.&#8221; MSNBC, p. 3).</p>
<p>An essential for quantum computing - is a bizarre characteristic called 
		<i>entanglement</i>. Two
quantum objects can be linked together so that if you observe the result of an interaction with
one of the objects, you can figure out what the state of the other object is as well. The
entanglement holds even if the two objects are <i>widely separated</i> (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>This makes possible an &#8220;action-at-a-distance&#8221; phenomenon often called 
		<i>quantum teleportation</i> -
a term that often leads people to think of &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; transporters. In reality, what&#8217;s being
teleported is information about a quantum object, not the object itself (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>Two people could encode information, trade it back and forth, and reconstruct the information
using entangled quantum systems. Even if eavesdroppers intercept the coded information, they
couldn&#8217;t read the message because they wouldn&#8217;t be part of the entangled 
		<span style="background-color: #ffffff">system (<i>Ibid</i>).</span></p>
<p>Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have demonstrated a quantum cryptography
scheme that works over 30 miles of optical fiber (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>Gary Fitzmire, an employee of Boeing, has been pursuing the possibilities of Quantum
computing. <i>&#8220;When we want to send data wirelessly from an F-18 or AWAC&#8217;s [Radar-surveillance plane], we think there&#8217;s some promise inside quantum computing to boost our
information assurance,&#8221;</i> Fitzmire says. <i>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want these signals jammed or eavesdropped
on&#8221; </i>(Aaron Ricadela, &#8220;Quantum&#8217;s&#8221;, <i>Informationweek</i>, May 10, 2004, p. 44).</p>
<p>Peter Shor, an award-winning mathematician at AT&amp;T Labs, says it may be possible to develop
a 30-qubit computer within the next decade - but that would be just the start. It would take
hundreds or thousands of networked qubits to solve problems beyond the capability of classical
computers (Alan Boyle, &#8220;Mysteries of the University, A quantum leap in computing, 21<sup>st</sup>-century

<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff">Quantum information has a tendency to &#8220;leak&#8221; into the outside environment, in a process known
as decoherence. Thus, the quantum system has to be isolated from outside influence as much as

that you can adapt classical error-correcting techniques to quantum systems to make them fault-tolerant (<i>Ibid</i></span>).</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; ">RFID</span></p>
<p>I decided to include RFID in my talk as an introduction to a technology that is currently being
implemented. The pedaflop computer is a down the road possibility. The Quantum computer is
an idea that needs to be explored to determine if it is even a viable alternative type computer and
determine if additional research is a good idea.</p>
<p>RFID is the acronym meaning radio frequency identification (Web definition of RFID). It refers
to the technology that uses devices attached to objects that transmit data to an RFID receiver.
These devices can be large pieces of hardware the size of a small book like those attached to
ocean containers or very small devices inserted into a label on a package. RFID has advantages
over bar codes such as the ability to hold more data, the ability to change the stored data as
processing occurs, does not require line-of-sight to transfer data, and is very effective in harsh
environments where bar code labels won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>A typical RFID system consists of a tag, a reader, and some sort of data processing equipment,
such as a computer. The reader sends a request for identification information to the tag. The tag
responds with the respective information, which the reader then forwards to the data processing
device. The tag and reader communicate with one another over an RF channel. In some systems,
the link between the reader and the computer is wireless.</p>
<p>Only a small number of consumers are aware of radio-frequency identification technology, even
after privacy groups have raised questions about its use. A survey of 1,000 consumers by
Capgemini Group and the National Retail Federation found that 77% were not familiar with
RFID. Of those that were, 42% had a favorable impression of the technology and 31% had no
opinion (Beth Bachldor &#8220;RFID? What&#8217;s That?&#8221; <i>InformationWeek</i>, June 28, 2004, p. 14).</p>
<p>Still companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble aren&#8217;t taking chances, &#8220;We realize RFID is a concern
for consumers, said Sandy Hughes, P&amp;G&#8217;s global privacy executive last week at the Federal
Trade Commission&#8217;s RFID Forum. P&amp;G is pledging to treat all RFID data the same as it does
other customer data (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>Let me give you some examples of its use:</p>
<p>Misrouted baggage costs Delta Air Lines about $100 million per year - enough for the company
to allocate $25 million to automate much of its baggage-tracking functions with radio-frequency
ID tags by 2007. The tags will be embedded in the luggage labels the airline uses to identify a
bag&#8217;s origin and destination. The labels will be scanned during check-in, loading, and unloading,
giving supervisors the ability to quickly find any given piece of luggage. The passive tags it
plans to use cost about 25 cents each, but Delta expects that price to drop to about 5 cents by the
time it&#8217;s ready to implement the project (Linda Rosencrance, &#8220;Delta to use RFID tag to track
luggage.: <i>ComputerWorld</i>. July 1, 2004. p. 1).</p>
<p>Radio-frequency identification devices in toll lanes are part of a system that will be transforming
life in California. Millions of commuters are using the E-ZPass services. Cars can zip through
the toll booths. Information from their E-ZPass tag is send to a receiver that, in turn, charges that
individual&#8217;s account for the amount of the toll (Brendan I. Koerner, &#8220;Spy Games. From Black
Boxes to GPS Devices, Your Car is Recording Your Every Move.&#8221; <i>Readers Digest</i>. July, 2004,
p. 84).</p>
<p>People, however, may sometimes forget that their movements are recorded by the radio-frequency identification tags on their windshields. Authorities can get that data with a court
order - and solve crimes. The FastTrak system monitors vehicles as they travel through the
region. Overhead detectors log the location and time of FastTrak tags on passing vehicles. The
data is encrypted to protect it from hackers, and fed into a centralized computer system. The
information helps keep traffic flowing and is used to update real-time maps on the Web (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>An important safety use of RFID tags is likely to be on tires. After faulty Firestone tires were
tied to dozens of accidents, regulators are developing a plan to require soft-tire warning systems
on future vehicles. RFID based systems could alert drivers about underinflation. By giving each
tire its own radio signature, the tags might also be useful in the event of a recall (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago the 108<sup>th</sup> Boston Marathon was 
		<span style="background-color: #ffffff">run (David M. Ewalt, &#8220;RFID In It For The
Long Run&#8221;, <i>InformationWeek</i>, May 3, 2004. p). Race </span>organizers wanted a way to track and
accurately time individual runners, as well as share their place on the course with spectators.
HP&#8217;s solution was to tie radio frequency identification chips into the shoelaces of registered
runners. Each chip contains a unique ID assigned to that a person, and when he or she runs over
special RFID-receiving mats on the raceway, the system logs the runner&#8217;s location into a
database. With that information organizers can track the progress of racers and, by comparing
the time difference between when they hit various mats, estimate their speed and predict when
they&#8217;ll finish (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>HP makes that information available in several ways - to organizers and the press on-site, and
also to friends and family. On the course, 75 volunteers armed with wirelessly connected iPaq
PDAs can answer questions and provide location information to spectators (I<i>bid</i>).</p>
<p>The service proved to be very popular. More than 180,000 alert messages were sent this year,
and the Web site served up more than seven million page views during the<span style="background-color: #ffffff"> race (<i>Ibid</i>).</span></p>
<p><i>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have any major issues, and the Web site worked flawlessly,&#8221;</i> said officials of this
race (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>The first part of May, Wal-Mart stores Inc. and eight manufactures began shipping and receiving
a limited number of cases and pallets tagged with RFID labels, marking the first real-world
implementation in Wal-Mart&#8217;s RFID trials (Laurie Sullivan, &#8220;Wal-Mart Tests RFID with Eight
Suppliers. <i>InformationWeek</i>. May 3, 2004, p. 28).</p>
<p>The trial - involving Gillette, Hewlett-Packard, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kimberly-Clark, Kraft
Foods, Nestle Purina PetCare, Proctor &amp; Gamble, and Unilever - is a step toward Wal-Mart&#8217;s
requirement that top suppliers have RFID tags on cases and pallets by January 1. It involves just
21 of more than 100,000 products carried in a typical Wal-Mart Supercenter. Tagged pallets are
being delivered to Wal-Mart&#8217;s Sanger, Texas, distribution center, where RFID readers at the
dock doors scan tags and alert Wal-Mart teams and the suppliers that the shipments arrived
(<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>Though the Wal-Mart trial focuses on pallets and cases, there will be some individually tagged
products (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>By the end of the Year, HP expects to use RFID tags on 80% to 85% of its cases and pallets
bound for retail sale (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>The most pervasive challenge is reading tags accurately. 
		<i>&#8220;It seems like read rates [on average]
are close to 70% or 75% </i>(<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>Wal-Mart is working to improve read rates, having run into problems with liquid and metal
products, says Simon Langford, manager of its RFID strategy (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>HP gets 100% accurate reads on cases and pallets, but the company had to change how it puts
pallets together to achieve that. Accuracy is more difficult when tagging individual items.
Readings on ink-jet cartridges were often inaccurate because the liquid inside absorbs RF signals
and metal on the cartridges can short out RFID readers. HP solved that problem by putting a
material between the cartridge and the tag (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>Colorpoint LLC, a $7 million-a-year greenhouse that supplies Lowe&#8217;s CosCo and Sam&#8217;s Club,
has 99.5% to 99.75% accuracy, up from 75% last year (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>The company solved some problems by replacing shipping- and receiving-dock readers - eight
times. It also needed new tuning equipment to define the radio frequencies. The multiple readers
in the warehouse disrupted each other when two or more tried to send signals simultaneously
(<i>Ibid</i>).</p>
<p>Boeing Co. and Airbus S.A.S., the world&#8217;s largest airplane makers, plan to require more than
2,000 of their suppliers to begin tagging aircraft and engine parts with radio-frequency
identification technology by this time next year (Tony Kontzer, &#8220;RFID Flies High With Airplane
Makers&#8221;, <i>InformationWeek</i>, June 14, 2004, p.&#160;28).</p>
<p>These are just a few ways that the RFID tags are being used. Businesses are finding that they can
be more accurate, handle materials faster, cut costs, and please customers. The tags are
expediting the supply chain and helping to tie businesses and suppliers closer together. 
		</p>
<p>Customers will also be a big part of this chain soon. Individuals will be able to enter the store,
pick up the items and products they want, and swipe their card as they leave - there will be no
need to individually scan or itemize products. As a person leaves the store, the tags will send
product information to the computer which will tie the products taken to that person&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>Technology is making life easier and safer, but at what cost? New tools of the digital age add to
our convenience, efficiency and instant gratification, but there&#8217;s a trade-off: The more progress
we achieve, the more of ourselves we expose. Wherever we go now and whatever we do,
someone - or something - is probably watching.</p>
<p>One of the biggest privacy issues at stake may be how much of the data gathered is available to
third parties.</p>
<p>People love the convenience and ease new technology brings. They don&#8217;t seem to mind that
money can be automatically deducted from their account for toll booths and speeding tickets.
They don&#8217;t seem to mind that they can be followed to work through traffic, but they don&#8217;t want
others to know that a night they might drive to a strip club.</p>
<p>During this time today, I&#8217;ve really only talked about three possibilities to consider in the
computers of the future - petaflop speed, quantum computers and RFIT.</p>
<p>In the near future, RFID tags are going to eventually impact every one of us. Many suppliers and
retail stores are attempting to set-up and follow standards that will allow them to track every
item they handle from its inception to manufacturer, retailer, and eventually to the individual
customer. Within the next few years this technology will be firmly in place.</p>
<p>In the next two to ten years, we will see computers working at petaflop speeds and adding
capabilities to do things that were never possible before.</p>
<p>Even further down the road - in the next 10 - 20 years, there is the possibility that Quantum
computing will become available and developed to the point where there will be a major shift in
how information is handled.</p>
<p>We live in exciting times. We are indeed a blessed generation. Thank you for your time and
interest today.</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, I have been looking forward to this day for many months now and I feel so
grateful and honored to be here. A number of my family members, including my sister, have
been students here and my uncle works in the administration, so this campus has been special to
our family for many years. Sometimes I can&#8217;t get over how blessed we are to have a university
such as this where we can discuss not only intellectual pursuits, but the weightier matters of the
spirit. Isn&#8217;t that an incredible blessing? I am so thankful for the spirit you have brought with you
and I pray for the Spirit to bless you with whatever answers and direction you have come in
search of today.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m sure you are aware, those who are invited to speak to you in this devotional setting are
asked to seek the Lord&#8217;s direction in determining the topic to be discussed. This is a very unique
and special opportunity and I want you to know that it is a responsibility I take very seriously. I
assure you that never has a group of people been prayed and fasted over with more intensity than
you have been in these past few months. One of the best parts of that experience has been my
impression of the Lord&#8217;s great love for each of you as well as His mindfulness of your concerns
and challenges.</p>
<p>As I have sought the Lord&#8217;s inspiration, I have continued to recall a particular Sunday night
during my senior year at BYU in Provo. Thankfully, my BYU experience was fairly spectacular
overall. But on this particular Sunday I had a full-blown meltdown. Graduation was around the
corner and it was dawning on me that in spite of my careful planning and diligent study - not to
mention very persistent scrutiny of my patriarchal blessing - my future was rather unsure. I had
expected to reach that point in my education having found my husband and a wonderful job that
I would enjoy until I had children. But the truth was that I didn&#8217;t have so much as a date for that
Friday night, let alone an eternal companion. Nor did I have a wonderful job to look forward to -
in fact, with no real prospects in my field I was beginning to consider something in another area
entirely. The reality was distilling on me for the first time that life doesn&#8217;t always go as we plan -
even when our goals and desires are righteously motivated.</p>
<p>Now I want you to know that I had general faith that all would be well, but to be honest I was
looking for something more concrete - something along the lines of a detailed game plan for the
following 10 years or so delivered by an angel who would then sit patiently and answer all of my
questions. (Somehow in my hour of need this didn&#8217;t seem like too much to ask.) But no such
plan arrived. I had counseled with my roommates, Family Home Evening brothers, friends,
teachers and members of our bishopric but I still didn&#8217;t have the answer I was looking for. 
		</p>
<p>It was time to call in the big guns: my parents. They were living overseas at the time and I had
hesitated for weeks to make that monumentally expensive phone call on my student budget.
However, I decided that this was an emergency and I dialed their number four or five times
zones away. I&#8217;m quite sure I woke them up, and after patiently listening for awhile, my mother
said (with just a hint of exasperation in her voice), &#8220;Staci, you are not going to be able to plan
every step of your life tonight. Stop worrying about it. You&#8217;re a righteous young woman. You&#8217;ve
just got to prepare yourself and then step out into the dark. Things will work out.&#8221; That was the
most disappointing and expensive advice I ever received from my mother! I had expected my
parents to rescue me with the details I wanted so badly to hear, but they did not - and wisely so.
In the days following our conversation, the message became more and more clear. Peace slowly
overtook my anxiety. And in the intervening years I have come to understand what she was
really talking about. <span style="text-decoration: underline">I was focused too much on that which I could not necessarily control, and
not enough on preparing myself for the opportunities that were already in the process of
unfolding under the Lord&#8217;s careful direction</span>. As it turned out, the Lord was preparing an
opportunity for me that I never in my wildest dreams could have imagined for myself - it was
completely beyond my field of vision (although interestingly, very much in line with my
desires). To this day I regret the time I wasted worrying about things the Lord had so very well
in hand.</p>
<p>As you sit here today, each of you has in your heart some idea of what you want to do with your
life and where you would like to arrive at the end of it. You are at a crossroads in your personal
journey to your own, individual promised land. That promised land is really a symbol of the
intersection of grace and works - the things you are working hard to righteously achieve
combined with the Lord&#8217;s divine enhancements that will ultimately lead to your chosen destiny.
The decisions you are making now are of eternal consequence - the significance of which is not
lost on you, I am certain, just as it was not lost on me that Sunday night just a few years ago. I
have felt impressed that perhaps some of you have similar concerns about the journey that lies
ahead and I would like to share with you five keys to aid in that journey that, if put to use, will
see us safely to our promised land:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Recognize and cultivate your righteous desires</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Prepare for the unexpected</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Accept adversity</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Practice patience</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Be active in the Church</p>
<p>I echo President Hinckley&#8217;s message of hope spoken to young women just a few months ago:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>You have the potential to become anything to which you set your mind. You have
a mind and a body and a spirit. With these three working together, you can walk
the high road that leads to achievement and happiness. But this will require effort
and sacrifice and faith&#8230;you will be expected to put forth great effort and use
your best talents to make your way to the most wonderful future of which you are
capable</i> (&#8220;Stay on the High Road,&#8221; Ensign, May 2004, p. 113).</p>
<p>How right he is! Our leaders have told us time and again that we are living in the most
challenging times in the history of the earth. As Elder Dallin H. Oaks pointed out in our most
recent general conference, we are certainly in the last days. There has perhaps never been a
generation upon whose shoulders rests more responsibility - and accountability - than yours for
bringing about all the events that will prepare the earth for the Savior&#8217;s return. In the same
general conference, President Hinckley said, <i>&#8220;We of this generation are the end harvest of all
that has gone before. It is not enough to simply be known as a member of this Church. A solemn
obligation rests upon us. Let us face it and work at it. We must live as true followers of Christ&#8221;</i>
(&#8220;The Dawning of a Brighter Day,&#8221; Ensign, May 2004, p. 84). How does that make you feel?
And how do you reconcile that great responsibility with the plans you have in motion for your
life?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk for a moment about the desires of your hearts - for they are what your personal
promised land is made of. Perhaps some of you are looking forward to serving a mission. All of
you are certainly looking forward to graduation. Some of you are preparing to marry in the
temple. Others of you have already taken this step and are in the season of raising a righteous
family. In addition to the many righteous desires that we have in common as members of the
Church, each of us has some very personal desires concerning the unique contribution we want
to make to this world with the set of gifts and talents we have been given. You may desire to
design an important building that will stand for generations, to provide life-saving medical care,
to create art that uplifts the soul, to coach a sports team and inspire your players to greatness, to
lead a company to great financial success so you will have the means to bless others - all of these
can be noble and worthwhile - and even righteous - pursuits. As long as we are living in such a
way as to be under the influence of the spirit, these desires and interests have a divine origin and
they are to be cultivated with the intent to do good and to build up the kingdom of God. Let me
not gloss over the beginning of that statement: <span style="font-weight: bold">
<i><span style="text-decoration: underline">as long as we are living in such a way as to be
under the influence of the spirit.</span></i></span> I cannot overstate the value of obedience when we are
navigating the way to our promised land.</p>
<p>As early as the second chapter of 1 Nephi we read in verse 20, <i>&#8220;And inasmuch as ye shall keep
my commandments, ye shall prosper and shall be led to a land of promise.&#8221;</i> This is repeated time
and again throughout the Book of Mormon and the rules have not changed. Life is hard enough
when we are doing our best to follow the Lord. We cannot afford the uncertainty and the misery
that unrighteousness brings. When we fail to follow the Lord&#8217;s commandments, our spiritual
insurance policy is canceled. <i>&#8220;If ye do not what I say, ye have no promise&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and
Covenants 82:10). But, as Nephi reminds his rebellious family members in 1 Nephi 7:13, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">&#8220;if it so
be that we are faithful&#8230;we shall obtain the land of promise&#8221;</span></i></span> (emphasis added). It&#8217;s really that
simple.</p>
<p>In speaking to a group of students at BYU in Provo a few years ago, President Hinckley said,
&#8220;You &#8217;re good, but it&#8217;s not enough to be good. You must be good for something!&#8221; Doesn&#8217;t that
just sound like him? He&#8217;s right &#8211; our greatest happiness is to be found not only in being good,
but in doing good. I love the scripture found in Doctrine &amp; Covenants 6:8. In it, the Lord says,<i>
&#8220;if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this generation.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Regardless of the inspired plans we make for our life, we do well to undergird those plans with a
desire to &#8220;be the means of doing much good,&#8221; with a willingness to leave the particulars to the
Lord, for that is where spiritual safety and true happiness lie. We must learn the spiritual balance
of cultivating our righteous desires and allowing the Lord to put those desires to use in perhaps
an unexpected way.</p>
<p>I love the story in the fifth chapter of Luke of the Savior teaching up in Galilee, sitting in Peter&#8217;s
fishing boat speaking to the people seated on the hillside next to the shore. When He finished
teaching, He instructed Peter to row out to the deep and let down his nets for a catch of fish.
(Now remember that Peter was a fisherman by trade. He was working in his chosen field, doing
what he had been trained to do and, presumably, what he had desired to do.) Peter said, 
		<i>&#8220;Master,
we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing, nevertheless at thy word I will let down the
net&#8221; </i>(Luke 5:5). What happened? Their net caught so many fish that it started to break. Has the
Lord ever asked you to let down your net in a place that seemed barren to you? What was your
response? &#8220;Master, I&#8217;ve been there, done that and didn&#8217;t get anything out of it?&#8221; Or, &#8220;at thy word
I will let down the net?&#8221; I have been asked to let down my net in some very unexpected places
and have always, ultimately been grateful for the results, even when they were as unexpected as
the opportunity. I invite you to consider what might happen in your life if you allowed the spirit
to direct you to &#8220;let down your net&#8221; in an unexpected place &#8211; in your education, your
professional life, your personal development &#8211; and perhaps most importantly in searching for a
companion. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">The Lord will invite us to let down our nets in unexpected ways and unexpected
places, always for our profit and learning</span>. It is my testimony that when we accept the
invitation willingly, as Peter did, miracles happen.</p>
<p>A wise person once said, &#8220;Prepare yourself and the opportunity will come.&#8221; In anticipation of a
future we do not always expect, the Lord often places interests or abilities within us to prepare us
for opportunities He has in store. It is then up to us to develop those interests. Let me give you an
example:</p>
<p>When I began my junior year at BYU I had a schedule full of music classes, a religion class and
a physical science class I had been putting off for a couple of years. Two or three days after the
start of the semester I literally woke up one morning with an overwhelming feeling that I should
register for a Russian class. This made absolutely no sense. I had already taken an upper division
Portuguese class and then tested out of my language requirement for graduation. Taking a
Russian class would do nothing to further my specific educational goals. Although I had a
significant interest in Russia, I had never been there, nor had I any hope of going. At the time,
the Berlin Wall was still standing and the Soviet Union was intact. But for a day and a half the
feeling would not leave me, so I researched the possibility of adding the class. It so happened
that Russian 101 was a 5 credit hour class and there was no way I could add 5 more credit hours
to my load. The class met daily and would require a great deal of independent study in addition
to class hours. But I knew that for whatever reason I was to take that class. So I re-arranged my
schedule, bought the text and a copy of the Book of Mormon in Russian, and began to immerse
myself in a new language, a new alphabet and a new culture. I did not by any means become
fluent in my semester of study but learned enough to engage in a very simple conversation.</p>
<p>Just one year later, the Iron Curtain fell with the collapse of the Berlin Wall and I found myself
unexpectedly in Helsinki, Finland on a tour with the BYU Young Ambassadors. International
travel had been made available to Soviets for the first time in years and I was astounded to
discover that our audiences were in large number, Russian speaking. I will never forget two
young women, Tania and Viola, who walked right up to me on the street one morning and, in
Russian, indicated that they were on vacation from St. Petersburg. They asked who we were,
where we were from and what we were doing there. How they sensed I might be able to
understand them must have been a miracle. Using Russian I never dreamed I would have the
opportunity to use, I explained that we were musicians from the United States, representing
Brigham Young University of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I invited them
to our show that evening. They accepted enthusiastically, asking for my address so I could tell
them more about who we were and what our Church was all about. I was grateful for the fluent
full-time missionaries at the show that evening who could pick up where my sketchy Russian left
off. But what if I had not followed that prompting a year before? Tania and Viola might never
have had an opportunity to hear the gospel.</p>
<p>My Russian has grown a little rusty since then, but I have no doubt that the Lord will call upon
me to dust it off and use it again. And perhaps more importantly, that experience planted an
unquenchable desire in my heart to learn to bear my testimony in as many languages as I
possibly can. I&#8217;m hoping that if I prepare myself, the opportunities will come. And since that
experience in Helsinki over ten years ago, I have had similar unexpected experiences in other
countries with other languages. Isn&#8217;t it amazing what the tiniest prompting or interest or desire
can lead us to?<span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>I urge you to be aware of them and to nurture and develop them with a spirit of open-minded
willingness to use the fruits of your studies and pursuits in the Lord&#8217;s service. His plans for us
are always more wonderful than our own. Listen to what Nephi says about building the ship that
would take his family to their promised land: <i>&#8220;Now I Nephi, did not work the timbers after the
manner which was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner of men; but I did
build it after the manner which the Lord had shown unto me&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 18:2).</p>
<p>Now the &#8220;manner of men&#8221; may be the very, very best we can do. But what about the best God
can do? The Lord has said,<i> &#8220;my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways&#8221;
		</i>(Isaiah 55:8). When we engage in a partnership with the Lord as we make our journey, we are
able to take advantage of His omniscience and His omnipotence - His vision and His power.
Doesn&#8217;t it make sense to let the one who can see everything do the leading?</p>
<p>It is important to remember that even when we are doing our best to live righteously, develop our
divinely ordained talents and gifts, and accept the Lord&#8217;s invitations to do things His way, we
will still experience times of uncertainty and adversity. How will we react? Because our spirits
crave peace, it is tempting to panic when our vision is limited for a time. But a few years ago I
heard a statement made by Elder Boyd K. Packer that has made all the difference for me. He
said,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">It was meant to be that life would be a challenge. To suffer some anxiety,
some depression, some disappointment, even some failure is normal. Teach
our members that if they have a good, miserable day once in a while, or
several in a row, to stand steady and face them. Things will straighten out.
There is great purpose in our struggle in life&#8221;</span> (<i>Ensign</i>, May 1978 p 93,
emphasis added).</p>
<p>That sounds a lot like my mother&#8217;s advice, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>How does it make you feel to hear those words? To me, they are profoundly comforting. If we
are doing all we can to live the commandments (there&#8217;s that important caveat again) and
challenges arise, we would do well to say not &#8220;what is wrong?&#8221; but &#8220;what is right?&#8221; What divine
purpose is being accomplished here? Peace comes when we learn to trust that such a purpose
exists and are willing to submit to the tutoring that such experiences offer.</p>
<p>I am amazed at the story of the Jaredites who crossed the sea on barges lit by stones that had
been touched by the finger of the Lord. The story of those stones used to be my favorite part of
the Book of Ether until a few years ago when I discovered an eye-opening truth taught in
Chapter 6. Starting in verse 6, we read <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">&#8220;And it came to pass that they were many times buried
in the depths of the sea because of the mountainous waves which broke upon them, and also
the great and terrible tempests which were caused by the fierceness of the wind&#8221;</span></i></span> (emphasis
added). It doesn&#8217;t sound like a very comfortable journey, does it? You&#8217;ll recall that the Lord had
instructed them in Chapter 2 to build air holes in both the top and bottom of those vessels. They
must have known from the start that they were in for a journey that would leave them literally
upside down from time to time. But here&#8217;s the verse that gets me every time, verse 8: 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">&#8220;And it
came to pass the wind did never cease to blow </span></i>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">towards the promised land<i>&#8221;</i></span></span> (emphasis added).
Isn&#8217;t that incredible? All that adversity was to propel them to their own desired destination. I
can&#8217;t help but wonder if they knew all along what the fierce wind had been for, or who had
caused it. Back in verse 5, we read <i>&#8220;the Lord God caused that there should be a furious wind
blow upon the face of the water towards the promised land.&#8221;</i> Have you ever felt the force of a
&#8220;furious wind&#8221; on your journey? I promise you that you will from time to time. I pray that we
may all remember that <span style="text-decoration: underline">such adversity may be the very force required to impel us to our promised
land.</span></p>
<p>The truth is that in spite of the afflictions which are by definition part of this mortal journey, the
Lord&#8217;s direction and our obedience to it does make the journey easier to bear. Remember Lehi&#8217;s
family in the wilderness before their &#8220;promised land&#8221; arrival. Nephi says that when they needed
to plant seeds, <i>&#8220;we did follow the directions of the ball, which led us in the more fertile parts of
the wilderness&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 16:16). When they needed to hunt for food<i>: &#8220;I did go forth up into the
top of the mountain, according to the directions which were given upon the ball. And&#8230;I did slay
wild beasts, insomuch that I did obtain food for our families&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 17:30-31). The Lord
didn&#8217;t take them out of their wilderness, because the wilderness was part of the plan. But He
blessed them while they were in it as long as they remained faithful and obedient. 
		</p>
<p>Some of our greatest challenges come in dealing with our unfulfilled expectations. Not only do
unexpected things occur in our lives, but often those things we do plan on do not occur in the
time or the way we had hoped. Speaking as one who has not yet married, I know a little about
this. Sometimes when our expectations are frustrated, we are tempted to give up and sit down on
the bench rather than stay in the game and patiently explore an inspired, alternative path. 
		</p>
<p>In speaking of patience, Elder Neal A. Maxwell has spoken of the importance of not just waiting
for promises to be fulfilled, but waiting well. He says, <i>&#8220;Patient endurance&#8230; is more than pacing
up and down within the cell of our circumstance; it is not only acceptance of the things allotted
to us, it is to &#8216;act for ourselves&#8217; by magnifying what is allotted to us&#8221;</i> (&#8220;Endure It Well,&#8221; Ensign,
May 1990, p. 33). I sure hope the Lord never catches me pacing.</p>
<p>Each time I struggle with an unfulfilled expectation, I work my way through the scriptures under
the topic of Patience in the Topical Guide and Index of the standard works. I keep at my bedside
an old spiral notebook with pages of hand-written impressions that have come as I have searched
these scriptures again and again. One of my favorites is found in the first chapter of the Book of
James in the New Testament. This chapter is famous for its fifth verse, which was the catalyst for
Joseph Smith&#8217;s prayer in the Sacred Grove. You know the scripture: <i>&#8220;if any of you lack wisdom,
let him ask of God,&#8221; </i>and so on. The Joseph Smith translation of the three verses that precede it
are, to me, some of the most beautiful doctrine in the scriptures: Starting in verse 2, we read:<i>
&#8220;My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into [many] afflictions; knowing this, that the trying
of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
entire, wanting nothing&#8221;</i> (James 1:2-4).</p>
<p>I know, brothers and sisters, that these words are true. 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">In Alma 9:26, we learn that part of the
Savior&#8217;s glory is his patience.</span> It is indeed a divine virtue and the path of patience leads to a
completion of our spiritual development that we can scarcely fathom. And it brings with it the
fulfillment of every righteous desire that we may be, as James says,<i> &#8220;perfect and entire, wanting
nothing.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I love the invitation of Paul to the Hebrews to be <i>&#8220;followers of them who through faith and
patience inherit the promises&#8221;</i> (Hebrews 6:12). 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">Patience paves our path to the promised land.</span></p>
<p>May I offer one last invitation to you as we consider the journey that lies ahead for each of us?
This comes from the deepest part of my soul, the part that grieves time and again when loved
ones separate themselves from the Church, for whatever reason. I invite you to make a
commitment to yourself and to your Father in Heaven and to your future children today that no
matter what challenges, adversities, temptations or doubts come into your life or into your heart,
you will not walk away from the Church of Jesus Christ. Walking away from the Church of Jesus
Christ is walking away from Jesus Christ. Too many of us convince ourselves that we can remain
close to the Lord without remaining close to His Church and that is a lie.</p>
<p>In our most recent General Conference, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-weight: bold">This Church is the Lord&#8217;s vehicle for crucial doctrines, ordinances,
covenants, and keys that are essential to exaltation, and one cannot be fully
faithful to the gospel of Jesus Christ without striving to be faithful in the
Church, which is its earthly institutional manifestation&#8230;For the fruit of the
gospel to blossom and bless our lives, we must be firmly attached to Him, the
Savior of us all, and to this His Church, which bears His holy name</span> (&#8220;Abide
In Me,&#8221; Ensign, May 2004, p. 32, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Sometimes in life our burdens become great - too heavy, it might seem, to for us to bear. Satan&#8217;s
solution is to convince us that the proverbial straw breaking our back is our activity in the
Church - our callings, our home and visiting teaching assignments, our daily scripture study and
prayer, Family Home Evening, and temple attendance. He whispers so subtly that we would fare
better without such heavy lifting as the gospel of Jesus Christ requires. And Satan&#8217;s doctrine of
deceit is capped by the lie that our covenants are the weightiest thing we carry. He suggests that
we abandon those covenants in order to lighten our pack so we will have the energy to move to
his version of &#8220;higher ground.&#8221; The idea that shedding the protective armor of our covenants will
make life easier to bear is a lie. It is precisely the keeping of our covenants that makes it possible
for us to bear our burdens by binding our hearts to the only One truly capable of bearing them -
our Savior. Without our covenants, we are left to our own strength, just as the Nephites who left
the Church, were defeated in battle and lost their promised land:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And because of this their great wickedness and their boastings in their own
strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they... were afflicted and
smitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost possession of almost
all of their lands</i> (Helaman 4:13).</p>
<p>You will recall the story told in the 24th chapter of Mosiah of the people of Alma who were
slaves to the Lamanites. The scriptures speak of the great persecution that was heaped upon them
and call their afflictions &#8220;great.&#8221; Do you remember what the people of Alma did in the face of
such affliction? They did not forsake their covenants, but <i>&#8220;[cried] mightily to God&#8221; 
		</i>(Mosiah
24:10). And what was the Lord&#8217;s response? He made it possible for Alma&#8217;s people to bear their
burdens. This kind of divine assistance is not available to us when we walk away.</p>
<p>Sometimes the choice to separate oneself from the fold of the Good Shepherd comes in response
to weariness from fighting a persistent temptation or weakness. I think one of Satan&#8217;s favorite
tricks is to stand over us while we are experiencing a temptation and whisper to our hearts that
the temptation is part of our identity, so scripted into our souls that we couldn&#8217;t possibly
overcome it. That is a lie. He makes us feel exhausted as we fight these temptations and tells us
that we would feel so much relief if we&#8217;d just quit fighting. He tells us to be true to ourselves,
which is right, but then tells us the weakness is who we truly are. And that is a lie. 
		<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Our
weaknesses do not define us, they refine us. And they exist to make us humble and to lead
us to Christ.</span> Remember it was the Savior who said, <i>&#8220;I give unto men weakness that they may be
humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me, and have faith
in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them&#8221;</i> (Ether 12:27).</p>
<p>Please resolve to keep your covenants and be active in the Lord&#8217;s Church at all costs. Work out
your challenges within the safety of your covenants. As we read in the Doctrine &amp; Covenants
90:24: <i>&#8220;Search diligently, pray always and be believing and all things shall work together for
your good if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one
with another.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>A counselor in our ward Relief Society recently spoke to our graduating Laurels to welcome
them into the organization. Recognizing that they would be transitioning into various student and
singles wards over the summer, she said so very sincerely, &#8220;wherever you go, please be active.&#8221;
Her words were simple, but I echo them to you today. Wherever you go, please be active.
Immediately attach yourself to your local Church unit. Don&#8217;t wait for them to find you. Ask to be
put to work in the ward. Ask for a home or visiting teaching assignment. Offer to speak in
sacrament meeting or to be on call as a substitute teacher in the Primary.</p>
<p>When you report for duty in the Lord&#8217;s kingdom, you will find your righteous desires being
fulfilled in wonderful, unexpected ways. Sometimes we are afraid to report for duty because
we&#8217;re afraid the Lord will assign us to a part of the vineyard we&#8217;re not interested in or that we&#8217;re
afraid of or we don&#8217;t have time for or that is simply not the area we had planned on. Why do so
many of us assume that the Lord&#8217;s will for us is so different from our own desires? Alma
testified, <i>&#8220;I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire&#8221;</i> (Alma 29:4). This is not
always immediate or literal, but the spirit of it is certainly true. Remember, as father Lehi taught,
we &#8220;are that [we] might have joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it may feel like we are surrendering to the Lord&#8217;s will from this side of the veil, I believe
He is the keeper of <i>our</i> eternal will, the will we had when we could see with an eternal
perspective. We are all here to prove ourselves worthy of a destiny we can no longer fully recall.
But our lack of remembering in no way diminishes the brilliance of that destiny, nor can we let it
diminish our desire to obtain it. Our Father in Heaven remembers what we cannot and His work
and His glory is to help us become not only who He wants us to be but who we pleaded with
Him to help us become. </p>
<p>Remember that your righteous desires are worthy, that if you cultivate them with an eye single to
the glory of God that you will be given opportunities to use your talents and abilities to do so
much good, even in unexpected ways. As you accept adversity and allow patience to have her
perfect work, remaining faithful to Christ and His Church, you will ultimately be &#8220;perfect and
entire, wanting nothing.&#8221;  The Lord says,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you,
if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall
keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye shall
know that it is by me that ye are led</i> (1 Nephi 17:13).</p>
<p>I testify that the grace and power that is available to each of us through the Atonement of Jesus
Christ is sufficient to lead us through this mortal journey to our individual promised land and to
eternal life with our Father in Heaven and our Savior. May you be blessed in your journey, in the
name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>It is a privilege for me to be here on campus today. I have always been impressed with the
graduates of BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho and of the people who live here. I have come to the conclusion that
more people as a percentage of the population serve missions from Rexburg than from any other
city in the Church. I have had the privilege of serving with many of them, some of them who
were leaders of this community and former members of this faculty. I have also had the privilege
of being here on campus when my former missionaries had the opportunity of performing in one
of the great productions of the Performing Arts Department.</p>
<p>It is a privilege to be here with young people that President Hinckley declared to be, 
		<i>&#8220;the finest
generation of young people ever in the history of the Church&#8221;</i> (<i>Teachings of Gordon B.
Hinckley</i>, 1997, 714; see also Conference Report, April 1992, 96 or <i>Ensign</i> May 1992, 69). You
are currently living in one of the most challenging and greatest periods of your life.</p>
<p>You live in a troubled world. Since &#8220;9/11" the world has changed. With terrorism and the
ungodliness that exist in the world, Thomas L. Freidman, political editor for the New York
Times, describes our time by saying,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>My kids aren&#8217;t sure whether North Korea or South Korea is on our side, but they
know the difference between code red and code blue. I grew up terrified of
another super power with a nuclear missile. They grow up terrified of a super
empowered angry person with an automatic weapon. I knew the threat to my life
came from Moscow. They have no idea which student might be carrying a gun or
a knife.</i></p>
<p>He continues by saying,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . About the only thing we know for sure is where the cure has to start. It has to
start in the home, the basic building block for any community or country. Nothing
good will happen in your state house or in your school house if it does not start
and is sustained in your own house</i> (March 30, 2001, New York Times,
&#8220;Longitudes and Attitudes&#8221; by Thomas L. Freidman, 2002 Anchor Books, p. 23-24).</p>
<p>I remember my daughter as she was growing up had a constant feeling in her mind that the
second coming was just around the corner and she would not live to adulthood or have the
privilege of raising children. It was interesting as this feeling of insecurity constantly bothered
her. We were unaware that in Family Night as we spoke of the Second Coming and as she
listened to the daily news about the cold war and the A bomb, she was internalizing this in a way
that she was afraid. She would even go to the extent of saving food and putting it in a drawer.
This was her way of implementing the food storage program. It was not uncommon for her
mother while cleaning her room to find a chicken leg or wing stuffed in one of the dresser
drawers.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t fully understand until I began to relate it to my own life. I was born just prior to World
War II. I remember wondering during the war years what the world would be like in the future.
The Korean War and then the Vietnam conflict came along and feelings of instability and
uncertainty existed. I remember listening to the gospel teachings and knowing that we are living
in the last days. The questions would come; how far do I plan ahead? What do I do? I found that
I didn&#8217;t feel those feelings alone. I have talked to college professors and business professionals
who have indicated that while growing up they too wondered what was in the future and had a
feeling that the second coming was just around the corner.</p>
<p>As we look back in history, we find that throughout all ages there have been troubled and
disturbing times and unsettling times in the minds of people and saints. It required faith to live.
During the time of the Savior the Jewish world was in captivity by the Roman Empire. Can you
imagine the concern that was in their minds for what the future should bear? The Jewish people
had already been through captivity in Babylon and experienced great hardships.</p>
<p>Aware of the concerns that exist in the minds of our young people, President Packer, in his talk
entitled, &#8220;Do Not Fear,&#8221; said this as he contemplated the future of his grandson:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>What kind of a world awaits him?</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For a moment I had that feeling of anxiety, that fear of the future that so many
parents express to us. Everywhere we go fathers and mothers worry about the
future of their children in this very troubled world.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But then a feeling of assurance came over me. He said, &#8216;My fear of the future
faded.&#8217;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>That guiding, comforting Spirit, with which we in the Church are so familiar,
brought to my remembrance what I already knew. The fear of the future was
gone. That bright-eyed, little two-year-old can have a good life - a very good life -
and so can his children and his grandchildren, even though they will live in a
world where there is much of wickedness. [May I add so can you!]</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>They will see many events transpire in the course of their lifetime. Some of these
shall tax their courage and extend their faith. But if they seek prayerfully for help
and guidance, they shall be given power over adverse things. Such trials shall not
be permitted to stand in the way of their progress, but instead shall act as
stepping-stones to greater knowledge</i> (Boyd K. Packer, &#8220;Do Not Fear,&#8221; 
		<i>Ensign</i>,
May 2004, 77).</p>
<p>In a priesthood session Elder Maxwell said,<i> &#8220;My brethren old and young, sweeping is the only
way to describe your spiritual history and your possible future. There will always be plenty of
work to do, especially for those who know how to do the Lord&#8217;s work&#8221;</i> (Neal A. Maxwell,
		<i>Ensign</i>, May 1998, 37).</p>
<p>I find this counsel comforting. Yes, we know the Savior will again come to this earth and we
know that the conditions of the world will be difficult. The key is to live &#8220;worthy&#8221; lives, to make
right choices so that we can be part of the great work that lies ahead. As President Hinckley
pointed out, <i>&#8220;With all of the problems of today&#8217;s world with the difficulties, challenges and
transgressions that are occurring we as Latter-day Saints still have the greatest group of young
men and young women anywhere on the face of the earth&#8221;</i> (<i>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</i>
[1997], 714).</p>
<p>In a recent meeting the President expressed concerns about the challenges of today and then
asked the question, &#8220;Are we spiritually converted?&#8221; Referring to the strength and commitment to
the gospel of Jesus Christ, are we as converted as those of the early Church, those who crossed
the plains and established the kingdom? These are questions that cause all to ponder. Are we,
and more importantly are those we are teaching, developing a deep spiritual conversion? The fire
of conversion Paul referred to, <i>&#8220;the fire that shall try every man&#8217;s work of what sort it is&#8221;</i> (I
Corinthians 3:13). The fire that will yet save us.</p>
<p>Joseph Fielding Smith said,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Men and women who become settled in the truth founded in the knowledge of the
gospel depend upon no person for borrowed or reflected light, but trusting only
upon the holy spirit who is ever the same, shining forever and testifying to the
individual and the priesthood who live in harmony with the laws of the gospel of
the glory and will of the Father. They will then have light everlasting which
cannot be obscured, but is shining in their lives they shall cause others to glorify
God and by their well doing put to silence the ignorance of foolish men and show
forth praises for him who hath called them out of darkness into his marvelous
light</i> (Joseph Fielding Smith, <i>Gospel Doctrine</i>, 87-88).</p>
<p>This is the type of deep gospel testimony and understanding we must develop and teach for the
time cometh that no one can stand on borrowed light. We must teach and learn to understand the
scriptures, to get beyond the commentaries of those who are not certain. We must prepare
ourselves to be so rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ that as we bear testimony and share the
sacred truths, the gospel teachings live for us, and we have a desire and thirst after knowledge
and righteousness. We cannot live on what was accomplished in the past.</p>
<p>Our challenge is with every new generation. Righteousness and knowledge are not passed on in
the genes. Every generation must acquire it. As individuals we must, as the Lord said, &#8220;Work out
our own salvation with diligence.&#8221; We must recognize that,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Never before, at least not in our generation, have the forces of evil been so
blatant, so brazen, so aggressive as they are today. Those things we dared not
speak about in earlier times are now constantly projected (or enter into our living
rooms) affecting the families. Men to whom we have looked to as leaders have
betrayed us. We are disappointed and disillusioned and their activity is only the
tip of the iceberg in successive layers beneath the tip is the great mass of sleaze
and filth of dissolute and dishonest behavior,</i> said Elder Maxwell (Neal A.
Maxwell, <i>Love and Loyalty</i>, 5).</p>
<p>Leaders and especially teachers in the Church today must be better qualified and prepared with
problems they face. Mothers and Fathers, in order to preserve the home, require support. The
Church leaders and auxiliaries together with Church Education System are the only source of
spiritual strength and support to which they can turn for help in a very troubled world.</p>
<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson, reputedly the wisest American, said, &#8220;Character is higher than intellect.
A great soul will benefit to live, as well as to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Developing character is the process of acquiring Christlike attributes such as
		<i>&#8220;. . . faith, virtue,
knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindliness, godliness, humility, diligence, . . . charity
and love with an eye singled to the glory of God . . .&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 4:5-6).</p>
<p>You are at the very point in your lives where you are faced with the major decisions that will
affect now and all eternity. You have been well prepared as students through your earlier
schooling, seminary and institute. In these next few years you will be deciding on the course of
your majors and minors in school, whether to go on missions, marriage, future employment
opportunities. These are key and pivotal decisions in your life. It causes me to reflect on the
problems that I faced growing up trying to make decisions, counseling with my mother, not sure
sometimes exactly what I wanted to do and she would always say, &#8220;You have your own agency.
You do what you think is best.&#8221; Then as she would turn to walk away she would quote, 
		<i>&#8220;Choose
you this day whom ye will serve. . . as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord&#8221;</i> (Joshua
24:15).</p>
<p>This always left me with that subtle reminder that yes, I have agency, but I had better make the
right decision. You live in a glorious generation. A generation with more opportunity than any
other who proceeded you. Elder Maxwell said,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>More than any proceeding generation in the Church, yours is destined to serve in
a period of human history which will feature things both grim and glorious.
Indeed your season can be characterized by Charles Dickens words, &#8216;These were
the best of times and the worst of times.&#8217; The days we live in are challenging</i>
(Charles Dickens, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, Sheldon Company,1863,7.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Neal A. Maxwell, &#8220;These Are Your Days&#8221; Church Education Fireside, p.2).</p>
<p>You are at a most interesting time of your lives, making decisions that will shape the future.
Richard L. Evans said,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Life offers you two precious gifts. One in time and the other in freedom of choice.
The freedom to buy with your time what you will. You are free to change your
allotment of time for thrills. You may trade it for base desires. You may invest it in
greed. You may purchase with it vanity. You may spend your time in pursuit of
material things. Yours is the freedom to choose, but these are not bargains for in
them you will find no lasting satisfaction</i> (Film, &#8220;Man&#8217;s Search for Happiness&#8221;).</p>
<p>A couple of years ago while I was home from my assignment in the Pacific for General
Conference, a knock came at my door. When I opened the door there stood a man, who was
advanced in years with gray hair and gray beard. He looked at me for a moment and said, &#8220;You
don&#8217;t recognize me, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I struggled and still could not recognize the individual. He then shared his name with me. Upon
hearing the name I then recognized that he was a boyhood friend. I was excited and invited him
in. We chatted for sometime about our past experiences together. Then he said something that I
felt was very profound, &#8220;The difference in our lives is in the decisions that we have made.&#8221; Then
he proceeded to tell me of some of the struggles and challenges he had in his life and some of the
decisions that he made that led him in a path contrary to the will of our Father in Heaven. He
then shared with me the price that he had paid for those decisions.</p>
<p>I felt a deep friendship and love for him, but also a sorrow for what he had been through. I have
often pondered upon the statement that he made and realized that we are in fact the result of the
sum total of the decisions we make in life.</p>
<p>As I pondered this thought the words of a hymn came to mind:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Know this that every soul is free</i></p>

<p>President Hunter in speaking to a group of young people like this said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I would like to say something to you that I consider to be very important.
Throughout your life you will be faced with many choices. How well you select
among the alternatives will determine your success and happiness in life. Some of
the decisions you will make will be absolutely critical and can affect the entire
course of your life. Please measure those alternatives against the teachings of
Jesus Christ. To be able to do that, you must know and understand his teachings
as you exercise faith and live worthy of inspiration you will be directed in the
important choices you make. The very wise know and obey the will of our Father
in Heaven. I suggest that you place the highest priority on your membership in
the Church of Jesus Christ. Measure whatever anyone else asks you to do whether
it be from your family, loved ones, your cultural heritage, or traditions you have
inherited, measure everything against the teachings of the Savior. When you find
variance from those teachings, set that matter aside and do not pursue it. It will
not bring you happiness . . . live the restored truth with honesty and integrity . . .
then the Lord can cause his miracles to occur</i> (Counsel to Students and Faculty,
Church College of New Zealand, Howard W. Hunter 12 Nov. 1990, 1,4).</p>
<p>This is the time of life when parents continue to worry about you. Not because they don&#8217;t trust
you, they do, but they recognize the importance of each of the decisions you make. Let me share

It takes the butterfly nearly 12 hours of hard work and pain before it can emerge
from the cocoon and take wings and fly. If anyone were to do it for him he would
die because it is through the strength he gains in his struggle that he can take
wings and fly and find food to live. As you are about to emerge from your cocoon
we hope your trials will be small ones and you will take wings and soar with
eagles.</i></p>

<p>The story of Laman and Lemuel in the Book of Mormon has always been an interesting story for
me because I realize that they saw an angel, heard the voice of the Lord, saw miracles, saw the
Liahona and were brought to the promised land, but what did they do? Why do you suppose they
did what they did? Are there people like them today? They loved evil more than good and
enjoyed the pleasure of the flesh. Why? Because of the hardness of their hearts.</p>

learning to live the &#8220;law of the celestial kingdom&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenants 78:7).</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold">III.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Choose to build a testimony on eternal truths.</span></p>
<p>I was once chairman of the State Judicial Selection Committee. It was an interesting experience
for me because I got acquainted with many of the leading attorneys and judges and chief justices
in the Supreme Court in the State of Utah. As we went through the selection process I learned
much about how decisions are made from the bench and to some degree I lost faith in the court
system. I had always held out in my mind that through the court system you would find out right
from wrong, or truth. Yet, that is not how the system works. Their desire is to find justice. That
sometimes is not black or white, right or wrong, it is a middle ground that seems to solve
problems rather than truth or exacts. We must realize that there are things that never change.
There are eternal truths, those principles that we can depend on. They are the foundation stone of
our testimony.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us two scriptures that help us to know and understand. The first is in the
Doctrine and Covenants, section nine, where the Lord chastised Oliver for not doing what he
should have done. He should have reasoned it out in his own mind. When you are working here
at school, when you deal with problems of life, give it your best intellectual effort. Ask the
question, when you are confronted with temptations or trials or doctrinal issues, does it make
common sense? Has it withstood the test of time? Remember to reason it out in your own mind.
Then ask God.</p>
<p>There is another way by which you can build testimony. It is found in Moroni 10:4,5:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And when ye shall receive these things I would exhort you that ye would ask God
the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye
shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will
manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.</i></p>
<p>The final vindication for absolutes is one that comes through the eternal principle of revelation.
Live worthy to receive it.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold">IV.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Choose to make a difference in a changing world.</span></p>
<p>Do you think you can change what is happening in the world, or the Church, or your lives? I
believe that you can because I know how the Lord changes the course of history. He sends
babies into the world. The statement that you were held back to come forth at this time and in
this dispensation has great meaning when you understand the plan of the Lord. Many of you may
be asking the question, &#8220;If I can&#8217;t change myself, how can I make a difference, or change the
world?&#8221;</p>
<p>I know that there are doomsayers that say, &#8220;Well that&#8217;s just the way I am, you can&#8217;t change!&#8221;</p>
<p>My answer to them is they do not understand or do not believe the doctrines of the gospel, for
the doctrine of repentance brings about change. When you choose to follow Christ, you choose
to be changed. As President David O. McKay said, <i>&#8220;No man can sincerely resolve to imply in
his daily life the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth without sensing a change in his own nature&#8221;</i>
(<i>David O. McKay, President of the Church</i>, 1961, 253-254).</p>
<p>I have watched with interest over the last several years what appears to me to be a growing
dearth and lack of leaders and leadership and a growing lack of interest in preserving the rights
and freedoms we hold dear. I only need to point to the recent primary election where so few went
to the polls to cast their ballots to make my case.</p>
<p>We need young men and young women of integrity, high moral principle, conviction and vision
to stand forth and to lead and to assume responsibilities - not only in the Church, but in
government for <i>&#8220;Where there is no vision, the people perish . . .&#8221;</i> (Proverbs 29:18) 
		</p>
<p>Do not back away from the responsibilities that lie ahead. Do not put pleasure and self-gratification before duty. Seek to do the will of the Lord. Make a difference.</p>

		</span></p>
<p>Keep yourself worthy. Never, never, compromise the standards of the Church. Never succumb to
the enticements of the world. We live in a world with many temptations and the adversary holds
it out like he did to Adam and Eve. He tempts you with all the lures of the world. There are
people in high positions in the world today that are not living as they should. How will they be
judged? By their fellow man or by God? Yes, I think we all know ultimately by God. We cannot
hide or deceive an all-knowing and just God.</p>
<p>You have a challenge to fulfill your god-given birthright or your foreordination, but you can&#8217;t do
it by indecision. Elijah thundered, <i>&#8220;How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God,
follow Him&#8221; </i>(I Kings 18:21).</p>
<p>To do nothing or procrastinate in making a decision, is a decision. Many times when we fail to
act we find ourselves going along with a crowd and succumbing to the world around us. Be
strong, resist.</p>
<p>Making good decisions depends a lot on what we think and how we feel inside. Are we truly
converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ? Do we truly want to do good or is the lure of the world
or the excuses given by many in the world just too strong to resist? You must face it, as my
mother reminded me, &#8220;Choose ye this day whom ye will serve . . . as for me and my house we
will serve the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prepare so you can raise your children in a complex and changing world. The job market is
changing and the demand for more skill and a higher level of specialty is ever increasing. In
order to stay up with the technological explosion and the shifting economic conditions in the job
market, it is thus essential that you take seriously the opportunity you have and that you are not
just occupying a seat in order to obtain a degree, but that you truly retain the knowledge and
information that can be applied and added to. The one thing that attending the university should
teach you is that learning does not cease on graduation day.</p>
<p>Now, in conclusion, these are days never to be forgotten. You will in the future look back on
them with feelings of satisfaction and reassurance if you are obedient to the counsel of the Lord.
Life will not always be easy. It was not meant to be. How else would we learn if we didn&#8217;t meet
opposition? The Lord has promised that at this important time of your life, <i>&#8220;if ye are prepared,
ye need not fear&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 38:30).</p>
<p>The basketball coach at Kent State, Brother Tony Ingle, one who has met a lot of difficulties and
challenges in his life, said, <i>&#8220;Life is short, serious and frail. Learn from it, laugh at it and live it
well&#8221;</i> (Church News, April 3, 2004, p.14).</p>
<p>President Hinckley has counseled us by saying,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>There is still so much of conflict in the world. There is terrible poverty disease
and hatred. Man is still brutal in his inhumanity to man. Yet there is a glorious
dawn. The Son of righteousness has come with healing in his wings. God and his
beloved son have revealed themselves. We know them. We worship them in spirit
and in truth. We love them, we honor them and we seek to do their will . . . there
is in other words much reason for cheer and there is every reason to have faith
that the forces of righteousness will prevail over evil even in this perilous time</i>
(Church News, April 10, 2004, p.24).</p>
<p>Stay close to your Heavenly Father through prayer. Seek divine guidance. You will face
challenges and you will see your children face challenges that you didn&#8217;t know existed. The
difficulties, the trials, the struggles will continue to get worse, but you have been given the
power to help, to bless. You can overcome!</p>
<p>Remember that a crown of eternal glory in the kingdom of our Father and all that the Father has
promised is yours as you remain true and faithful to the doctrines of the kingdom. You can be
blessed with wonderful homes and wonder marriages, but only by keeping the commandments
and making right choices.</p>
<p>May you be so blessed is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>It is a humbling opportunity and experience to stand before you this afternoon. I sense the
tremendous responsibility of sharing a gospel message that will both edify and lift. I invite the
Holy Ghost to unitedly touch our hearts and minds as we review the basic and first principle of
the gospel. I also invite you to have handy pencil and paper to take notes and record your
impressions that will come to your mind during our time together.</p>
<p>Today I would like to share my thoughts and impressions about the principle of faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ. Two scripture references serve as the basis for my message.</p>
<p>The first reference is found in Luke 17 (p. 1308) and the second in Mark 9 (p. 1257). In Luke 17,
and the preceding chapters the Savior had been teaching his disciples by precept and parable. He
spoke of specific character traits - seeds of faith if you will, that are necessary in the
development of true followers and candidates of the Kingdom of God. And as the apostles
listened they recognized their personal weaknesses &#8211; their lack of faith and responded to the
Savior in verse 5: <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>&#8220;&#8230;Lord, increase our faith.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p>In the 9<sup>th</sup> chapter of Mark (p. 1257) a father struggling to care for his son who was possessed
with a &#8220;dumb spirit,&#8221; requested that the Savior heal the child. In verse 23 we read the promise
given to all. Said the Savior: <i>&#8220;If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.&#8221;</i>
To which the father responded in verse 24<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>&#8220;&#8230;Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief&#8221;</i></span>
(emphasis added).</p>
<p>These two phrases <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>&#8220;&#8230;Lord, increase our faith&#8221;</i></span> and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>&#8220;&#8230;Lord, I believe; help thou mine
unbelief&#8221;</i></span> are most appropriate for each of us as we gain experience in this laboratory of applied
faith that is called mortality. Indeed, may our prayer be 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;<i>Lord, increase my faith and help thou
mine unbelief.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p>So much depends upon our individual faith as the apostle Paul counseled 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>&#8220;&#8230;that, whilst &#8230;in
the body, we are absent from the Lord&#8230; [and]&#8230;we walk by faith, not sight&#8221;</i></span> (2 Corinthians
5:6-7, emphasis added). In fact our mortal life is so designed that we are to <i>&#8220;overcome by faith&#8221;</i>
(Doctrine and Covenants 76:53) all things. Adversity and opposition can increase our faith or
instead can cause the troubling roots of bitterness to spring up. In those times of testing and
trying, when we feel weak and our faith diminishing our prayer should be &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>Lord, increase my
faith and help thou mine unbelief.</i></span>&#8221; A personal experience of testing my faith in a gospel
principle illustrates.</p>
<p>On January 19, 1970 I found myself standing on a door step in Fayetteville Arkansas waiting
with my missionary companion for a response to our knock. I had been in the mission field
exactly three days and was learning the art of tracting and door approaches. Of course I was
nervous and afraid of the unknown behind the door. On the first door I had knocked on the day
before, a Methodist minister answered and invited us to a &#8220;healthy&#8221; three hour discussion of the
Bible with he and two other ministers. Today I hoped that things would be different.</p>
<p>As the door opened I started with our greeting and approach explaining that we had come with a
message from a prophet of God about the Savior Jesus Christ. The man at the door asked what
church we belonged to.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or the Mormons&#8221; I replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, your prophet or whatever you call him died yesterday, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221; stated the man in the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I replied &#8220;Our prophet is David O. McKay and lives in Salt Lake City, Utah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s him. He died yesterday,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I just heard it on the news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of you might understand how I felt at that moment. I was nineteen, had been to one
semester at Ricks College, received a mission call, spent five days in the mission home (MTC),
and then sent to my mission area of Tulsa Oklahoma. I had been raised in a community where
the LDS Church was in a minority but in a home where the seeds of a testimony of the restored
gospel built upon prophets and apostles had been planted in my soul. My testimony of those
principles at that time was small, having been tested only by my high school classmates. Now
here I was in a strange place (Arkansas), among people that I didn&#8217;t know, without the comfort
of my home, my parents and familiar ward members and told that the person I believed to be the
prophet was gone.</p>
<p>I was devastated. I had put all of my trust and testimony at that time in the only prophet that I
had known, President David O. McKay. Indeed at his passing two out of every three members of
the Church had known no prophet other than President McKay who served from 1951 to 1970.
He was known for his expansion of the Church's worldwide mission. He was well known for his
quotes &#8220;Every member a missionary&#8221; and &#8220;No success can compensate for failure in the home.&#8221;
Under his administration, the first stakes were created outside of the United States. He also
strengthened Church membership with a renewed emphasis on the value of family life and
education.</p>
<p>The test: Did I have the faith to accept a new president of the Church as the prophet? That day I
wrote in my journal <span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;His passing will be a great test (of faith) upon a lot of the people.&#8221;</span> In
the days that followed I felt much like the man who brought his afflicted son to the Savior to be
healed who <i>&#8220;&#8230;cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Have you ever had such an experience where your faith was tested? Perhaps your faith has been
tried by different circumstances such as the unexpected passing of a loved one, or a deep
disappointment with a spouse or friend or a relationship that didn&#8217;t go as you had planned. Or
perhaps the grade of an exam or a paper that you had worked so hard on didn&#8217;t meet your
expectations. Perhaps you or someone you know suffers from an unrelieved illness or infirmity,
		<i>&#8220;&#8230;a thorn in the flesh&#8230;to buffet&#8230;&#8221;</i> you (2 Corinthians 12:7).</p>
<p>In 1970 and at other times when my faith is tested and I feel weak I have prayed &#8220;&#8230;Lord,
increase my faith, I believe, help thou my unbelief.&#8221; To supplement that prayer I have found six
fundamental factors that will assist in increasing our faith and diminish our unbelief. My
message is for those whose faith may waiver without cause. For those who experience tests and
trials that seem to be more than they can bear. And it is for those who are well founded and
settled in their faith.</p>
<p>To begin with let&#8217;s first define what faith is and then add the fundamentals of increasing our
faith.</p>
<p>What is faith? Suppose the person sitting next to you had asked you that question? How would
you answer them? More than likely you would quote the scripture from Hebrews, chapter 11 or
Alma 32: <i>&#8220;Now faith is the substance [assurance] of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
seen&#8221;</i> (Hebrews 11:1).</p>
<p>Had you given this answer to the question &#8220;What is faith?&#8221; you would have received full credit
on a multiple-choice test question &#8211; a good &#8220;pat answer&#8221; but does the meaning of that scripture
definition settle deep in your being?</p>
<p>Joseph Smith wrote in <i>Lectures On Faith</i>, <i>&#8220;From this (Hebrews 11:1) we learn that faith is the
assurance which men have of the existence of things which they have not seen, and the principle
of action in all intelligent beings&#8221;</i> (<i>Lectures on Faith</i> 1:9).</p>
<p>Please pay close attention to the last part of that quote. <i>&#8220;&#8230;we learn that faith is&#8230;<span style="font-weight: bold">the principle
of action </span>in all intelligent beings.&#8221;</i> Faith is more than just believing. Sometimes faith and belief
are used interchangeably in describing ones conviction or assurance of a principle. There is a
difference between the two though. One cannot have faith without belief as Elder James Talmage
explains</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Belief</span> is in a sense passive, an agreement or acceptance only; 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">faith</span> is active and
positive, embracing such reliance only and confidence as will lead to works&#8230;.
One cannot have faith without belief; yet he may believe and still lack faith. Faith
is vivified, vitalized, living belief</i> (<i>The Articles of Faith</i>, Talmage, p. 96, emphasis
added).</p>
<p>Belief then is the first fundamental to faith and increasing our faith. Many may think that they
have faith simply because they believe. Having a belief in something requires no action - only a
passive state of agreement or acceptance. As a young child the seeds of faith are first planted in
our soul through observing our parents and church leaders and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>believing</i></span> that what they did was
right. Our observations did not require action but only a simple passive agreement or acceptance.</p>
<p>The children of Israel may serve as an example of how belief is turned to faith. As Moses led the
children of Israel from captivity in Egypt they demonstrated a belief in the Lord. Let&#8217;s pick up
the story in Exodus 14 (p. 100). You will remember the struggle that the children of Israel had in
gaining their freedom from Pharaoh. In reality they engaged in little acts of faith in gaining their
freedom. Their actions were more passive, agreeing with what Moses and the Lord was doing for
them. They merely believed and followed. But their belief and small seeds of faith were soon
tested. As the camp of Israel arrived at the Red Sea to their horror they saw the army of Pharaoh
in hot pursuit. Note in verses 11-12 their reaction to the tribulation or adversity they faced: 
		<i>&#8220;And
they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in
the wilderness?...Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians&#8230;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>At the first sign of trouble and a trial of their belief the faith of the children of Israel fainted and
they were ready to give up. However the Lord had a great work for His children. He knew that
they were weak in faith and had only a belief in Him through His prophet Moses as illustrated in
verse 13: <i>&#8220;And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">stand still, and see </span>the salvation of the
Lord, which he will shew to you to day:&#8230;&#8221;</i> (Exodus 14:11-13 emphasis added)</p>
<p>With that the Lord, through his prophet, parted the Red Sea and the children of Israel passed
upon dry ground through the sea to safety. Like the children of Israel you and I have stood still in
your youth and watched the workings of the Lord through your parents and Church leaders.</p>
<p>As a young boy of about eleven years old my father came home from his job one day and
reported that the company he had been working for over the past 13 years was about to close
down. He would have to find new employment. There were some concerns and challenges which
tested our family&#8217;s belief and faith. Because of his early induction into the army and World War
II my father neither had not completed high school nor had he worked for any other company
leaving his resume wanting. I remember my father calling our family together to discuss our
situation and then leading us in fasting and prayer. It can be said that my brothers and sisters and
I did not exercise faith at that time, but we acted in agreement and acceptance of what my
parents were telling us and what they were doing. Within a day of our family fast and prayer a
new and better position was offered to my father and my belief increased to a faith in the
principles of fasting and prayer.</p>
<p>The seeds of faith in gospel principles are planted through the foundation of believing. But there
is more&#8230; Faith to be faith requires action. Action requires that each individual posses agency,
the ability to act for themselves. Without agency there can be no action. Without action there can
be no faith. During their captivity in Egypt the children of Israel did not have their agency. They
were told what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. Without agency they could develop little
faith. It was this understanding that led the Saviors&#8217; brother James to write:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone&#8230;.Thou believest that
there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt
thou know, O vain man that faith without works is dead?&#8221;</i> (James 2:17-20)</p>
<p>So from the definition of faith we can see that to have faith we must follow a course of action. Of
course our actions must be righteous and in compliance with the will of God and Jesus Christ. In
some circumstances we are overcome by preoccupying cares of the world that we forget the
purpose for which we act. This leads us to the second fundamental to increasing our faith and
helping our unbelief.</p>
<p>The beginnings of faith require a <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>desire</i></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>to believe</i></span>. Consider for a minute how you have felt
when you heard an inspiring thought, hymn, or story? Did you have desire to go and do
something good? Those feelings are not unusual and are spiritually founded - essential to our
faith and eternal progress. As Alma taught the Zoramnites in chapter 32 the Lord will bless you<i>
&#8220;&#8230;even if you can no more than desire to believe&#8230;&#8221;</i> (Alma 32:27) From these beginnings
comes the &#8220;exercising of a particle of faith.&#8221; This desire will grow into a mature faith that can
make things happen in your life. Elder Neil A. Maxwell taught:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Desire denotes a real longing or craving. Hence righteous desires are much more
than passive preferences or fleeting feelings&#8230;. what we insistently desire, over
time, is what we will eventually become and what we will receive in eternity</i>
(&#8220;According to the Desire of [Our] Hearts,&#8221; <i>Ensign,</i> Nov. 1996, 21 ).</p>
<p>If our desire is &#8220;&#8230;Lord, increase my faith and help thou mine unbelief&#8221; we must have the desire
to do so &#8230;<i>&#8220;For I [said the Lord] will judge all men according to their works, according to the
desire of their hearts&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 137:9; see also Jer. 17:10).</p>
<p>It is so important that we check and control our desires, the things for which we long or crave.
What we desire will ultimately determine our eternal judgment as Alma taught; God<i> &#8220;granteth
unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life&#8221;</i> (Alma 29:4). Those
things that seem all-important to you now may not matter in years to come. You can choose now
to want things that are in harmony with eternity or not. Elder Marion D. Hanks is quoted as
saying: <i>&#8220;The things that matter most must not be at the mercy of the things that matter least,&#8221;</i></p>
<p>To which I would add a quote I heard years ago: &#8220;The chief cause of failure and unhappiness is
trading what we want most for what we want at the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third fundamental in increasing our faith and helping our unbelief is 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>study</i></span>. With respect to
increasing our faith and helping our unbelief the Lord told Joseph Smith and the Church: 
		<i>&#8220;And
as all have <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out
of the best books words of wisdom; </i><span style="font-weight: bold">seek learning, even by study</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">and also by faith</span><i>&#8221;</i> (Doctrine
and Covenants 88:118, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Remember our definition of faith? &#8220;Faith is&#8230;the principle of action in all intelligent beings&#8230;&#8221;
In this scripture notice the action required, &#8220;&#8230;seek learning, even by study, and also by faith.&#8221;
As a teacher I am approached by students that are uncertain of an upcoming test. The common
indicators of their uncertainty or lack of faith is expressed in the phrases: &#8220;What should I study
to prepare for the exam?&#8221; or during a lecture a student has been known to raise his/her hand and
ask &#8220;Will this be on the test?&#8221; Other students that I am familiar with will fret and worry about an
upcoming exam so that they cannot focus on their studies. They jump from one page of text or
notes to another, trying to determine what is important and what is not. To these students I
suggest the previous verse &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold">And as all have not faith&#8230;seek learning, even by study and also
by faith.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Elder Maxwell adds:<i> &#8220;Failure to study, &#8230; is to be intellectually and spiritually malnourished.&#8221;</i>
The words of the Savior and the prophets and apostles do matter in increasing our faith. The
prophet Joseph Smith taught: <i>&#8220;&#8230;we understand that when a man works by faith he works by
mental exertion instead of physical force. It is by words&#8230;with which every being works when he
works by faith&#8221; </i>(Lectures on Faith 7:3).</p>
<p>To be able to increase our faith we must obtain the words of God through study of the scriptures,
and the writings of the prophets and apostles. Joseph Smith said: <i>&#8220;Faith comes by hearing the
word of God, through the testimony of the servants of God. &#8230;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Combined with study is the fourth fundamental &#8211; 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>prayer.</i></span></p>
<p>Deep, sincere personal prayer is essential to our faith and will increase our faith and help us
overcome the adversity that threatens our faith. Prayer is action and therefore is the
implementation of faith. A familiar example of one who exercised his faith through prayer is the
Prophet Joseph Smith. When he was 14 years old he was active in applying the fundamentals of
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>believing, desiring, and</i></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>study</i></span> in attempting to increase his faith and overcome his unbelief. As
he read from the book of James, chapter 1, verses five and six, a determination to pray came
upon him. The same applies to us as we plead, &#8220;&#8230;Lord, increase my faith and help thou my
unbelief.&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of
the sea driven with the wind and tossed</i> (James 1:5-6).</p>
<p>As young Joseph read that scripture the elements of faith started to emerge through his actions.
He <span style="font-weight: bold">believed</span>; he had a 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">desire</span> to know the truth; he 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">studied</span> and then made a determination to
		<span style="font-weight: bold">pray</span>. Acting as an intelligent being Joseph exercised his faith and entered the grove of trees near
his home on a spring day in 1820. As a result of his actions his faith was increased, and his
unbelief became a sure knowledge. I testify that in that grove of trees that day Joseph Smith did
learn the true nature of God the Father and His only begotten son, Jesus Christ. Indeed, he did
see God the Father and Jesus Christ and testified that they both live! I testify that through the
faith of Joseph Smith that the faith and unbelief of all individuals, including you and I can be
increased and changed to full faith because of that experience. Think how different our lives
would be if Joseph Smith had not exercised such strong faith.</p>
<p>To be effective our prayers must be sincere, consistent and selfless. The commandment is given
to &#8220;exercise your faith,&#8230;that ye begin to call upon his holy name&#8230;and pray always&#8230;unto the
Father in my name&#8221; (Alma 34:23, 3 Nephi 18:15, 19). What are your prayers like? How often do
you pray? Do you have your sacred place in your apartment that you can go to in prayer? While
serving as a campus Bishop I would ask those questions to the student members of my ward.
Often I would get the answer &#8220;I usually say my prayers before I go to bed at night. But in the
morning there isn&#8217;t enough time.&#8221; To which I respond: &#8220;When do you think you need protection
and your faith increased more? During the daytime when you are awake and exposed to the
world or at night while you are asleep?&#8221; The correct answer is to pray always&#8230;morning, night,
during the day&#8230;always. Check your own status of prayer as we look at this next quote from
President Howard W. Hunter:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If prayer is only a spasmodic cry at the time of crisis, then it is utterly selfish, and
we come to think of God as a repairman or a service agency to help us only in our
emergencies. We should remember the Most High day and night &#8211; always &#8211; not
only at times when all other assistance has failed and we desperately need help. If
there is any element in human life on which we have a record or miraculous
success and inestimable worth to the human soul, it is prayerful, reverential,
devout communication with our Heavenly Father </i>(<i>Hallowed Be Thy Name</i>,
President Howard W. Hunter, October 1977 Conference).</p>
<p>The fifth fundamental to increasing one&#8217;s faith and helping our unbelief is 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>service</i></span>. Faith and
service go hand in hand. Most here today can quote Mosiah 2:17, <i>&#8220;&#8230;I tell you these things that
ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye
are only in the service of your God&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 2:17). Service implies action. Action is the
principle of our faith and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the priesthood&#8217;s dynamic power
source. Without faith service to our fellow beings is not service to God. In our day and age
service can be made easier through some of the modern conveniences made available through
technology and electronic gadgets. However, these modern wonders can also play a role in
reducing our individual faith. For example it is easy for me to type an email to family, friends or
members of my stake or ward. That email can serve as a form of communication with those
individuals. Once the &#8220;send&#8221; button is hit and the email is gone it may become easy to end my
service there. I might rationalize &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ve done my duty and it&#8217;s up to the other person to
carry on.&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m glad that I didn&#8217;t have to face that person and ask them to forgive me for being
such a jerk &#8211; my email is great.&#8221; Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, former apostles Peter and Paul
and other great people performed significant service without using emails, fax machines, or
computers. Their power of service depended upon faith. Let us <i>&#8220;remember that without faith,
you can do nothing,&#8230;&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 8:10) As we provide righteous service our faith
will increase. As the Lord commanded His apostles <i>&#8220;He that believeth on me, the works that I
shall do he do also; and greater works than these shall he do&#8221;</i> (John 14:11-12). With faith we
can do all things<i> &#8220;according to your faith&#8230;&#8221;</i> (Matthew 9:29)</p>
<p>You remember the story of Nephi and his brothers providing service in returning to Jerusalem to
obtain the brass plates. At first they tried different ways to obtain the plates including charm,
persuasion, wisdom, wealth. They failed. After their failure Nephi turned to faith. 
		<i>&#8220;I was led by
the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do&#8221; </i>Nephi later records (1 Nephi
4:6). He moved with faith, &#8220;the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.&#8221;
Can we do the same? Do you walk by faith, putting your trust in the Savior of the unseen things?
In the case of Nephi faith came first and then action. The rest of the story you already know.
Listen to what President Ezra Taft Benson says about the need of faith in our service:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;Faith in Him (Jesus Christ) is more than mere acknowledgment that He lives. It
is more than professing belief. Faith in Jesus Christ consists of complete reliance
on Him. As God, He has infinite power, intelligence, and love. 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">There is no
human problem</span> beyond His capacity to solve&#8230;. He knows how to help us rise
above our daily difficulties. Faith in Him means believing that even though we do
not understand all things, He does&#8221;</i> (<i>Sermons and Writings of President Ezra Taft
Benson</i>, p. 7, emphasis added).</p>
<p>The sixth fundamental of increasing our faith and helping our unbelief is 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>worship</i></span>. Worship is
more than service. A lack of deep genuine worship erodes our faith. To worship is to give God
our love, reverence, devotion and service. In this dispensation the Lord has commanded</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Thou shalt <span style="font-weight: bold">love</span> the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and
in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5).</p>
<p>Our faith is weakened when we put other people or anything above the love of God. To do so is
the practice of false worship. If the affections of our heart and our thoughts are directed toward
God then our faith will be increased and our unbelief will diminish. Brigham Young was a man
of great vision and faith. His faith in a living God and every principle and doctrine of the gospel
was demonstrated in the way he lived and taught. He said the following with respect to faith and
worship:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If the Latter-day Saints will walk up to their privileges, and exercise faith in the
name of Jesus Christ, and live in the enjoyment of the fullness of the Holy Ghost
constantly day by day, there is nothing on the face of the earth that they could ask
for, that would not be given to them</i> (<i>Journal of Discourses, </i>vol. 11, p. 114).</p>
<p>Worshiping our Father in Heaven day by day is easy. Prayer is one way we can worship our
Father in Heaven. Daily scripture study is another. We can attend our church meetings &#8211; all three
blocks - accept callings and serving with an eye single to the glory of God; do our home teaching
and visiting teaching, attend devotional, read the Ensign and other Church publications. The list
of proper worship &#8211; putting love of God first - goes on and on. In considering when and how we
worship I would echo Alma&#8217;s words to the poorer Zormanites that had been cast out of their
churches because of their poverty: <i>&#8220;&#8230;do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in
your synagogues only? And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God
only once in a week?&#8221;</i> (Alma 32:10-11)</p>
<p>That last question infers that our practices of worship should be more than just on Sunday. To act
one way on Sunday and another way the rest of the week is being a double minded person that is
		<i>&#8220;&#8230;unstable in all his ways&#8221;</i> (James 1:8). Decreased faith comes from trying to serve two-masters &#8211; 
		<i>&#8220;&#8230;dividing our loyalty and allegiance between God and the world.&#8221;</i> (<i>In The Path of
Their Duty</i>, Elder David A. Bednar, Devotional September 1, 1998).</p>
<p>Carrying the natural man of the world becomes heavy requiring more of our energies thus
reducing our ability to believe, study, pray, serve and worship the object of our faith &#8211; God the
Father and Jesus Christ. Remember that the <i>&#8220;&#8230;natural man is an enemy of God&#8230;and will be
forever and ever...&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 3:19) thus destroying faith.</p>
<p>But by yielding <i>&#8220;&#8230;to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and [putting] off the natural
man&#8230;[and]&#8230;if ye give place, that a seed [of faith] may be planted in your heart&#8230;it will begin
to swell&#8230;for it beginneth to enlarge [your] soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten [your]
understanding, yea it beginneth to be delicious to [you]&#8230;Now behold would not this increase
your faith?&#8221;</i> (Mosiah 3:19; Alma 32:28-29)</p>
<p>Earlier I spoke of the Children of Israel and that they had the first fundamental of faith. As they
traveled through the wilderness for 40 years their faith increased as they increased their desire to
serve the Lord, to study, to pray, and worship properly. They struggled at times to put off the
natural man that they had acquired for centuries in Egypt. Each step they took in the wilderness
was a step of increasing their faith. They were taught simple ways to obey and worship. At one
time as they <i>&#8220;&#8230;journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea,&#8230;&#8221;</i> the people become
discouraged and started to complain again. In the twenty-first chapter of Numbers we read</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&#8230;Wherefore have ye (Moses) brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is
no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread (manna)&#8221;</i> (Numbers
21:4-5).</p>
<p>Their faith was being tested. They were tired of walking in the wilderness. They were without
water and they were tired of having the same bread (manna) every day. As the complaining of
the natural man increased their faith decreased. As recorded in Numbers 21 verse 6-9 the</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&#8230;Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel
died.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The fiery serpents got the peoples attention and they recognized their lack of faith. They asked
for forgiveness and that the serpents would be taken from them. As we read in verses 8 &amp; 9 the
Lord did not take the serpents from them, but prepared a way that they would be spared from the
deadly snakes. The Lord instructed Moses:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8230;Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that
every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass,
that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived.</i></p>
<p>This story illustrates the basic beginnings of increasing our faith. The required action
demonstrating their belief and faith was to simply look at the serpent of brass and they would be
saved. But because of how simple the action was many did not look and they died. Nephi put it
this way:<i> &#8220;...after they were bitten he (God) prepared a way that they might be healed; and the
labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or the
easiness of it, there were many who perished&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 17:41).</p>
<p>Now, my young friends and associates here at BYU-Idaho, we are much like the children of
Israel. We are at different stages in increasing our faith and overcoming our unbelief.
Metaphorically speaking our experiences and this campus is like unto the experiences and
wilderness the children of Israel went through. The seeds of faith were planted in your homes
prior to your coming to campus. At home you were under the tutelage of your parents or family
members. For many, living at home was easier because you simply believed &#8211; agreed with or
accepted what your parents did and told you. It was easy to go to church because it was the
&#8220;accepted&#8221; thing to do. It was easy to have family prayer, to maintain a curfew, and to control
the movies and television programs you watched. For some it may have been less easy but you
still accepted that way of living. Here you are facing your own fiery serpents daily being
subjected to the worldly ways of the natural man. If indulged in your faith will decrease. You are
given the opportunity to exercise your agency, now you must act on your own, you must increase
your faith and overcome your unbelief. Remember that part of the definition of faith is &#8230;<i>the
principle of action in intelligent beings</i>. How you act in the choices you make will either
increase or decrease your faith. The way is simple and easy. Like looking at the serpent of brass
simply look to the words of Christ, the words of the prophets, campus faculty, staff and
administration, and the words and example of your parents. Look to the temple and the
scriptures. If you feel that your faith is failing, weak or not increasing then check the six
fundamentals I have discussed - <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>belief, desire, study, prayer, service, worship</i></span>. Is one or more
missing in your life? Are you preoccupied with the cares of the world &#8211; social status, dress, car,
looks, etc. &#8211; which diminish faith and provide fertile soil for the seeds of unbelief to grow? As
Paul councils <i>&#8220;&#8230;the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
foolishness unto him neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned&#8221;</i> (1 Cor
2:14). While you are here take advantage of the opportunity of increasing your faith through
study, prayer, service and worship. Recall the words of Alma to his son Helaman in chapter 37</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&#8230;never be weary of good works&#8230;be meek and lowly in heart&#8230;for such shall find rest to their
souls&#8230;.learn wisdom in thy youth; yea learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God&#8221;</i>
(Alma 37:34, 35).</p>
<p>Then the warning and admonition:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8230;do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with
our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might
live; even so it is with us. The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live
forever&#8230;.yea see that ye look to God and live&#8230;</i> (Alma 37:46, 47)</p>
<p>If we believe, have righteous desires, study, pray, serve, and worship our faith will be increased.
To have our faith increased is good but it is not the end&#8230;as Peter says</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;<br />
</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;<br />
</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be
barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ</i> (2 Peter 1:5-8).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p>That our faith may neither be barren or unfruitful and our desire ever be &#8220;&#8230;Lord, increase our
faith, and help mine unbelief&#8221; is my prayer for us all in the name of our Savior and Redeemer,
even Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold"><i>&#8220;Finding Happiness in a Mortal World&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement</p>
<p style="text-align: center">August 20, 2004</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Elder Merrill J. Bateman</p>
<p>Each time I return to BYU-Idaho, I am struck by the transformation that has taken place. Striking
new buildings and verdant landscaping combine to create a beautiful academic and spiritual
setting. The new academic design with additional majors and courses, a large increase in faculty
and students, more efficient use of the facilities, and full accreditation by the Northwest
accrediting agency are little short of a miracle and reveal the creativity and diligence of the
school&#8217;s leadership. Tributes are due President and Sister Bednar, the administration, the faculty,
staff and the students for the marvelous changes that have occurred. I include the students
because your willingness to adjust to a year-round program has been critical to the overall
success. Also, one marvels at President Hinckley&#8217;s vision that gave impetus to the
transformation and the Board of Education&#8217;s willingness to provide financial support to make it a
reality.</p>
<p>While serving as president of Brigham Young University in Provo, commencements were among
my favorite experiences for two reasons. First, they were an exciting time because they
represented the successful completion of a long journey. Second, they were a family affair. The
campus was filled with fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, spouses, and friends. 
		</p>
<p>Commencement is a time for families to share in the accomplishments of their sons and
daughters, wives and husbands, mothers and fathers. Family members are often major
contributors to a student&#8217;s graduation. Today&#8217;s attendance suggests that BYU-Idaho
commencements are family oriented as well. I commend parents, grandparents, spouses and all
those who have contributed to the success of this graduating class. </p>
<p>I commend today&#8217;s graduates for achieving a major milestone&#8212;the reception of a certificate or a
baccalaureate. This is a significant accomplishment because it suggests that a foundation has
been laid for life-long learning. The purpose of a university is to provide students with the tools
and incentives to continue the learning process. Our Father in Heaven designed mortality so that
it could be an ever learning venture. The heavenly design of life&#8217;s experiences from early
childhood to old age is ordered so that each person may acquire light and knowledge from birth
to death. This is true both temporally and spiritually. The world is changing at an accelerating
pace. The half-life of scientific information is three to four years. In almost all forms of
employment, one must continue to learn or be left behind. In like manner, growth in spiritual
understanding must not cease with a mission, or the last religion class, or when the children are
gone and the nest is empty. Success in this world, both spiritual and temporal, requires that you
endure to the end in acquiring &#8220;knowledge and intelligence&#8221; from study and from experience.
Your future happiness depends on it.</p>
<p>Not only has each graduate acquired the tools for continued learning, but each has laid a
foundation for a happy life. You have been and are committed to living the fundamental
principles of the gospel. You know that happiness comes from righteous living. You understand
that <i>&#8220;wickedness never was happiness&#8221;</i> (Alma 41:10). Many have served missions and learned
that true happiness also comes from service to others, from losing oneself in a cause greater than
self (see Matthew 10:39). Many have served in campus volunteer organizations and all have
served in the Church. These experiences should help you understand the importance of service as
a means of obtaining joy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Happiness</span></p>
<p>My subject today is &#8220;Finding Happiness in a Mortal World.&#8221; The dictionary defines happiness as
the satisfaction derived from &#8220;[being] well-adapted; [of acting] appropriately&#8221; (<i>The American
Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</i>, American Heritage Publishing Co. and Houghton
Mifflin Co., N.Y., N.Y., 1969, 599). In general terms, it refers to the good feelings that come
from living true principles. It is important to know that<i> &#8220;happiness cannot be given, induced or
conferred&#8221; </i>(D. Brent Collette, &#8220;Spiritual Health Made Simple,&#8221; unpublished manuscript).
Parents cannot give or confer happiness upon their children although they can teach them how to
live <i>&#8220;after the manner of happiness&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 5:27). Happiness must be earned. It is the
byproduct of righteousness &#8211; of one&#8217;s thinking and behavior. Someone has said that &#8220;happiness
is different things for different people.&#8221; But happiness does not come from &#8220;things&#8221; at all. It is
not determined by &#8220;conditions, environment or possessions,&#8221; but stems from living one&#8217;s life in a
manner consistent with the purpose of one&#8217;s creation (Ibid).</p>
<p>Today I wish to discuss with you the purpose of your creation and how you can find happiness
given the critical decisions that lie ahead. I believe the period from 18 to 26 is one of the riskiest
and most challenging times of life. It is a time filled with major decisions that will affect you
through mortality and into the eternities. It is a time when many seem to lose direction and
purpose. Although parents and friends still provide counsel, life&#8217;s major decisions are yours. The
divine gift of agency is yours. Choices regarding further education, employment, marriage,
children plus most other decisions will, in the final analysis, be made by you. Your presence at
this graduation suggests that you have successfully navigated the first few years of this critical
period. Still, many important decisions lie ahead and, hopefully, wisdom will prevail and you
will continue traveling the path of happiness.</p>
<p>The scriptures clearly support the thesis that happiness comes from living a life congruent with
the purposes of creation (see 1 Nephi 8:10; Mosiah 2:41; Alma 3:26, 40:12-17; Doctrine and
Covenants 93:34). What are those purposes? Most people on this earth do not know. Fortunately,
the restored gospel provides a clear set of answers. According to the prophet Abraham, the Lord
created the earth so that we might be <i>&#8220;added upon&#8221;</i> (Abraham 3:26). What does that mean? I
believe there are three overarching ways in which mortality adds to our stature.</p>
<p>The first is the opportunity to continue the learning process. Pre-mortal life was filled with
learning. It was a world in which one acquired light. Faithful choices led some spirits to acquire
more light than others (see Abraham 3:18-19). We proved our willingness and ability to acquire
light through righteous choices in that first estate and, thus, earned the right to come here and
progress further. The divine intent is for us to continue the learning process on earth and have<i>
&#8220;glory added upon [our] heads for ever and ever&#8221;</i> (Abraham 3:25-26).</p>
<p>The second purpose is to receive a physical body&#8212;to obtain a tabernacle for our spirit. That is,
we were to be added upon physically. As will be noted later, the body is a very important
addition and is key to our ultimate destiny. </p>
<p>The third purpose is to initiate an eternal family&#8212;for us to become creators, to build an eternal
unit and enjoy the close, intimate relationships that are an inherent part of family life. The family
provides an opportunity for parents and siblings to participate with Deity in Their mission to
assist sons and daughters, and brothers and sisters achieve &#8220;immortality and eternal life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our happiness in this life and in the life to come depends on the degree to which we fulfill these
grand purposes. Therefore, let us examine each in more detail and suggest some principles by
which one may achieve the ends desired.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Spiritual Growth</span></p>
<p>Light is an attribute of Deity. The Apostle John states that <i>&#8220;God is light, and in him is no
darkness at all&#8221;</i> (1 John 1:5). Jesus stated that he was <i>&#8220;the light of the world&#8221;</i> (John 8:12). The
gospel is a message of light (see Doctrine and Covenants 45:9). A key, mortal objective for all of
God&#8217;s children is the acquisition of light&#8212;to become more like Him. In the Lord&#8217;s words, we
were to &#8220;prove&#8221; ourselves through obedience to His commandments (see Abraham 3:25). The
reward was added glory or light. The scriptures teach that <i>&#8220;The glory of God is intelligence, or,
in other words, light and truth&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 93:36). Spiritual growth is the
acquisition of intelligence or light and truth. One should know, however, that the Lord&#8217;s
definition of intelligence is more than the capacity to acquire and apply knowledge. It includes
one&#8217;s ability to distinguish between right and wrong and the power to choose the right. The
scriptures state that <i>&#8220;light and truth forsake that evil one&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 93:37).</p>
<p>The Lord has provided two sources of light to aid His children in finding truth. The first is the
Light of Christ. It is given to every person born on earth (see John 1:9; Doctrine and Covenants
84:46). According to Moroni, the <i>&#8220;Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good
from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do
good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ;
wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God&#8221;</i> (Moroni 7:16). This light, known
as our conscience, provides order in the universe, teaches people right from wrong; and, if
listened to, guides people to Christ and additional light (see Doctrine and Covenants 88:7-13).</p>
<p>An additional light is the Gift of the Holy Ghost which is given to the faithful who enter into
covenants with the Lord. This, even more intense than one's conscience, is conditional and
depends on one&#8217;s faithfulness in living the commandments (see Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-20). The Lord, speaking to the Prophet Joseph Smith, said:</p>
<p style="text-indent: -2in; margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -2in; margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in
the resurrection.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: -2in; margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2in"><i>
<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his
diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the
world to come. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this
world, upon which all blessings are predicated&#8212;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to
that law upon which it is predicated</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-21).</p>
<p>Growth is also a function of experience, and the knowledge acquired early in life becomes a
foundation to learn from later experiences. Experiential learning is spread throughout life and
comes in small parcels. Nephi understood this principle well when he said that the Lord gives:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed
are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for
they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from
them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that
which they have</i> (2 Nephi 28:30).</p>
<p>Now what can you do to assure future spiritual growth. First, make a commitment to pray and
study the scriptures daily. Prayer and scripture study bring the Spirit. The Lord told the Prophet
Joseph Smith that when we read the scriptures, we may hear his voice (see Doctrine and
Covenants 18:34-36). In another place, He states that his <i>&#8220;voice is Spirit&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 88:66). Consistent prayer and study of the word will aid the Holy Spirit in speaking to
		<i>&#8220;your mind and . . . your heart&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 8:2). When the righteous thoughts of
the mind connect with the righteous feelings of the heart, the result is power and testimony.</p>
<p>I also recommend that you have a secular reading program. Make a list of some great books.
Devote some time daily to increase your understanding of things</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>in the earth . . . things which have been, things which are, things which must
shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the
wars and the perplexities of the nations, . . . and a knowledge also of countries
and of kingdoms </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:79).</p>
<p>Those who develop a well-rounded reading program and understand world developments will be
more effective servants in the Lord&#8217;s kingdom.</p>
<p>Also, determine that you will be a servant to others. Reach out to other people and befriend
them. Never turn down a calling in the Kingdom. Perform quiet acts of service. If you learn of
someone in need, do what you can to assist them.</p>
<p>In the Alma, chapter 44, Captain Moroni explains to the leader of the Lamanites that the Nephite
army&#8217;s strength comes from living according to the <i>&#8220;sacred word of God&#8221;</i> and then adds 
		<i>&#8220;to
which we owe all our happiness&#8221; </i>(Alma 44:5). Your future happiness is dependent on your
spiritual health, and one&#8217;s spiritual health is determined by the nourishment that comes from
prayer, study and service.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The Physical Body</span></p>
<p>The second way in which mortality adds to our being is the addition of a physical body. The
scriptures teach that the body is not only important for this life but also for eternity. In fact, the
body is so important that Christ gave His life to overcome physical as well as spiritual death. In
doing so, he made possible a resurrection for everyone and the restoration of the body to the
spirit forever (see 1 Corinthians 15:19-22). </p>
<p>In contrast, most of Christianity believes that physical matter, including the body, is evil and that
the body will be discarded at death. This idea, adopted from the Greeks, is one of the heresies of
the Great Apostasy. The true doctrine is that the physical body is one of the great gifts of life.
This truth is illustrated by the story in Matthew in which the Lord called evil spirits out of the
men in Gergesa, and they chose to enter the bodies of a lowly herd of pigs in order to obtain a
tabernacle for their spirits (see Matthew 8:28-32).</p>
<p>Joseph Smith said: <i>&#8220;We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before
God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body&#8221;</i>
(Joseph Smith, <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 181).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Body: An Instrument for the Mind</span></p>
<p>Why is the physical body so important? How does the body relate to our happiness here and
hereafter? What are its divine purposes? I believe there are at least three. First, the body is a
tabernacle for the mind and spirit. It is also an instrument of the mind. President Boyd K. Packer
taught this concept in a CES satellite broadcast two years ago. In a physical world, the body,
directed by the mind, is able to perform physical acts. Many acts of love, kindness and service
require the physical body. When appropriately directed, physical acts are a means for blessing
others and produce great joy. No doubt, a personage of spirit is able to do many things to help
others, but the physical body increases the range of activities that can be performed. In fact,
President Joseph F. Smith, in his vision of the spirit world, learned that <i>&#8220;the dead . . . looked
upon the long absence of their spirits from their bodies as a bondage</i>&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenants
138:50).</p>
<p>When we enter the spirit world we will learn just how important the body is and will yearn for
the resurrection and the freedom it brings. On resurrection day, when our body and spirit are
inseparably connected, it will be possible to experience a fulness of joy (see Doctrine and
Covenants 93:33).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Body: A Receptacle for Light</span></p>
<p>Second, the body is a receptacle for light. Both the spirit and the body can receive and hold light.
Alma states that <i>&#8220;their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word&#8221;</i> (Alma 5:7).
The Lord, in speaking to the Prophet Joseph Smith, states <i>&#8220;And if your eye be single to my glory,
your whole bodies shall be filled with light&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:67). Those who live the
gospel have light added to their being while in mortality. Their countenances are brighter than
those who do not keep the commandments. </p>
<p>Resurrected bodies also differ with respect to the amount of light within. In Section 76 of the
Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord states: <i>&#8220;These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose
glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all&#8221; </i>(v. 70). Speaking of the
honorable men and women of the earth who do not fully accept the gospel, the scriptures state:
		<i>&#8220;Wherefore, they are bodies terrestrial, and not bodies celestial, and differ in glory as the moon
differs from the sun&#8221; </i>( Doctrine and Covenants 76:78).</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul makes clear that resurrected bodies will differ in terms of the amount of light
or glory they contain. He said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they
come? . . . </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh
of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the
celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of
the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in
incorruption:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in
power</i> (1 Cor. 15:35, 39-43).</p>
<p>The glory or light and the type of body received in the resurrection will be based on one&#8217;s
faithfulness and will differ in terms of light or glory. A celestial body will be filled with more
light than a terrestial or a telestial body. For the faithful, those who enter into appropriate
covenants and ordinances and live accordingly, the Savior&#8217;s atoning power will cleanse and
sanctify their souls and raise their physical bodies from the dust incorruptible, in celestial glory
and with celestial power.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul confirms the importance and sacredness of the physical body when he states:<i>
&#8220;Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any
man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple
ye are &#8221;</i> (1 Cor. 3:16-17).</p>
<p>Not only is the body sacred because it houses our spirit, it is sacred because it has the potential to
be a tabernacle for the Holy Ghost. As a personage of spirit, He can administer directly to our
spirit and add light and truth to our soul (see Doctrine and Covenants 130:22).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Body: The Sacred Powers of Creation</span></p>
<p>Third, the body houses the sacred powers of creation which allow us to have children and begin
an eternal family. In mortality, we have that power for a limited period of time. We are tested in
the use of it. It is important that the spirit learn to control the body and use this power within the
bounds set by our Heavenly Father. If we prove worthy, the power will be returned to us in the
resurrection. So many people on this earth treat these powers lightly. They allow their animal
instincts to overpower the signals sent by the Light of Christ. Alma told his son, Shiblon, that it
was important to <i>&#8220;bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love&#8221;</i> (Alma 38:12).
Appropriate use of the powers of creation brings love into one&#8217;s life. Inappropriate use causes a
loss of light and love. Love is a primary source of happiness.</p>
<p>Given the importance of the physical body, one must manage carefully its cleanliness inside and
out. Modest dress is one way we can show respect for it. Avoiding the ingestion of harmful
substances is another. Proper diet is a third. Those who understand the magnitude of the gift will
not plaster it with graffiti. Those who desire happiness will treat it as the sacred gift that it is. 
		</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">An Eternal Family</span></p>
<p>Marriage between a man and a woman for time and eternity is the basis of an eternal family&#8212;the
third great purpose of creation. In a civil marriage, the relationship established is
bilateral&#8212;between the man and the woman. The temple covenant which forms the basis for an
eternal family is triangular in nature. It not only involves the relationship between the man and
the woman, but one between the man and the Lord, and another between the woman and the
Lord. If the man and the woman abide by the promises made, the family unit becomes eternal in
nature and extends beyond the grave.</p>
<p>I believe that the greatest happiness in life comes inside the family unit. The love between a man
and a woman and the close, warm relationships between parents and children help people
become well-adapted and truly fulfilled.</p>
<p>Most of you will marry within the next few years. As you look for a companion, the following
suggestions may be of help. First, do not expect perfection. It doesn&#8217;t exist. This is mortality, not
eternity. Rather, look for a person who will be your best friend. Look for a person with whom
you can easily converse. The two of you should have a few things in common, but not all things.
Differences create opportunities to learn and grow together. Look for a person who has a
sensitivity to sacred things and a strong, personal testimony of the Savior. Engage in a number of
different activities before commitments are made. In this way you will see each other under
different circumstances and will be able to gauge how each responds to different stimuli. Finally,
look for a peaceful feeling in your hearts as you contemplate life together.</p>
<p>For those who do not marry for one reason or another, become engaged in your siblings&#8217; or
friends&#8217; families. Become a great uncle or aunt. Learn to enjoy children and take every
opportunity to teach them the lessons you have learned. My wife and I have a dear friend who
did this with our family when the children were younger. Whenever she came to our home, she
came prepared with books to read, games to play and witty conversation. The children loved her
and looked forward to her visits. She was an integral part of our family until an accident took her
life.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, happiness is found in spiritual growth, in the blessings of a physical body,
and in the family unit. At this graduation, you stand at a crossroad in life. Happiness lies ahead if
you will do your best, indeed your &#8220;very best&#8221; with the following: continue to study the gospel,
pray with even more earnestness, extend yourself in service to others, treat your body with great
respect, and deeply commit to the creation of an eternal family. May the Lord bless you to this
end is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As you celebrate your graduation today and leave BYU-Idaho, I hope you also have become
"quick to observe."  Your future success and happiness will, in large measure, be determined by
the spiritual capacity to be quick to observe.  Let us together for just a few minutes consider the
significance of this important spiritual gift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As used in the scriptures, the word 
		<i>observe </i>has two primary uses.  One use denotes to obey or to
keep&#8212;as is evident in verse 6 of section 54 in the Doctrine and Covenants: 
		<i>But blessed are they
who have kept the covenant and <span style="font-weight: bold">observed</span> the commandment, for they shall obtain mercy</i> 
(emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The second use of the word observe suggests to look or to see or to notice&#8212;as we learn in Isaiah
42:20: <i>Seeing many things, but thou <span style="font-weight: bold">observest</span> not; opening the ears, but he heareth not
		</i>(emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Thus, when you and I are "quick to observe," we promptly obey or look or notice.  Let me now
share three examples of the lessons that can be learned when you and I are blessed to be quick to
observe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have a very dear friend who served as a stake president.  The patriarch in the stake over which
this friend presided had experienced some health challenges and was unable to perform in his
calling.  The ailing patriarch had difficulty walking and moving about, and his strength was
limited.  One Sabbath afternoon this good stake president visited the home of the patriarch to
encourage him and check on his well-being.  As the stake president entered the home, he found
the patriarch dressed in his suit and white shirt and tie&#8212;sitting in a recliner in the front room. 
The stake president greeted the patriarch and, knowing how hard it must have been to dress
himself, graciously suggested to the patriarch that it was not necessary to get dressed up on
Sunday or to meet visitors.  In a kind but firm voice, the patriarch rebuked the stake president
and said, "Don&#8217;t you know that this is the only way I have left to show the Lord how much I love
Him?"  My friend, the stake president, was quick to observe.  He both heard and felt the lesson,
and he never forgot it.  The spiritual ability to see and to hear and to remember that lesson about
reverence and worship was a great blessing in his life&#8212;and subsequently in the lives of many
others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Before attending her sacrament meetings, Sister Bednar frequently prays for the spiritual eyes to
see those who have a particular need.  Often as she looks and observes the brothers and sisters
and children in the congregation, she will receive a spiritual nudge to visit with or make a phone
call to a particular person.  And when Sister Bednar receives such an impression, she is quick to
observe and to respond and to obey.  It often is the case that as soon as the "amen" is spoken in
the benediction, she will talk with a teenager or hug a sister or, upon returning home,
immediately pick up the phone and make a call.  As long as I have known Sister Bednar, people
have marveled at her capacity to discern and respond to their needs.  So often they will ask her,
"Sister Bednar, how did you know?"  The spiritual gift whereby she has been enabled to see and
to act promptly has been a great blessing in the lives of many people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">At the conclusion of our June Board of Trustees meeting in Salt Lake City, President Hinckley
invited Elder David B. Haight to offer the benediction.  At the age of 97, Elder Haight had some
difficulty as he tried to stand and offer the prayer.  After Elder Haight had made several attempts
to rise to his feet, President Hinckley courteously said, "David, it is all right"&#8212;suggesting, I
believe, that it was permissible for Elder Haight to remain in his chair and offer the prayer. 
Elder Haight responded in a voice that was both firm and appropriate and said, "President, I must
stand!"  There was simply no way that mighty Apostle was going to sit and pray in the presence
of the First Presidency and his colleagues of the Quorum of the Twelve.  And, more importantly,
he was not going to sit as he communicated with his Heavenly Father.  So once again Elder
Haight struggled to stand&#8212;and finally was successful.  I shall never forget the spirit I felt as I
listened to Elder Haight pray.  I hope on that occasion I was quick to observe a powerful lesson
about the dignity and the reverence and the spirit that should attend our prayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Quick to observe.  Prompt to watch and to obey.  Such a simple gift that can bless us
individually and in our families and extend blessings to so many other people.  Each of us can
and should strive to be worthy of this significant spiritual gift.  I pray that as you now depart
BYU-Idaho that you, indeed, are and will continue to be "quick to observe."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I would now like to conclude on a personal note and express the love that Sister Bednar and I
have for each of you.  We have so much enjoyed visiting with you on campus and in your
apartments, participating with you in home evenings, talking about your challenges and your
opportunities, attempting to answer your questions, and becoming better acquainted.  We will
miss you.  And we would love to hear from you.  Please be sure to keep in contact and let us
know about the things that are happening in your lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Today you graduates become official alumni of Brigham Young University-Idaho, and you now
have the responsibility to help the world better understand who we are and what we do at this
remarkable institution.  Indeed, you have been called to assist in fulfilling the prophesies about
this school.  How you live, what you do, and what you become will ultimately define this
university.  May the Lord bless you as you always remember Him and serve Him with faith and
with diligence and with devotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As each of our sons has left our home for college or to serve a mission, Sister Bednar and I have
shared with them the following counsel:</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to meet and worship with you this afternoon.  I pray
for and invite the companionship of the Holy Ghost as together we consider some of the
remarkable events that are taking place on the campus of Brigham Young University</span><font face="Times New Roman">â</font><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">Idaho.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		After returning home from their missions, each of our sons has been blessed to teach in
the missionary training center in Provo.  Because of their experiences at the MTC and because of
my service as a Seventy, whenever we are all together we invariably end up talking about what is
happening at the MTC, about missions and missionaries and missionary work, and about what
and how the new elders and sisters are being trained and taught.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		As we recently were together talking about the MTC, I began to think about the 17
missionary training centers that are located throughout the world.  It occurred to me that all of
the missionary training centers have the following characteristics in common:</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">

number. </span></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in">

<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">

<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in">

<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		Now please pay particular attention to this next characteristic:</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.6875in; margin-left: 0.6875in">

<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		As I considered these similarities, I was struck by the fact that Brigham Young
University</span><font face="Times New Roman">â</font><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">Idaho in Rexburg possesses these same characteristics. </span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		Brothers and sisters, it should be obvious to all of us that something spiritually significant
is taking place in Rexburg, Idaho.  The announcement in June of 2000 that Ricks College would
become Brigham Young University</span><font face="Times New Roman">â</font><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">Idaho was much more than the establishing of a new
baccalaureate degree granting institution.  The addition of new faculty and other employees is
not simply about covering classes and meeting staffing needs.  The construction on and
remodeling of this campus are about so much more than new laboratories and classrooms and
study areas.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		Let me suggest that in Rexburg, Idaho, we are in the process of creating not a missionary
training center (MTC), but a Disciple Preparation Center&#8212;a DPC.  In this special and sacred and
set apart place, you and I have access to unparalleled spiritual resources that can assist us in
developing and deepening our devotion as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.  That is the primary
and most important reason for the existence of Brigham Young University-Idaho and for its
sponsorship by and affiliation with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold; font-size:12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">A Disciple Preparation Center (DPC)</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		Let us now pay particular attention to the three words that make up the phrase I just
introduced: disciple, preparation, and center.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		A 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">disciple</span> is one who follows or attends upon another for the express purpose of learning 
(Oxford English Dictionary On-Line, second edition, 1989).  Please note that a disciple both
follows and learns, as the following scriptures highlight:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">. . . I am the light of the world: he that 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>followeth</i></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>me</i></span> shall not walk in
darkness, but shall have the light of life.  (John 8:12; emphasis added)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">Take my yoke upon you, and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold"><i>learn of me</i></span>; for I am meek and lowly in
heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.  (Matthew 11:28-30;
emphasis added)</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		Thus, a disciple of Christ is a follower of Jesus who learns of and from Him and lives
according to His teachings.  As we learn in Doctrine and Covenants 41:5:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">He that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that
saith he receiveth it and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple, and shall be cast
out from among you.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		A disciple of Christ is one who is following and learning to be like Christ&#8212;learning to
think, to feel, and to act as He does.  He or she is striving to gain &#8220;. . . the mind of Christ&#8221;
(1&#160;Corinthians 2:16).  Becoming a true disciple of the Savior and following His ways are the
most demanding learning objectives we can ever strive to achieve.  No other discipline compares
with His curriculum in either requirements or rewards.  Discipleship demands the total
transformation of a person by putting off the natural man and becoming a saint through the
Atonement of Christ the Lord (see Mosiah 3:19).  A disciple is one who loves the Lord and
serves Him with all of his or her heart, might, mind, and strength.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		The word 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">preparation</span> implies the process of making or getting ready; the previous
putting or setting in order for any action or purpose (Oxford English Dictionary On-Line, second
edition, 1989).  And one of the common uses of the word 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">center</span> connotes a point from which
things and influences originate or emanate (Oxford English Dictionary On-Line, second edition,
1989).  Taken together, these three words, disciple preparation center, suggest to me a place in
which followers of the Master learn and are set in order and are made ready&#8212;and from which
their influence flows into the world.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		What is it that makes this campus such a powerful Disciple Preparation Center (DPC)? 
Let me suggest three factors that contribute to the spiritual strength that is available here. 
(1)&#160;This institution of higher education is a temple of learning; (2) this institution will be located
next to a holy temple, even a House of the Lord; and (3) this institution is surrounded by strong
stakes of Zion.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		Our daughter-in-law, Charlotte, graduated from the nursing program at BYU-Provo in
April of 2003.  Our family was delighted to attend her graduation ceremony and to celebrate her
accomplishment.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		Over the years of our service together, I have developed a great affection for and
relationship with Elder Merrill Bateman; and I knew this graduation ceremony was to be his
final commencement as the president of that institution.  So I listened with particular attention to
his message to the graduates.  I was most intrigued by his use of a verse from Isaiah and his
explication of that verse:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord&#8217;s
house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above
the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the
mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his
ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem.  (Isaiah&#160;2:2-3)</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		Elder Bateman then proceeded to describe how the instructional 
		facilities on the campuses of the universities affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have
been dedicated to the God of Jacob and are a portion of what is referred to in Isaiah&#8212;a part of
the Lord&#8217;s house that has been established in the tops of the mountains wherein He will teach us
of His ways.  Now, we all know that these verses refer to the House of the Lord, to the holy
temples.  But what came into my mind as I listened to Elder Bateman was this thought: we are
blessed to have the House of the Lord, and we also are blessed to have temples of learning.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		BYU</span><font face="Times New Roman">â</font><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">Idaho, brothers and sisters, is a temple of learning.  I have tried to use that phrase
carefully so as to not confuse the House of the Lord with a temple of learning.  But there are
important patterns and parallels between the House of the Lord and temples of learning, with
temples of learning referring specifically to the institutions of higher education sponsored by and
affiliated with the Church.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		In both the House of the Lord and in the temples of learning, a standard of worthiness
must be met in order to enter and to learn what is being taught.  For a member who desires a
temple recommend and for a student who wishes to enter into one of the temples of learning,
there is a standard of worthiness.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		Interestingly, in both the holy temple and in temples of learning, a significant personal
commitment is linked to the learning process.  Consider, brothers and sisters, that in the House
of the Lord we come under covenant and bind ourselves to act in all holiness.  In a similar way,
students who are admitted to study and learn in the temples of learning make a commitment to
keep the commandments of God and to abide by the university honor and dress codes.  Thus,
covenants and commitments expand our education in the House of the Lord and in the Church&#8217;s
temples of learning.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		In both the House of the Lord and in a temple of learning, as a result of what we
experience and what we learn and what we feel, we then strive to heed a higher standard.  That is
the outcome and the result of what we learn.  Consequently, we prepare a little harder, dress a
little nicer, act a little better, and think more deeply about things that really matter.</span></p>

		At the time of his call to become the fourteenth president of the Church, President
Howard W. Hunter issued an invitation for &#8220;. . . all members of the Church to establish the
temple of the Lord as the great symbol of their membership and the supernal setting for their
most sacred covenants&#8221; (Howard W. Hunter, <i>The Great Symbol of Our Membership</i>, 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>,
October 1994, p.&#160;2).  Brothers and sisters, temples are holy; temples are sacred places for
learning about and entering into eternal covenants; temples are places of peace and of revelation. 
Temples are eternal links: between heaven and earth; between past, present, and future; between
the living and the dead; between time and eternity; between husbands and wives, parents and
children; and between men and women with Christ.  It is in the House of the Lord that things of
the earth are joined with the things of heaven.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">Every temple that this Church has built has in effect stood as a monument
to our belief in the immortality of the human soul, that this phase of mortal life
through which we pass is part of a continuous upward climb . . . and that as
certain as there is life here, there will be life there.  That is our firm belief.  It
comes about through the Atonement of the Savior, and the temple becomes . . .
the bridge from this life to the next.  The temple is concerned with things of
immortality.  We wouldn&#8217;t have to build a temple for marriages if we didn&#8217;t
believe in the eternity of the family.  We build it so the family may be eternal. 
All of the ordinances which take place in the house of the Lord become
expressions of our belief in that fundamental and basic doctrine.  The temple
therefore becomes the ultimate in our system of worship and therefore is of great
and significant importance to us.  (Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>Inspirational Thoughts</i>,

<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		The temple as a quiet but consistent reminder in our midst of the centrality of Jesus
Christ and of the immortality of the soul cannot but elevate the quality of our education and the
depth and beauty of our associations.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
		Several years ago, Elder L. Tom Perry visited our campus and was asked the following
question by a faculty member: &#8220;Elder Perry, what do you see as the looming storm clouds on the
horizon about which we should know so we can better teach and prepare the young people of the
Church?&#8221;  With no hesitation his answer was, &#8220;Worldliness.&#8221;  The next question: &#8220;What can we
do, Elder Perry, to best help the young people combat worldliness?&#8221;  His answer: &#8220;Help them
prepare to worship properly in the temple.&#8221;</span></p>

		As you are well aware, we have devotional speakers every Tuesday&#8212;many of whom are
emeritus General Authorities or Brethren who have been released after serving in the Second
Quorum of the Seventy.  A significant number of those Brethren, after being released as General
Authorities, have served as temple presidents.  As Sister Bednar and I host these Brethren, I ask
each one of them this question: &#8220;What did you learn serving in the temple that you wish you had
better known or understood or appreciated when you were a General Authority?&#8221;  I have asked
that question to many of the Brethren, and the consistency of their answers is striking!  The
following response by Elder J. Ballard Washburn is representative of so many of the answers I
have received:</span></p>

There is a difference between church-attending, tithe-paying members who
occasionally rush into the temple to go through a session and those members who
faithfully and consistently worship in the temple.</span></p>

		Brothers and sisters, please remember that penetrating statement by Elder Washburn:
&#8220;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;the protection available in the temple and through our covenants.&#8221;  I pray that we will begin
to understand the significance of what was announced last December.  The Rexburg temple will
contribute to a potent and powerfully protected place of preparation for disciples of Christ who
will be an influence for good all over the earth.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: bold">DPC Lesson #1.  
		</span>A disciple&#8217;s faith is focused upon the Son of God.  Brothers and sisters,
the first principle of the gospel is not simply faith; rather, the first principle of the gospel is faith
in the Lord Jesus Christ.  Saving faith centers in the Savior and through Him in the Father (see
Bruce R. McConkie, <span style="text-decoration: underline">A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</span>, p. 164).  The faith of a true
disciple is focused upon and rooted in the Savior and Redeemer, even the Lord Jesus Christ.  As
we read in Hebrews 12:2:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
		&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy
that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at
the right hand of the throne of God.</span></p>
<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, monospace">
<span style="font-weight: bold">DPC Lesson #2.</span>  A disciple recognizes that faith in the Savior is a spiritual gift and
appropriately seeks for that gift in his or her life.  Faith is not a trait to be developed or a reward
to be earned.  Rather, it is a gift we receive from God.  Scriptural synonyms for faith include
trust, confidence, and reliance.  Thus, the spiritual gift of faith enables us to trust in Christ and to
have confidence in His power to cleanse, to renew, to redeem, and to strengthen us.  Faith means
we are beginning to rely upon His merits, mercy, and grace (2 Nephi 2:8; 31:19; Moroni 6:4). 
Indeed, you and I have a responsibility to properly seek after this gift; and we must do all that we
can do to qualify for the gift of faith.  Ultimately, however, the gift is bestowed upon us by a
loving and caring God.  Elder James E. Talmage indicated in his classic book 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Articles of
Faith</span> that faith is a gift from God.</span></p>

nevertheless a divine gift [and can be obtained only from God (see

Moroni 10:11)].  As is fitting for so priceless a pearl, it is given to those only who
show by their sincerity that they are worthy of it, and who give promise of
abiding by its dictates.</span></p>

swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be
accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.  (Statement of
the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Wentworth Letter, written March 1, 1842.  See

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">Last fall I witnessed an incident that made a vivid impression on me.  Visualize in your
mind a warm, sunny, autumn afternoon in Rexburg, Idaho.  I had parked my van in the parking
area and was walking toward the front door of the downtown post office to mail some packages
inside.  On the sidewalk in front of me, I noticed a grandmother with her small grandson in tow
making their way toward the open door of the building.  I remember thinking to myself how fun
it must have been for that grandmother to run errands with her little grandson, when suddenly the
little boy released his grasp from his grandmother&#8217;s hand and sprinted impulsively toward what
he thought was the open door of the post office.  His grandmother could see the inevitable, but
her warning cry was not heard nor heeded.  What the small child thought was an open door was
actually a solid glass window panel adjacent to the door.  This poor little boy smashed head-on
into the glass panel.  Stunned, he turned around to frantically search for his grandmother.  Maybe
it was the way this woman instinctively scooped up her crying and hurt grandson and clutched
him tight in her arms that impressed me so.  Or, perhaps, it was the way she lovingly consoled
him and tenderly wiped the blood from his nose and face.  Anyway, I was touched as I saw the
Savior&#8217;s loving arms personified in the arms of that grandmother.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', monospace">If we open our scriptures to page 16 in the topical guide, we will discover many
scriptural references to the word arm and will notice that the Lord&#8217;s arm is a mighty symbol for

<p>My dear young and not so young Brothers and Sisters: Sister Tobler and I have come to this
remarkable school with much joy and anticipation. We were here a number of years ago, but
much has changed with respect to the campus, the size of the student body and the expansion of
the faculty and administration for what has become a full-fledged university. We have watched
as each step has unfolded and felt a sense of admiration and deep respect for those who have
guided the many academic and campus changes over the past several years.</p>
<p>It is always a joy to be with President and Sister Bednar who have been deeply involved in all that has taken place here over the past number of years. We would also like to mention the joy we have had in working with two wonderful couples who have been associated with BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho for many years. President and Sister Kinghorn of the Albania Tirana Mission and President and Sister Strong of the Croatia Zagreb Mission are dear to our hearts as we saw their great faith and commitment in presiding over those missions and the Church in the Europe Central Area. Now we are all awaiting the start of a new House of the Lord with all of its blessings to the 
		student body, faculty and surrounding members in this area. Having been involved in the groundbreaking, construction and dedication or rededication of four temples in Europe over the past several years, we know the great joy this brings to all who prepare to walk through those sacred doors.</p>
<p>As we look into your wonderful faces today, we can't help but be reminded of the great heritage and transcendent prospects we individually have. Most of you today are on the very front end of both understanding and preparing for the potential to become what most of you, and I would say, most of us, do not yet fully comprehend. Hopefully today we can receive impressions through
the power of the Holy Ghost of the unusual potential, both temporally and eternally, in each of
us, and be committed to leave no stones unturned in achieving that potential in an acceptable and moral way.</p>
<p>Many years ago when I was a very young teenager, I thought often about what would ever
become of me. I felt academically capable, but realized that socially I was a slow developer as
many of my school mates will remember and readily confirm. I was born into a wonderful
family, the second of four children. Our parents were good people and excellent teachers-both
had taught school for a number of years. They had a keen sense of what was right and what was
wrong and reinforced those values constantly as we were growing up. Sometimes we would, in a
tongue in cheek sense, think of their strong views as the Gospel of Mother Louise and of Father
Don. Both were committed to the Gospel and the Church, and we were without any doubts about
their commitments. We were coached well, and sometimes firmly when needed, and we knew
they expected us to develop our individual capabilities and potential. I remember on several
occasions, Mother would remind us about the importance of self-confidence and believing in our
potential by saying, &#8220;if you don't think you are somebody, no one else will either.&#8221; This was not
a commission to have an ego trip or to develop a superiority complex.</p>
<p>Even with all of this good teaching and example, there remained for me a deep wonder of what</p>
<p>should or could I do with my life. How would I earn a living for a family in the coming years
and how could I gain a higher level of confidence in myself and be able to develop trust in others
who could play significant roles in my life? While I had many thoughts about how I would cope
in world, I would also wonder when older people would talk in sacrament meeting about
reaching, in the end, the blessing of eternal life not just for me but for as yet a family that was
not yet in the process of formation. Perhaps you have also faced similar questions about your
futures.</p>
<p>Now, almost sixty years later I can look back and see and understand some things I didn't understand too well at the time. I'd like to share a few thoughts about these important matters with you today. There may be nothing particularly profound, but maybe they might be helpful in some small way.</p>
<p>First, I have learned how important it really is to develop a healthy belief in ourselves. Some
seem to be born with it. Others may have to work much harder at this important task. It is not
just to believe in ourselves, but also to believe and see ourselves as capable of achieving good
and lofty goals. This is not an encouragement to develop an arrogant pride or ego with all of the
unfortunate implications, but it is an encouragement to have a healthy, even inspiring, regard for
who we are and what we can do. For many years, I have found encouragement from the Lord's
statement of His reliance on humble but confident people. In the Doctrine and Covenants,
section 1, we have all read many times these choice verses speaking about the unfolding
Restoration preparatory to the Second Coming of the Lord:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Therefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the
inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake
unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments; </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And also gave commandments 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">to others</span>, that they should proclaim these things
unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which was written by the
prophets-</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and
strong ones</span></i> (Doctrine and Covenants 1:17-19, emphasis added).</p>
<p>We must believe in ourselves and realize that even in our weakness, the Lord is able and will
make us strong and effective people.</p>
<p>I have also learned that a very high cost is associated with depreciating ourselves, or as some
say, beating up on ourselves often unjustly. Now it is easier for me to understand and believe
that when we become so negative and injurious to ourselves, our Father in Heaven must wonder,
how can a spirit son or daughter, carrying my genetics in their spirit, think of themselves in such
a way? He knows, and we know, we have flaws which must be dealt with. But He knows, and
we should know, that we are valuable and capable children of a loving Father in Heaven.</p>
<p>In developing a healthy belief in ourselves, there is a helpful gospel parallel with respect to the process of how we come to believe in the Savior, our Redeemer. Just as a wanting to believe in the Savior precedes the establishment of a faith in Christ and His Gospel, a desire to believe in oneself must become kindling to the larger fire of truly having an active, deep faith in ourselves. To assist us in the quest for having a deep faith in ourselves, Heavenly Father, knowing our strengths and our weaknesses, often places people in our lives to stimulate our belief in
ourselves. That stimulation may come from a number of sources or people. It may come from a
Primary or Sunday School teacher. It may come from a Bishop. It may be a Stake Patriarch. It
may be your Priesthood Advisor or a Young Women's leader. It may be a Mission President. It
may be your Mom and Dad. From whatever credible source it may come, please do not take
lightly the impressions or counsel which come of the Holy Ghost to you through their
outreaching love and concerns. You might be tempted to be a bit cynical or give little worth to
some of the things that they might say to you. Be accepting and appreciate of their outreach. Be
believing and not cynical.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the wonderful teaching of Alma about the progression as we move from believing to having strong and active faith. He pleads with us to be positive and even to experiment:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment
upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than
desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that
ye can give place for a portion of my words</i> (Alma 32:27).</p>
<p>The early development of belief in myself was shaped in a wonderful way by a Stake Patriarch
who didn't really know me. He was very old, very wise and very in tune with the Holy Ghost. He
may not have known my need for reassurance and direction in those teenage years, but the Holy
Ghost did and revealed to him what to say to me. Perhaps I was hungry and ready to believe, but
I remember how my feelings changed about my capabilities and future after that wonderful
blessing. Those words caused me to believe much more concretely in myself and to do my part
to make that blessing become reality.</p>
<p>This leads to the second great principle which I learned and tested over the years. My experience has confirmed that it is a true principle. Once we believe in ourselves and have a vision of what
is possible for us, we must follow a pattern of preparation and hard work that would be in
harmony with the blessing he voiced, in my particular situation. Achieving our potential will not
come by wishing or dreaming. It will follow the Law of the Harvest. Being a farm boy, and now
watching the land preparation on our farm in Ohio, the planting of crops, the control of weeds,
etc., there is a protocol of work, of particular actions and caring that precede a good harvest. We
must follow these principles as we work to achieve our very significant potentials.</p>
<p>As I sought to bring into reality the blessings promised in my patriarchal blessing, I had to learn that when we receive information and direction in our lives, we must act upon it. If we don't, the blessing simply remains information which has limited value, if not acted upon. Having been
told by the Spirit through a patriarch that I was to prepare for what should be a career in the
business world, I knew I had a lot of study and preparation ahead of me, in the remaining years
in high school, in college and ultimately on the job. But the gift of a fuller vision of myself, and
of the outcome if I would prepare and be faithful, has remained with me all of these years. You,
too, will receive important messages from time to time. Don't treat these messages as
information. Please act upon them for they are revelations for you which have eternal
significance if you will have the faith to act, to work hard, and be sustained by the Spirit in your
converting that information into an eternal reality.</p>
<p>Another ministering brother who helped me climb the confidence ladder was my mission
president. I am sure that there are many here today who will also forever thank the Lord for these
wonderful, consecrated servants and their wives. His contribution to my life was to help me
focus clearly and specifically on the quest for eternal life. My earlier experiences had great
temporal significance, but my mission president&#8217;s lasting mark upon my soul is and will always
be eternal. He helped me see myself as capable of achieving the promise of eternal life.</p>
<p>It became clear to me very early in my mission in Switzerland and Austria that he possessed
special knowledge and had a testimony of the Savior that was vibrant and compelling. In some manner, I developed the desire to know what he knew and have such simple but powerful faith and testimony. It was not that I was without a testimony. The teachings of my mother and father were written in many ways on my soul, and my own prayers regarding the truthfulness of the gospel were answered in wonderful ways. But here was a man who seemed to actually live in the light. As we would drive together often during one part of my mission, these became times of</p>
<p>learning, of becoming better acquainted through his teachings of who the Savior is, and of our Heavenly Father and His plan for us. I wanted to know what he knew and try to be faithful and in tune as he was. I have learned much from Young Nephi in the Book of Mormon. Nephi experienced the same feeling of wanting to know more, to have more light and understanding of</p>
<p>eternal things. He wanted to know what his father knew. Quoting from 1 Nephi 2:16:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being
large in stature, and having great desires to know of the mysteries of God,
wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my
heart that I did believe all of the words which had been spoken by my father.</i></p>
<p>Nephi was deeply impacted by the truths of eternal life taught him by the Lord. We should not wonder why he became the prophet and Man of God that we love in the Book of Mormon. I do understand and am deeply grateful for the transforming power of knowledge of the Godhead and
of our individual relationships with each of them. This precious knowledge has come to us in the</p>
<p>Restoration of the Gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Heavenly Father has made known what He is prepared to give His faithful children, subject to their faithfulness and faith in Him
and His Son. The restored truth regarding the Lord Jesus Christ, his atonement and how we can
access the atonement are absolutely crucial to our believing that the potential that Father granted
us is actually possible. How grateful we are for the Holy Ghost who writes upon our hearts
testimony of these truths. As we develop close relationships with our Father and the Savior, and
live the gospel daily, our confidence in our ability to achieve exaltation rises. How grateful I am
for a mission president who expanded my faith, my knowledge and my vision of eternal life. I
was a different young man when I returned from my mission. I knew more and my confidence
had increased. From Doctrine and Covenants 121:45, these reassuring words, <i>&#8220;let virtue garnish
thy thoughts unceasingly, then shall thy confidence was strong in the presence of God.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The third lesson I have learned is that reaching our potential must involve major challenges, and we should expect them. With clear vision of who we are, we must be sufficiently strong to confront and withstand each challenge, and there may be a series of them. Eternal life has a cost which is paid in doing all we can do to remain faithful in a world of testing. I can truthfully say
that I have learned a little from my successes, but I have learned far more from my failures and bruisings from numerous challenges. Each of us will have specially tailored challenges which probe not only our weaknesses, but also our faith our faith in the Lord, in the Restored Church</p>
<p>of Christ, and in ourselves. Perhaps we ought to adopt a personal Motto: &#8220;I shall not yield, whatever the challenge may be.&#8221; For a pattern of frequent yielding is like a cancer which grows unchecked until is consumes our faith and belief in God and in ourselves. It robs us of vision, leaving us with little prospects, and a diminished desire to pay the price for real temporal or
eternal achievement. What terrible costs for us who know the truth about ourselves and what we
can achieve. If we were to gain the whole world, but lose our souls, this is an unbelievably high
price when we could, through repentance and the gift of the Atonement of Christ, have achieved
so much more.</p>
<p>The fourth insight that has come to me is the need to keep the Gospel of Christ dominant, which
is His Way of Life, functioning in a steering or controlling capacity. We must learn to
subordinate the worldly culture to the truths of the Gospel of Christ. We have seen this almost
miraculous development in the lives of many individuals when they accept the gospel and a new
way of life. Our brothers and sisters from across the globe are coming into a knowledge of the
Restored Gospel and of themselves. You see it in lives and testimonies of converts in Romania,
in Hungary, in Poland and other hemispheres and lands. I do not have time to share with you
experiences where we have seen the culture of the Gospel of Jesus Christ take precedence over
the prevailing national or worldly culture. The Gospel truth liberates all men and women and
focuses them on a higher culture. They become <i>&#8220;no more strangers or foreigners, but fellow
citizens in the household of God,&#8221;</i> as Paul told the Ephesians (Ephesians 2:19). In our own land,
in a land favored above all others lands, and across the world, we now face a broadening culture
which is increasingly foreign to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. If we believe in ourselves and our
potential, we will not yield to this broadening world culture which lacks vision and is
increasingly self-indulgent, self-serving and hedonistic. The eternal virtues must be enthroned in
our lives and become our guiding stars. We must abhor dishonest conduct, the use of foul and
base language so much in vogue, waste time and become dulled by the tasteless array of various
entertainments, often falsely parading as true and acceptable reality. We must and will not yield
to sexual impurity in all of its forms, or yield to the siren song of endless pleasure and
materialism. Our destiny is to be transformed through the atonement of Christ into individuals
who receive eternal life within an eternal family where all that the Father has, He is willing to
give to His faithful Children.</p>
<p>Finally, it will also be important for us not only to adopt and defend the culture of the Gospel,
but also to school our personalities so that they are shaped, enlarged and changed into
personalities that are harmonious with the principles and teachings of the Lord. We will want to
look very hard at the oft used expression: &#8220;I am who I am,&#8221; or &#8220;you'll have to take me the way I
am.&#8221; We are all better than that. The seeds of Deity that are within us should constantly coax us
to reach for the best that is within us and be ready to give up traits that are not good, not
endearing or not harmonious with the Gospel. Just as gospel culture must take precedence over
worldly culture, our personalities must be shaped and altered by the truths of the Gospel.</p>
<p>These are just some of the important things I have learned over the years. I am yet learning and comprehending the unfolding picture of what constitutes eternal life. I am still challenged on
many fronts. But I revel in the knowledge of the Gospel and of the revelatory processes that are
so alive in the Church of Christ today. Our times are becoming even a greater test of our spiritual
strength, and they will become even more demanding. Thank the Lord for His living apostles and
prophets and the light they give in their leading.</p>
<p>In closing I wish to express my great love for all of you. Though we do not know one another
very well, that love is genuine. It is the love which I feel our Father has for me and you. I bear
witness that God our Father lives and has high hopes for His children. I testify of the Lord Jesus
Christ, that he lives and that He is the complete Redeemer for each of us. I testify that the Holy
Ghost is real and stands ready to confirm our belief and faith. I know that Joseph Smith is the
Prophet of the Restoration and that Gordon B. Hinckley is faithfully in the footsteps of a true
prophet.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Greetings, my dear brothers and sisters&#8212;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">To come to a college campus on a beautiful fall afternoon is an exhilarating experience at any
age, even at mine! We toured your campus briefly today and I compliment you on the wonderful
world you have all helped create here at BYU</span><font face="Times New Roman">â</font><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Idaho. I admire very much your exceptional
president, David Bednar, and his wife, Susan, and thank them for the key roles they play and for
their significant contributions to the university community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I honestly feel there is something about the spiritual climate here that is quite unique. I base my
feelings in part on the spiritual growth I have observed through the years in some members of
your faculty and staff who were associates of mine over 40 years ago in school and the mission
field. As I have encountered them periodically during the intervening years, I have always come
away with the feeling that their spiritual growth and maturity far exceeded my own. I hope you
all appreciate and are taking full advantage of the gift you have been given through your
admission here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, I always worry whether, at my age, I have anything of value to say to younger members of
the Church. My obsolescence was brought forcefully to my attention several years ago when our
oldest son was in high school. I noticed one morning he was in the vicinity of my clothes closet,
so at breakfast I gently inquired whether I owned anything he considered worthy of wearing.
&#8220;Relax, dad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;We&#8217;re having &#8216;Nerd Day&#8217; at school tomorrow!&#8221; I knew then my vintage
was on its way out!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have a message to share with you today and I pray that the Holy Ghost will carry it from my
heart to yours. I know that it&#8217;s only when our hearts change, that we really change.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">An Experience in Rochester</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">About ten years ago my wife and I and four of our eight children had the privilege of serving a
mission together in Rochester, New York. The New York Rochester Mission covers the area
where the Church was restored and includes the Sacred Grove, the Hill Cumorah, the Smith
Home and Farm, and the restored Whitmer Family Cabin in Fayette where the Church was
organized in 1830. It was a great place to serve and we used to tell our missionaries, &#8220;Your
mission is the mission all other missions testify of!&#8221; Sounds a bit prideful, doesn&#8217;t it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">One day, about a year into our mission, a caller telephoned the mission office asking to speak to
the mission president. I came on the line and a pleasant-sounding gentleman asked if I was the
mission president for the Church in the Rochester area. When I said I was, he introduced himself
and said he was calling as the chairman of a committee established by the Catholic Diocese in
Rochester to study and make recommendations concerning how young adult Catholics could be
strengthened in their faith and church activity. He said his committee had begun its work and had
discovered that by far the most religiously active young adults in the Rochester area were the
Latter-day Saints. He asked if I would appear before his committee and share our Church&#8217;s
program for young adults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, you can imagine what a request like this does to the pulse rate of any red-blooded mission
president! I immediately had visions of converting the members of that committee and then
advancing with our missionary army on the entire membership of the Rochester Diocese!
Keeping my composure and trying not to sound overly eager, I said I would do my best to help,
but wanted to think for a day or two about what I might profitably share with his committee.
Over the next few days, as I thought about what it is that produces committed, active young
single adults in the Church, I realized there wasn&#8217;t a single program or handbook I might share to
help our good Catholic neighbors with their challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In fact, as I thought about it, I realized that the climate for the spiritual growth of a person born
into this Church often begins even before birth when a loving mother and father are preparing for
the arrival of a new baby. The anticipation parents feel, the preparations they make, and the
prayers they offer for the healthy development and birth of a new baby help set the stage for
what will follow. Even the circumstances of a baby&#8217;s birth&#8212;being received and instantly loved
by grateful parents and often by adoring siblings and grandparents&#8212;must send vitally important
messages to a new baby&#8217;s soul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">But that&#8217;s just the beginning. Think about those initial days and nights when a new baby is
cuddled, rocked, fed, sung to and doted over. And, based on our own experience with our eight
children, every day at least a prayer or two for each child goes heavenward. Additional patterns
of gospel living begin to establish themselves as the child grows. The young child first observes
and then gradually begins to participate in family prayers and home evenings. Exasperated
parents may feel that on any given Monday evening they may have done more harm than good,
but even our family is evidence that the cumulative effect of 18 or 19 years of fairly ordinary
family home evenings can work wonders. At some point family scripture study plays a role.
And, even if a family specializes in only the first part of the Book of Mormon&#8212;as ours
has&#8212;there is much to be gained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">By the time a child is 18 months old, he or she qualifies to attend the nursery during Primary
time. This is a big step for the child and a big relief for the parents! Here a child feels the love
and influence of teachers outside its family, has opportunity to socialize with other children, and
broadens its knowledge of gospel teachings, often through music. In all the world is there
anything more stirring to one&#8217;s soul than to watch and listen to young boys and girls singing &#8220;I
am a Child of God?&#8221; I think not, especially if they are one&#8217;s own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">At age three a young member of our Church begins to attend Primary, attaining at long last the
elevated status of a Sunbeam. I know it may seem peculiar, but even in my advanced years I can
still remember the innocent joy and spiritual stirrings I felt as a young child in what was then
called Jr. Sunday School, enthusiastically singing with my peers, &#8220;Jesus Wants Me for a
Sunbeam!&#8221; A child progresses from a Sunbeam to several years of &#8220;Choosing the Right,&#8221; then to
being a Valiant and all too soon that special rite of passage&#8212;graduation from Primary&#8212;occurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">What an exciting moment it is at age 12 when a child becomes a Young Woman or Young Man.
The Personal Progress and Duty to God Programs give direction and spiritual substance to
impressionable minds and hearts. Just think of the wonder of a 12-year-old boy being entrusted
with a portion of God&#8217;s authority, the Aaronic Priesthood. During those important, formative
years from 12 to 18 every young man and young woman has numerous opportunities to speak,
teach, lead, sing, dance, play, serve, socialize, be taught, and even perform baptisms for the dead
in holy temples. In addition, four solid years of scripture study begin at age 14 in the seminary
programs of the Church. Usually, in the late teens, young people develop a desire to receive their
patriarchal blessings. What a thrill it is to have a patriarch bless us in God&#8217;s name and share
through inspiration the direction our life may take if we faithfully choose God&#8217;s ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Although I have described it only partially, this rich and well-defined path that children and
youth walk at home and in Church is inspired and designed to prepare our young men for the
oath and covenant of the Melchizedek Priesthood and both young men and women for the higher
ordinances of the temple, including eternal marriage. At 19 for young men and 21 for young
women, the possibility exists to serve a full-time mission. Can we even begin to measure what it
means in terms of spiritual growth for those involved and for the Church generally to have nearly
30,000 honorably-released missionaries returning home each year from missions? I believe there
is nothing quite like it in all the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I could go on, but suffice it to say, after a few days I called my Catholic friend back and said: &#8220;I
have something I can share with your committee, but I doubt you will want it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;Upon reflection, I have concluded that in order to have the faithful, active young
people you&#8217;re seeking, you&#8217;ll need to adopt Mormonism in its entirety.&#8221; He chuckled and said,
&#8220;That isn&#8217;t quite what I had in mind.&#8221; I told him I assumed that would be the case and we
amiably agreed to part company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My intent in telling this story is to convey to some small extent the deep feelings of affection and
appreciation I feel for the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and the Church that was organized to
administer it. I believe deeply in the Lord&#8217;s own declaration that The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints is <i>&#8220;. . . the only true and living Church upon the face of the whole earth with
which [the Lord is] well pleased,&#8221;</i> speaking, as He Himself added, <i>&#8220;unto the church collectively
and not individually&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants&#160;1:30). Obviously, none of us is perfect, but
God&#8217;s church and its teachings and the way of life it commends, are. 
		</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">The Pearl of Great Price</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The feelings I have about the inestimable worth of the gospel and the Church are captured in the
Savior&#8217;s parable of the Pearl of Great Price: <i>&#8220;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a
merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went
and sold all that he had, and bought it&#8221;</i> (Matthew 13:45-46). Pearls have always been highly
valued and prized. The merchant in this parable was seeking &#8220;goodly pearls.&#8221; When he found the
pearl that excelled all others, he &#8220;sold all he had&#8221; and bought the pearl of great price. Note well
that the price to be paid is one&#8217;s all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My desire today to testify of the great worth of the gospel and the Church is in part born out of
my fear that in this information age, with so much competing for your time and attention, and
with the world pressing in so mightily upon you, you will be tempted to minimize the unequaled
value of what you have been given and may unwittingly exchange it for something of far lesser
value. It would be a sad day indeed if what you lost during your college years was far more
important than what you gained.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Acres of Diamonds</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In the late eighteen and early nineteen hundreds, a Baptist minister by the name of
Russell&#160;Conwell traveled our country over giving a public lecture entitled &#8220;Acres of Diamonds.&#8221;
In fact, if you can imagine, he gave essentially the same talk, lasting an hour or more, over 6,000
times (his wife must have been as patient as mine)!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The essence of his classic talk is found in the legend of Ali Hafed, an ancient Persian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Ali, blessed with a farm and many orchards, was nevertheless discontented. He wished for
greater wealth. So he sought out the village priest and asked for guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The priest advised him to look for a river with white sands. There he would find
diamonds&#8212;many diamonds. So Ali left his family with neighbors, sold his farm, and went in
search of diamonds. For years Ali searched, never returning to his family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Ultimately, Ali walked into the ocean&#8217;s waves, willfully ending his life&#8212;penniless and broken in
spirit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">While Ali was searching for his great wealth, the new owner of Ali&#8217;s farm continued making it a
productive piece of land. One day, as his camels were drinking from the river that ran through
Ali&#8217;s property, he saw a strange rock. Pulling it out of the stream and examining it, he was in
awe. It was a very large diamond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">That farm became the site of the world&#8217;s largest diamond mine! Right there in Ali&#8217;s back yard
was the river with white sands the priest had spoken of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The obvious metaphorical point of Mr. Conwell&#8217;s lecture (and someone must have found it
useful if he gave it over 6,000 times for pay) is that it is often human nature to think there is
greater good &#8220;out there somewhere&#8221; than we are able to recognize close to home. Had Ali Hafed
remained at home and dug under his own cellar, or underneath his own wheatfields, or in his
own garden, he would have had &#8220;acres of diamonds&#8221; instead of wretchedness, starvation, and
death by suicide in a strange land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">With all the feeling I can muster, I beg of you young Latter-day Saints&#8212;as concerns your faith
and activity in the restored gospel and Church&#8212;please stay at home. The pearl of greatest price
is within your grasp. You need only to spend your days giving &#8220;your all&#8221; for it and in that
process you will gain <i>&#8220;peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and
Covenants 59:23).</span></p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Reasons to &#8220;Stay at Home&#8221; in the Gospel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I&#8217;d like now to share a few of the reasons (call them pearls or diamonds, if you wish), why I&#8217;ve
&#8220;stayed at home&#8221; in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I hope you will find them compelling and helpful
in your own efforts to &#8220;stay at home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">The Gospel Embraces All Truth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I begin with a story whose authenticity I verified just last week with Elder Henry B. Eyring. His
father, also named Henry, is renowned as a scientist and teacher, but once he was just a young
freshman boy leaving home to attend the University of Arizona. At that time his wise father
counseled him: &#8220;Henry, don&#8217;t worry about your faith. As a Latter-day Saint you don&#8217;t have to
believe anything that isn&#8217;t true.&#8221; That is a priceless bit of advice. It led to a personal philosophy
that guided Henry throughout life. When he encountered apparent conflicts between science and
his religion, he assumed he either didn&#8217;t know enough about the gospel or about the science and
he worked and waited for greater knowledge about both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I am grateful to have lived my life with the confidence that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Nevertheless, as the Apostle Paul taught,<i>
&#8220;we see now through a glass darkly,&#8221;</i> knowing much only in part (1&#160;Corinthians 13:12). But as
Paul assured the Corinthians, <i>&#8220;But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part
shall be done away&#8221; </i>(1 Corinthians 13:10). I have this same assurance. Whenever questions are
raised about the DNA of the Book of Mormon peoples, or some obscure point of Church history,
or the age of the earth, or the Church&#8217;s position on same gender marriage, or any of the other
issues that sometimes perplex members of the Church, I quietly take Paul&#8217;s teachings to heart. I
know that when the full truth is known (and I know that day will come), it will be consistent with
and completely vindicate the doctrines and teachings of this Church. The Prophet Joseph coined
his own &#8220;diamond&#8221; metaphor on this very point. Said he:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>I combat the errors of ages; I meet the violence of mobs; I cope with illegal
proceedings from executive authority; I cut the Gordian knot of powers; and I
solve mathematical problems of Universities: <span style="font-weight: bold">WITH TRUTH, diamond truth</span>,
and God is my &#8216;right hand man&#8217;</i> (Joseph Smith to James Arlington Bennet, 13
November 1843, Nauvoo, Illinois, Joseph Smith, Papers, Correspondence, LDS
Church Archives, emphasis added).</span></p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">The Gospel is Inclusive</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Something else I hold very dear about the gospel is its &#8220;inclusive&#8221; nature. I am told someone
once asked Carl Sandburg what the ugliest word in the English language was. He reportedly said
he thought it was the word &#8220;exclusive.&#8221; The inclusive spirit of the gospel begins for me with our
Heavenly Father&#8217;s offer to share with us all that He has (Doctrine and Covenants 84:38; 76:59),
on condition that we give Him all we have. We sometimes speak of &#8220;sacrificing&#8221; for the good of
God&#8217;s kingdom, but how can it be termed a sacrifice when we, during our brief lifetimes, offer
up what amounts to a few handfuls of alms and what we are promised in return is &#8220;worlds
without number&#8221; forever?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The gospel&#8217;s inclusiveness is reflected in another wonderful way. In a revelation explaining why
the gospel was restored in these latter days, the Lord gave as one reason that 
		<i>&#8220;every man might
speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants
1:20). Our family has just completed a three-year assignment in Europe. There, most religions
congregations are presided over by a single individual who does almost all of the praying,
preaching and teaching, and ministers to the needs of all. There is very little participation by
others and consequently very little growth. By contrast, Latter-day Saints are all included in the
work of the Lord. &#8220;Every man [speaking generically] speaks in the name of God the Lord&#8221; and
can experience the personal growth and development that comes from participating in a variety
of Church callings and activities over a lifetime. A Heavenly Father who desires to give us all
that He has certainly wants us to prepare for that moment by becoming all that He is. He knows
what it takes to grow to that stature and has organized His Church to help us achieve it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I think President Hinckley recently captured the essence of this idea as he received the
Presidential Medal of Freedom. In expressing his appreciation before receiving the award from
President George W. Bush, he said: <i>&#8220;I am profoundly grateful. In a larger sense, it recognizes
and honors the Church, which has given me so many opportunities and whose interest I have
tried to serve&#8221; </i>(<i>Ensign</i>, September 2004, 75).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Such an inclusive system, by the way, isn&#8217;t without risks. Occasionally, the ward organist will
hit a clinker, a Sunday school teacher may share some questionable doctrine, or a bishop may
make a procedural error. Thankfully, since the rest of us are also just laymen and are
&#8220;practicing&#8221; in our own roles, we will be patient and understanding of such shortcomings!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I think this notion of being included is subtly manifest in the way the priesthood is conferred. At
age 12 a young man is given the Aaronic Priesthood, part of God&#8217;s authority, often by his father.
The father then spends the next six years praying and working for the day when his son will be
worthy to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, which is all the priesthood he can be given. There
is no more. At that point, father and son are equals and only their priesthood offices may
distinguish them. The noteworthy thing&#8212;from my point of view&#8212;is that the priesthood &#8220;haves&#8221;
want to include the priesthood &#8220;have-nots.&#8221; There is no withholding of authority, no conferral of
it upon an exclusive few, no desire to create an aristocracy of priesthood leadership in God&#8217;s
Church. The Lord Himself has declared that <i>&#8220;the [Church] hath need of every member, that all
may be edified together, that the system may be kept perfect&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 84:110).</span></p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">Eternal Marriage and Family Life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Another precious aspect of the gospel is its concept of eternal marriage and family life. Those of
us who grow up knowing of these doctrines tend to be quite matter-of-fact about them. Those,
however, who join the Church and first hear of these doctrines as adults are often stunned by
them and their implications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">One of the choicest associations of our time in Europe was with Helmi Luschin, the 78-year-old
widow of Emmo Luschin. Emmo was for over 40 years the Church&#8217;s lead German translator. He
was a brilliant linguist and a strong-willed and wonderful man. He and his beloved Helmi met
after the Second World War. Since both were interested in learning English, they courted by
writing each other a letter in English each day and coming together after work in the evenings to
read Shakespeare. (I can&#8217;t resist asking you to consider how the level of this approach compares
with the &#8220;hanging-out-together&#8221; syndrome so characteristic of current dating culture!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Helmi told us that shortly after she and Emmo were married in the Catholic Church, he said to
her one day: &#8220;We&#8217;ll be together in heaven.&#8221; &#8220;Well,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of that.&#8221; He
then said: &#8220;If they don&#8217;t have it when we get there, they&#8217;ll invent it for us!&#8221; A few years later the
full-time missionaries knocked on the Luschin&#8217;s door in Gratz, Austria. Brother Luschin&#8217;s first
question was, &#8220;What does your Church teach about marriage and family?&#8221; The rest, as they say,
is history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I know, as do the Luschin&#8217;s, that love, like life, is eternal. I know that the deepest joys and
sometimes the greatest sorrows of this life are experienced in the setting of marriage and family.
I know that this setting was divinely appointed as a necessary laboratory in which we can acquire
the attributes eventually to become like God. My wife and family are pearls of great price to me.
I hope to be worthy to possess them forever.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold; font-family:Times New Roman, serif; font-size:12pt">The Gift of the Holy Ghost</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I turn now to something else I highly value about the restored gospel. It&#8217;s the fact that this
Church has the authority to confer upon each of us, following our baptism, the gift of the Holy
Ghost. When the Nephite Twelve prayed for that which they most desired, the scripture says, 
		<i>&#8220;. .
. and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them&#8221;</i> (3 Nephi 19:9). I know all
who take their covenants seriously have that same desire. An experience I had one day
interviewing a missionary during a mission tour confirms that truth. I had talked with the fine
young elder for 10 or 15 minutes, asking him a series of questions about mission life and the
experience he was having. When I was about finished, I asked him if he wanted to ask me any
questions. He became very serious and said, &#8220;Brother Jensen, as we&#8217;ve talked together today and
as I&#8217;ve answered your questions, have you felt the Spirit of the Lord? Do I have the Spirit?&#8221; I
think in all my years of interviewing Latter-day Saints I&#8217;ve never had a better question posed to
me. It told me volumes about that young elder and the deepest desires of his heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Interestingly, as we had talked together, I had received the distinct impression that this was a
very genuine and good young man, and so I could honestly say to him that I had felt the Spirit. I
could tell it was important for him to be reassured and I told him about the group of Lamanites
who the Book of Mormon says <i>&#8220;. . . were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they
knew it not&#8221; </i>(3 Nephi 9:20).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I want to assure all of you today that through proper priesthood authority this Church can validly
confer upon us the Gift of the Holy Ghost. If we live worthily, we will be guided by that Spirit
and be entitled to the comfort and spiritual gifts that it brings, including a firm testimony of the
truth of the gospel. This will be the case even if we sometimes have doubts about our own
spirituality and like the Lamanites, occasionally feel the Spirit and &#8220;know it not.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I hope you are beginning to understand how much I value the restored gospel and why I have
&#8220;stayed at home&#8221; in it. The gospel is so deep, so wide, so all-encompassing that figuratively
speaking, I have today barely scratched the surface of Ali Hafed&#8217;s diamond mine. If time
permitted, I would love to speak of the redemption of the dead, of agency, of Church history, of
the unmatched canon of scripture the Church possesses, and of the teachings of living Prophets
and Apostles. These and many others, are all additional pearls I prize. But I am constrained due
to a recent conversation with my wife. After hearing me speak one Sunday morning, she asked,
&#8220;Whatever happened to those good, short talks you used to give?&#8221; I told her I was older now and
knew more, and felt compelled to share that knowledge on every occasion. Looking me straight
in the eye she said, &#8220;Well, don&#8217;t!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Taking the counsel of my best peer reviewer seriously, I&#8217;ll close with mention of the greatest
pearl of all. The Prophet Joseph described it as succinctly and powerfully as it can be done. In
answer to the question, &#8220;What are the fundamental principles of your religion? He said, 
		<i>&#8220;The
fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets,
concerning Jesus Christ, that he died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended
into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it&#8221;
		</i>(<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, 121).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I am grateful beyond words to belong to a Church that is Christ-centered in its doctrines and
practices. He is the substance of our scriptures, our temples, and hopefully our homes and our
hearts. I know He is the light, life, and hope of our world and that no one will come to the Father
but by Him. Aided by the restoration scriptures, our understanding of the Atonement is clear. We
know what He has done for us and what we must do. We are free to repent and prepare for the
day when He who was the Beginning will also be the End.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, I know a talk like this should do more than just inform and entertain. It should also move
us to apply its content in our lives. What would I have us do as a result of our time together
today? Very simply, I hope we will all &#8220;stay at home&#8221; in the gospel, recognize and treasure it as
the Pearl of Great Price it is, honestly live it to the best of our ability, and humbly share it with
others. To that end I pray for us all. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>

<p>I have a son who is a very deep sleeper. When he was little, he would talk in his sleep. His
brothers and sister loved having conversations with him while he was asleep and even
recorded some of them to prove to him that they really happened. He would also walk in his
sleep, which was rather frightening and very dangerous. In the middle of one winter night our
next-door neighbors heard a child crying outside. They looked out and saw our little boy
lying in the street in freezing weather in his pajamas. They picked him up and brought him
into our house and put him in the nearest empty bed. When they called and told us about it
the next day, we were horrified, as well as exceedingly grateful since they had clearly saved
his life. As he grew into his teenage years, it became increasingly difficult to get him up in
the mornings. We would call and coax, play loud music, jump on his bed, and bribe with
wonderful-smelling breakfasts. When he left on his mission he took three alarm clocks with
him and wrote to us that he had instructed his companions to set the alarm clocks and then
hide them from him each night so he would be able to wake up the next morning.</p>
<p>Of course, none of you students has ever slept through an alarm, right? Certainly, you have
never slept through a class here at BYU-Idaho &#8211; you might miss something crucial.
Although, I have heard of teachers who occasionally feel the need to check for vital signs in
their classes.</p>
<p>It seems that the Lord must also go to great lengths to wake us up and save our eternal lives.
It&#8217;s amazing how frequently the scriptures use this metaphor suggesting that we, in the
mortal, natural man state are spiritually asleep and very difficult to awaken to God&#8217;s saving
realities. Nephi is keenly aware of this principle, and in 2 Nephi 4:28 he cries, 
		<i>&#8220;Awake, my
soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of
my soul.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Please turn with me to 2 Nephi chapter 1. Starting with verse 13, Lehi pleads with his sons:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>O that ye would awake; awake from a deep sleep, yea, even from the sleep of
hell, and shake off the awful chains by which ye are bound, which are the
chains which bind the children of men, that they are carried away captive
down to the eternal gulf of misery and woe.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Awake! and arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling parent
whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent grave&#8230;</i>(2 Nephi
1:13-14) </p>
<p>Now skip to verse 23:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with
which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust.</i></p>
<p>In Jacob 3:11, as he teaches the people at the temple about materialism, pride, and
immorality, (which are, incidentally, the three big temptations of our time as well ) Jacob
exhorts:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>O my brethren, hearken unto my words; arouse the faculties of your souls;
shake yourselves that ye may awake from the slumber of death; and loose
yourselves from the pains of hell that ye may not become angels to the devil, to
be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone which is the second death.</i></p>
<p>King Benjamin, Alma, Mormon, Isaiah, Paul and others warn their people and us to awaken
from an &#8220;endless sleep&#8221; (Mormon 9:13) to a sense of our utter dependence on the Lord
(Mosiah 4:5);<i> &#8220;to awaken [from] a lively sense of our guilt&#8221;</i> (Mosiah 2:38) to righteousness</p>
<p>(I Corinthians 15:34); and to awaken to a remembrance of our duty to God (Alma 4:3, Alma
7:22). (See also Isaiah 51:9 and Romans 13:9)</p>
<p>Modern servants of God plead with us to &#8220;wake up&#8221; with the same intensity. Listen to
President David O. McKay:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>With all our boasted civilization, there never was a time when spiritual
awakening and spiritual ideals were more needed. Mankind needs a spiritual
awakening, brothers and sisters; the carnal minded are causing heartaches
and threatening the extinction of the race . . . My faith in the ultimate triumph
of the gospel of Jesus Christ assures me that a spiritual awakening must come.
It will come through the acceptance of Jesus Christ and obedience to the
gospel</i> (&#8220;Spiritual Awakening.&#8221;

<p>Elder Melvin Hammond tells the story of camping with his young son, who in the darkness of
the night felt a little insecure and asked, &#8220;Dad, are you awake?&#8221; Our families and loved ones,
Elder Hammond teaches, need to know that we are awake <i>&#8220;to the things that are most
important;&#8221; </i>the eternal realities of keeping God&#8217;s commandments, crucial family
relationships, and sacred covenants (&#8220;Dad, Are You Awake?&#8221; 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>. Nov. 2002: 97-98.)</p>
<p>It is as if these servants of God ancient and modern are begging us, &#8220;Come on.&#8221; &#8220;Wake up!&#8221;
&#8220;You don&#8217;t get it!&#8221; &#8220;Hello!&#8221; &#8220;Can you hear me now?&#8221; &#8220;If ya snooze, ya lose.&#8221; They want us
to see things as they really are, as Jacob teaches in Jacob 4:13: <i>&#8220;. . . for the Spirit speaketh
the truth and lieth not </i>[unlike the enemy of our soul] <i>Wherfore, it speaketh of things as they
really are, and of things as they really will be.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;In the end,&#8221;</i>says Elder Neal Maxwell, <i>&#8220;we will have either chosen to act in accord with
things as they really are &#8211;or we will have opted for the fleeting things of this world. And this
is a dying world&#8221;</i> (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Things as They Really Are.</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1978:18).

<p>Do you remember the movie, <i>The Truman Show</i>? It&#8217;s about a character who is placed in a
fake world where every element of his environment is controlled from the time he&#8217;s born for
the sole purpose of having an interesting TV show. It&#8217;s like a soap opera, only with a real
person&#8217;s life, but Truman doesn&#8217;t know it. At the end he finds the exit sign on the elaborately
designed set, realizes his world is not the real world, and escapes.</p>
<p>Could it be, brothers and sisters, that many of us are putting stock in the vain imaginations of
an unreal world? Are we sleep-walking our way through our one chance at mortality, not
realizing that we are drowsily following popular values, behaviors, fashions, attitudes, and
opinions of those who never trusted or believed in God or in what President Spencer W.

<p>A few years ago around Christmas time, I was standing in line at the grocery store and saw a
		<i>Time</i> magazine cover that said something like &#8220;Jesus Christ; Son of God or Great Teacher?&#8221; I
read the article and was hurt to hear so many people, even professed Christians and religious
leaders, say that he was merely a great teacher. Some recent best-selling novels base their
whole story on this same premise. C. S. Lewis contends that this is a lot of <i>rubbish</i>:</p>

must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a
madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at
Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord
and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a

<p>There are many forces at work which delight to &#8220;lullaby&#8221; us away, keep us deeply and
ignorantly asleep, and obscure our vision of things as they really are. In his eighteenth
century masterpiece <i>The Dunciad</i>, Alexander Pope writes of the Great Goddess Dullness who
prevents inspiration and keeps her subjects from light and truth predominantly through the
words and writings of base minds. Nor is she content with dull and sleeping subjects, but
forces evil and filth about them to keep them captive:</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t have to look very far to see that the great Goddess Dullness is alive and well today.
Much of our popular culture, diffused by the entertainment industry and the media, appears to
worship at her feet. Some reality TV programs for example, portray reality all right
&#8211;Dullness&#8217;s reality in a striking parade of immorality and greed. David Nyhan, a columnist
and associate editor for the Boston Globe, decries TV as <i>&#8220;an open sewer coursing through
our homes [that has] caused an alarming deadening of moral sensitivity&#8221;</i> (qtd. in Rodney
Keller. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Aims and Options</span>. 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999.). Unfortunately,
consumers don&#8217;t see labels on all media like are found on prescription drugs. Some definitely
should say, &#8220;Warning: may cause spiritual drowsiness!&#8221; Elder M. Russell Ballard adds his

<p>Embracing these abominations enslaves us to the Goddess Dullness and the master of
darkness whom she serves, puts us to spiritual sleep, and causes our souls to droop in sin and
ignorance of absolute truths.</p>
<p>Nothing is weightier than the burden of sin (Jeffrey R. Holland. 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Trusting Jesus</span>. Salt Lake
City: Deseret Book, 2003:65). Nothing robs us of reason to rejoice more than breaking God&#8217;s
absolute laws. We are mortal and by virtue of our fallen nature we have the predisposition to
sin. Not many of us, last time I looked, are on a list of people to be translated. How dare we
be so human? How dare we make mistakes? Making mistakes is, however, part of our mortal
experience. But we need not continue in sin and error (JST 1 John 3:9). One of the
breathtakingly beautiful realities of the gospel of Jesus Christ is the gift of repentance. In the
Hebrew of the<i> Old Testament </i>the word for repentance is <i>shube, </i>which means to turn. We turn
our hearts to God and present him with our wills, which Elder Maxwell assures us is the only
thing we really have to give him which is not already his (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Things as They Really Are.</span> Salt
Lake City: Deseret Book, 1978:18).</p>
<p>In the Greek of the <i>New Testament </i>the word for repentance, <i>metaneoeo, &#8220;denotes a change of
mind, i..e, a fresh view about God, about oneself, and about the world&#8221;</i> (Theodore M.
Burton. &#8220;The Meaning of Repentance.&#8221; 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span> Aug. 1988: 5-9:1,2; see also 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">LDS Bible
Dictionary</span>. Salt Lake City: Intellectual Reserve, 1998:760). When we repent, we adopt a new
point of view, God&#8217;s point of view; we see things as they really are. We abhor the sins that
offend God (Alma 13:12) and bury them just as the Anti-Nephi-Lehis buried their weapons
(Alma 24:17). We also focus on turning away from the other daily weaknesses of the flesh
such as pride, ego, pettiness, anger, jealousy, revenge, bitterness and all our other emotions
that come to us by means of our fallen state. We turn away from the attractions of an unreal,
fallen world and adopt God&#8217;s way of thinking, His way of feeling and His way of loving.</p>
<p>When the spirit prompts us and we make this turn, when we finally &#8220;get it,&#8221; we can do
tremendous good. Sister Sherri Dew, who does much good, relates how a young lady came
up to her after a talk and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet when you get up every morning the devil says to
himself, &#8216;Oh no! She&#8217;s awake again!&#8217;&#8221; (<span style="text-decoration: underline">God Wants a Powerful People</span>. Compact Disc. Salt
Lake City: Deseret Book, 2004). But we need to watch out! The devil, in league with
Dullness and her minions, will do all that he can to tempt us to push the snooze button and
roll back over in lazy creature comfort. This is exceedingly dangerous since if we give in, if
we don&#8217;t repent &#8211; just as when we sleep in class &#8211; we may miss out on something crucial.</p>
<p>There is a perfect example of this lost opportunity in C.S. Lewis&#8217;s 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Chronicles of Narnia</span>,
in the book called <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Last Battle</span>. A group of dwarves who have been self-centered and
nasty throughout the whole story are in a heavenly place that is surrounded by beautiful sky
and trees and flowers. Their mind-set, however, remains as always, negative and clouded,
and they think they are trapped in a dark, filthy little stable where someone is trying to get the
better of them. <i>&#8220;The dwarves are for the dwarves,&#8221;</i> they yell out in typical, belligerent
fashion. The Christ figure in the series, Aslan, provides them with a marvelous feast, 
		<i>&#8220;but
they think they are eating only the kinds of things you might find in a stable&#8221; 
		</i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Last
Battle</span>. New York: Scholastic Inc. 1956:168,169). He gives them veritable manna, and they
take it for dung. Because of their dark, limited little minds, they will not be helped, they
refuse communication with heavenly beings, and consequently, they miss out on so much;
they miss out on heaven!</p>
<p>What is it, brothers and sisters that we are missing out on when we do not allow the spirit to
teach us absolute truths or help us understand things as they really are, or when we refuse to
adopt God&#8217;s view? Could it be that, when in our dark, little stables of mortal drowsiness and
ignorance, we risk missing out on the greatest of all the gifts of God?</p>
<p>Elder Orson F. Whitney tells about how he almost missed out. When he was a young, yet
unconverted missionary, he was being enticed by the vain imaginations of the world. He was
more interested in writing for newspapers than studying and preaching the gospel. One night,
he had a dream that he was in the garden of Gethsemane standing behind a tree and
witnessing the Savior&#8217;s pain and agony. Elder Whitney was heartbroken as he watched the
tears stream down the Savior&#8217;s face. He recounts, &#8220;My whole heart went out to Him. I loved
Him with all my soul and longed to be with Him as I longed for nothing else.&#8221; He watched
the Savior walk to where the apostles Peter, James, and John waited -- fast asleep! The Savior
shook them gently, awoke them, and without any anger or unkindness asked them if they
could not watch with Him one hour. &#8220;There He was,&#8221; continues Elder Whitney, &#8220;with the
weight of the world&#8217;s sin upon His shoulders, with the pangs of every man, woman and child
shooting through His sensitive soul &#8211; and they could not watch with Him one hour!&#8221; Elder
Whitney listened as the Lord admonished, &#8220;<i>Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation:
the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak</i>&#8221; (Matthew 26:41).</p>
<p>Suddenly the circumstances in the dream changed. The apostles were about to ascend into
heaven with the Savior. Elder Whitney could stand it no longer. He ran out from behind the
tree and fell at the Savior&#8217;s feet and begged to go with them. &#8220;&#8216;No my son; these have
finished their work, and they may go with me, but you must stay and finish yours.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, promise me that I will come to you at the last.&#8217;&#8221; [The Savior] smiled sweetly and
tenderly and replied, &#8220;&#8216;That will depend entirely upon yourself.&#8217;&#8221; Elder Whitney then awoke
with a sob in his throat. He vowed after that experience never to be found &#8220;asleep at his post&#8221;
again, losing the chance to do his duty to God, magnify a calling or accomplish
righteousness. Think about it. He would have missed out on being an apostle of the Lord and
ultimately on the chance to ascend with the Savior (Orson F. Whitney.&#8220;The Divinity of Jesus
Christ.&#8221; <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>. Dec. 2003: 6-11. 10, 11).</p>
<p>This picture by Pierro della Francesco is called<i> Resurrection</i>. Again we have the central act
in all human history, yet the guards are sleeping through it! Here, then, is the question for the
day: Will we embrace the reality of the atonement or will we sleep through it (Vaughn
Stephenson. Remarks in Gospel Doctrine class. Rexburg. 1998)? Will we allow the
unrepented and unhealed weaknesses of the flesh to cause us to miss out? President James E.
Faust makes this very strong statement, <i>&#8220;Our salvation depends on believing in and
accepting the Atonement. Such acceptance requires a continual effort to understand it more
fully&#8221; </i>(&#8220;The Atonement, Our Greatest Hope.&#8221; 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span> Nov. 2001: 18-20). Will we forfeit the
enabling, healing power of the atonement in this life and the exalting, glorifying power of the
atonement in the next life? As the Savior answered Elder Whitney, that depends entirely
upon you.</p>
<p>Sister Elaine Sorensen, Dean of the College of Nursing at BYU, explains that
		<i>&#8220;healing is
active. It requires all the energy of your entire being. You have to be there fully awake,
aware, and participating when it happens.&#8221; </i>She goes on to explain that spiritual healing
requires similar, active participation. It takes us and the Lord working together to orchestrate
the miracle. She continues, <i>&#8220;We 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">can</span> partake of the healing medicine of the Atonement of our
Savior who promised, &#8216;I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will heal
thee&#8217;</i>&#8221; (2 Kings 20:5, as quoted in &#8220;Learning the Healer&#8217;s Art.&#8221; 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">BYU Magazine</span>. Spring 2003:
50-55.; emphasis added). But, it does depend entirely upon us.</p>
<p>This picture is <span style="text-decoration: underline">Christ the Consolator
		</span>by Carl Heinrich Bloch. The word &#8220;consolator&#8221; comes
from Latin and then through the thirteenth century French word, <i>consolateur,</i> which means
the one who gives intense soothing (&#8220;Consolator.&#8221;
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Chambers Dictionary of Etymology</span>. New
York: H.W. Wilson Co., 1988:210). The painting depicts people of all ages and walks of life
who have come to the Lord. I love how relieved they look. They have come wounded and
heavy laden. They are now &#8220;intensely soothed&#8221; and healed of their burdens through the grace
of His love. We, too, can come to Christ the Healer, Christ the Consolator, but we must be
awake and aware of things as they really are. We must actively want to be healed. We must
desire to come unto the Savior with a broken heart and a contrite spirit (3 Nephi 12:19). Do
you remember the lawyer Zeezrom in<i> The Book of Mormon </i>who lay sick at Sidom with a
burning fever? <i>&#8220;&#8230;his mind was exceedingly sore because of his iniquities&#8221;</i> after hearing the
word of God. And when he saw Alma and Amulek, <i>&#8220;he stretched forth his hand, and
besought them that they would heal him. . . . Alma said unto him: Believest thou in the power
of Christ unto salvation . . .? If thou believest in the redemption of Christ thou canst be
healed&#8221; </i>(Alma 15:3-8).</p>
<p>The woman who was plagued with an issue of blood for twelve years is another stunning
example of someone who believed in the power of Christ and merely had to reach out and
touch the hem of the Savior&#8217;s garment in order to be made perfectly whole at last (see Mark
5:25-29).</p>
<p>In 3 Nephi 9:13 the Lord says to the righteous who were spared, <i>&#8220;will ye not now return unto
me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?&#8221;</i> He requires our
permission and our participation in our own healing; we have to be awake enough to believe
in it, awake enough to ask for it, or awake enough to reach out and obtain it.</p>
<p>Nephi agonizes in 2 Nephi 4:17-19:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my
soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: -2in; margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -2in; margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2in"><i>
<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and sins which do so
easily beset me.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And when I desire to rejoice my heart groaneth because of my sins;
nevertheless </i>[and here is the key]<i> I know in whom I have trusted.</i></p>
<p>Nephi understands God&#8217;s reality, knows from whence true healing comes, and knows that his
soul needs no longer droop in sin or discouragement, all because of the atonement of the
great Consolator. In verse 35 he says, <i>&#8220;Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that
asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss: therefore I will lift up my voice unto
thee; Yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>One of the temptations that may have so easily beset Nephi was the temptation to lose hope
in the face of his many trials. Is it possible that despair and hopelessness are another kind of
sin since they deny the enabling power of the atonement? But Nephi believed what his father,
Lehi, had taught his brother in 2 Nephi 2:2: <i>&#8220;Nevertheless, Jacob, &#8230;thou knowest the
greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Sometimes our afflictions, brothers and sisters, are like wake-up calls that get us to focus on
things as they really are. When we have nowhere else to turn, we turn to the Lord, who then
can enable us, bear us up and heal us as we experience the growing pains and wounds of
mortality. C.S. Lewis exclaims that &#8220;God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks to us in our
conscience, but shouts to us in our pain&#8221; (<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Problem of Pain</span>. New York: Touchstone,
1996:83).</p>
<p>Years ago, Sister Chieko Okasaki came to Ricks College as a devotional speaker. During the
luncheon before the devotional she shared with us how in her life she had learned to place her
afflictions on the altar of God and consecrate them to His service. For example, she said that
things were difficult during World War II. She agonized over the treatment of her people, but
decided to ask the Lord how she could turn over this pain to His will. The Lord taught her to
use her ethnic background to teach the sisters of the church about the beauty of our diversity
in a world-wide church, which she has done so well in her writings and her calling in the
general Relief Society. She also had a very difficult time when she lost her husband, Ed.
They were very much in love and very close, but instead of remaining alone in her grief, she
began to visit other widows in her area to bring them comfort and understanding. Sister
Okasaki was able to awake to the healing reality of the atonement in her life and allow the
Lord to consecrate her afflictions, not only for her gain, but also for a great blessing in the
lives of His other children (Letter to Christine Geddes. July, 2004).</p>
<p>Exercising Christ-like love for others is another absolute truth. As covenant members of the
Lord&#8217;s kingdom, and as part of our duty to God, we are under the sacred obligation to lift and
help one another. Elder Jeffrey Holland puts it this way, <i>&#8220;The church is not a monastery for
the isolation of perfect people. It is more like a hospital provided for those who wish to get
well.&#8221;</i> He says that if we truly wish to come unto the Savior to be healed ourselves, if we
truly wish to become like Him, then we need to feel after the pain of our brothers and sisters
and <i>&#8220;comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are
comforted of God&#8221;</i> (Trusting Jesus. Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2003: 66,67). Plus, once
we are awake to his healing kindness to us, we strongly desire to return the same gentleness
to each other.</p>
<p>During our 12 years in Hawaii we learned so much from those wonderful Polynesian people.
The analogy of how to catch sand crabs stands out in my mind. It&#8217;s so easy. You just dig a
hole in the sand and stick a bucket in the hole. You put some bait in the bucket, then you
watch as a little, unwary sand crab comes walking along and falls in. Pretty soon another and
another do the same until before you know it, you have a full bucket. You don&#8217;t even have to
put a lid on the bucket because as soon as a crab starts to crawl out, another one jumps on
him. Then if a crab on the other side tries to escape, two more come along and pull on his
legs so he cannot get out. So when people are acting unkind, back-biting, being jealous,
exclusive, judgmental, or tempting one another to break God&#8217;s absolute laws, the Polynesians
say they are acting like crabs in a bucket. They will not let one another ascend.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve noticed, life can be challenging; mortality can be painful. But why make
it harder for each other? Why pull each other down? Why not accept Elder Holland&#8217;s
apostolic charge? As he spoke to BYU students he said,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I ask you to be a healer, be a helper, be someone who joins in the work of
Christ in lifting burdens, in making the load lighter, in making things better.
Someone sitting within reasonable proximity to you </i>[today]<i> is carrying a
spiritual or physical or emotional burden of some sort or some other affliction
drawn from life&#8217;s catalogue of a thousand kinds of sorrows. </i>(70)</p>
<p>In the spirit of Elder Holland&#8217;s challenge, may I , in turn, invite us today to not be like the
crabs in the bucket, but to wake up to the work of the Great Physician and do what He does
best &#8211; lift, strengthen, and succor those around us (see Alma 7:11).</p>
<p>Another very potent medicine available to us is the word of God which has an amazing
power to <i>&#8220;awake and arouse our faculties&#8221;</i> (Alma 32:27). It invites the spirit into our lives,
entices us to turn and adopt God&#8217;s view, and brings us to the Christ. Unlike the words
inspired by the Great Goddess Dullness that anesthetize and paralyze, the pleasing word of
God invigorates the spirit and <i>&#8220;healeth the wounded soul&#8221;</i> (Jacob 2:8). Alma the Elder&#8217;s
people at the waters of Mormon were healed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold </i>[the Spirit] 
		<i>changed their hearts; yea he awakened them out of a deep
sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness;
nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word
		</i>(Alma 5:7).</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson expounds on this verse stating, <i>&#8220;We need to use the everlasting
word to awaken those in deep sleep so they will awake unto God&#8221; </i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">A Witness and a Warning.</span>
Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1988:320).</p>
<p>Let me tell you about two students I had here at BYU-Idaho. One young man came to our
campus with a rather negative attitude. He had a dark countenance. He was critical of his
teachers and vocally abusive to his peers. He was having trouble with his roommates and
trouble with his grades. He told me that he wasn&#8217;t happy with his life and wrote on an
assignment that he was deeply involved in sin. I hoped that with priesthood counsel and
sincere study of the scriptures he would find consolation. Unfortunately, he refused help and
would not turn to the Lord. He would not make the necessary effort to experiment upon the
word. He left here spiritually asleep and still very much unhealed.</p>
<p>Contrast this with a young lady who was also troubled. The Goddess Dullness had deceived
her and she had broken God&#8217;s absolute law of chastity. When she read the very verse about
the power of the pleasing word of God to heal the wounded soul, she opened her heart and
mind to the word and began taking her study of the Book of Mormon very seriously. She had
an awakening experience and began to apply the atonement to her personal situation. She
took the necessary steps and went to her bishop. She made a 180-degree turn and shared with
me that she was making great changes in her life and was so grateful for the healing that was
taking place. Her soul was awakened; it no longer drooped in sin. Her heart rejoiced in the
amazing gift of repentance and the fact that she could adopt God&#8217;s view and no longer feel
shame before Him. She knew that the last part of Moroni 7:48 applied now to her, too:<i>
&#8220;&#8230;when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he [really] is; that we
may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>How poignant are the last words of our beloved Elder Maxwell, as he must have known his
time with us was limited. Of all the realities he could have reemphasized, he chose to leave
written indelibly in our hearts and minds the absolute truth and reality of God&#8217;s love for each
of us. Savor with me the tender message he shared from this very pulpit last spring, as well as
in the Priesthood session of General Conference:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I testify to you that God has known you individually&#8230;for a long time (see
Doctrine and Covenants 93:23). He has loved you for a long, long time. He
not only knows the names of all the stars (see Psalm 147:4; Isaiah 40:26); He
knows your names and all your heartaches and your joys! By the way, you
have never seen an immortal star; they finally expire. But seated by you</i>
[today]<i> are immortal individuals &#8211; imperfect but who are, nevertheless, &#8216;trying
to be like Jesus!&#8217;</i> (&#8220;Remember How Merciful the Lord Hath Been.&#8221; 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>,
May 2004: 44- 46.)</p>
<p>How blessed we are to have been taught at the feet of one who knew and exemplified the
absolute truth of God&#8217;s love.</p>
<p>The prophet Moroni concludes his message with these words in Moroni 10:30-31:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ and lay hold
upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy
beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge
thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be confounded, that the
covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of
Israel, may be fulfilled.</i></p>
<p>The bottom line to all of this is quite simply, &#8220;if ya snooze, ya lose!&#8221; If you sleep walk and lie
down in the freezing roadway of sin, the vital warmth of your spirituality will soon ebb away,
and you may never again awake&#8211; to the bright and beautiful rays of the Eternal Son. On the
other hand, if you wake up unto Christ, all that the Lord has is yours. But once again, as the
Lord said to that young Orson F. Whitney when he was about your age, <i>it all depends on you.</i></p>
<p>My sweet young brothers and sisters, I would like to add my fervent testimony today that
Jesus Christ really is who He says He is. His work can and does accomplish what He
promises. You and I may become glorified, exalted, radiantly beautiful, powerful, and joyous
beings like He is if we will but awaken our souls to His atoning reality, remember our duty to
God, and shun the Goddess Dullness in all her many forms so that our souls will no longer
droop in sin or discouragement or sleepy ignorance. I believe with all my heart that because
of His unfathomable love, we may come unto Him and be healed by His pleasing word and
by participating in his work and glory to love and heal His family, our precious brothers and
sisters. Then will our hearts rejoice and with the psalmist we shall sing, <i>&#8220;As for me, I will
behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness&#8221;</i> (Psalm
17:15). In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p>Sister Burton and I are delighted to be on this beautiful campus today. We are grateful for the
very warm and cordial welcome we have received from administrators, faculty, and students.
Thank you! Just two weeks ago we experienced another marvelous General Conference of the
Church. It seems to me that each General Conference is better than the previous one. Perhaps
that&#8217;s a reflection on my age. I love General Conference time and the spirit and enthusiasm each
conference engenders. We are still basking in the afterglow of the conference. I hope each of you
can still feel the warmth of the sweet spirit of that special conference. As I look back on the
conference, I recall the beauty and vitality of the music performed. I recall the electricity in the
air when we were taught the order of the Church as two great men were called to receive the
Melchizedek Priesthood office of Apostle. I suspect there were a few wows expressed on this
campus as one of those names was so familiar and such an integral part of this institution. It
raises a question. How do you address your Apostle/President? Elder? President? I suspect he
would prefer to forego the issues of protocol if he could and just be called dear friend.</p>
<p>The Wednesday morning preceding conference, President Hinckley, in addressing the General
Authorities, talked about the process of selecting members of the Twelve and indicated he did
not know the will of the Lord at that time pertaining to the replacement of Elders Haight and
Maxwell. The next day during the temple meeting he again talked about the process but finished
his remarks by saying that he knew the will of the Lord in the matter but we would have to wait
to find out.</p>
<p>It seemed to me this conference was primarily focused on basic doctrine. We heard much about
faith, repentance, testimony, love, covenants, fasting, and the Savior, just to name a few. General
conferences seem to take upon themselves a distinct personality as they roll out. It is as if a
master menu of compatible and coordinated themes have been decreed from on high. Of course,
such is not the case. Inspired men and women, blessed by the Lord, and tutored by the Spirit
independently combine to produce the unique event we know as General Conference.</p>
<p>This past conference my assignment was to speak during the last hour of the last day. By the
time I spoke the conference&#8217;s personality had been well established. As each preceding speaker
finished their inspired remarks I began to feel like I was the only one who failed to get the
message or that I was going the wrong way on a freeway. My chosen theme (I hope inspired
theme) was not within the personality sphere of the conference. Faced with prospect of
delivering my prepared remarks or relying on the Spirit for "up to the pulpit" inspiration, I
decided to give my prepared "more can be less" speech. I do know and understand the difference
between wisdom and valor, so I proceeded with what I had prepared. I really don&#8217;t know how the
message was received by members around the world. I earnestly pray I didn&#8217;t detract from the
Spirit and personality of this sacred event.</p>
<p>Two little stories give me hope. Two days after General Conference concluded I received this
letter:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>There has been some concern from our 8-year-old that writing this letter
is bragging, but I (the mom) felt that it makes it more personal and meaningful

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>A family happily saving for Disneyland next year!</i></p>
<p>The anonymous letter postmarked from Snowflake, Arizona contained a bank draft for one
thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The second story is a little closer to home. It involves an eight-year-old grandson. It seems as
little Sam, our wonderful grandson, has been collecting Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards (I had not heard of
them before and know little about them) and happened to acquire one of the most cherished and
sought-after cards called the Blue-eyed White Dragon. A friend learned Sam owned the rare card
and attempted to negotiate a trade. After much give and take, a deal was struck between the two
boys. Sam would receive a whole stack of his friend&#8217;s cards and in turn Sam would surrender the
Blue-eyed White Dragon card. During Family Home This evening on the day after conference
Sam&#8217;s family talked about conference talks. On Sunday, Sam had attended General Conference
to render much needed support to his grandfather. Sam, of course, heard the more can be less
talk. Late Monday evening Sam came to his mother sobbing. She inquired why he was crying.
Between sobs he tearfully said: &#8220;Grandpa is right. More is not better. I want the Blue-eyed White
Dragon more than all the cards I received in trade.&#8221; Mother and son had a soothing conversation.</p>
<p>The rest of the story follows. Unbeknownst to Sam his older brother was a witness to the
negotiations and the ultimate trade. He quietly negotiated a trade himself. By parting with a
popular toy he gained possession of the valuable card. He didn&#8217;t share his secret with Sam. On
Tuesday morning Sam asked his mother if it would be OK if he went to his friend and asked him
to reverse the trade. Sam&#8217;s wise mother said, &#8220;You can ask but know that you likely will not be
successful and remember a deal is a deal.&#8221; It was when he approached his friend that Sam
learned his own brother was the owner of the favorite card. Appropriate arrangements were
made, and now Sam has resumed ownership of the much revered Blue-eyed White Dragon and is
also much wiser when it comes to <i>more may not necessarily be better</i>.</p>
<p>One hundred seven years ago the personality of a general conference was detected by then
President of the Church, Wilford Woodruff. His feelings prompted him to conclude the
conference by offering the following comments:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>There are a few moments I would like to spend in talking upon one particular
point that has been spoken about today. Brother Brigham has referred to it, and
our brethren this fore-noon alluded to it. It is in regard to the written word of
God and the living oracles. Perhaps you may think that Brother Woodruff is
hardly a suitable man to speak upon this subject, seeing he is President of the
Church, but I think you will find I am when I get through. I will refer to a certain
meeting I attended in the town of Kirtland in my early days. At that meeting some
remarks were made that have been made here today, with regard to the living
oracles and with regard to the written word of God. The same principle was
presented, although not as extensively as it has been here, when a leading man in
the Church got up and talked upon the subject, and said: &#8216;You have got the word
of God before you here in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and
Covenants; you have the written word of God, and you who give revelations
should give revelations according to those books, as what is written in those
books is the word of God. We should confine ourselves to them.&#8217;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When he concluded, Brother Joseph turned to Brother Brigham Young and said,
&#8220;Brother Brigham I want you to take the stand and tell us your views with regard
to the written oracles and the written word of God.&#8221; Brother Brigham took the
stand, and he took the Bible, and laid it down; he took the Book of Mormon, and
laid it down; and he took the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and laid it down
before him, and he said: &#8220;There is the written word of God to us, concerning the
work of God from the beginning of the world, almost to our day. And now,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;when compared with the living oracles those books are nothing to me; those
books do not convey the word of God direct to us now, as do the words of a
Prophet or a man bearing the Holy Priesthood in our day and generation. I would
rather have the living oracles than all the writing in the books. That was the
course he pursued.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When he was through, Brother Joseph said to the congregation: &#8220;Brother
Brigham has told you the word of the Lord, and he has told you the truth.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Now before any of you decide to throw away your scriptures or allow dust to gather on them,
listen to what additional advice President Woodruff gave:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We should all understand this. The Bible is all right, the Book of Mormon is all
right, the Doctrine and Covenants is all right, and they proclaim the work of God
and the word of God in the earth in this day and generation until the coming of
the Son of Man; but the Holy Priesthood is not confined particularly to those
books, that is, it did not cease when those books were made</i>.</p>
<p>English lexicon continues to evolve over time. Today &#8220;alright&#8221; is one word and usually conveys
an unenthusiastic approval. &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s alright,&#8221; with a shrug of the shoulders is a typical
response. President Woodruff&#8217;s &#8220;all right&#8221; was two words and literally meant all is right or true.
Therefore, President Woodruff was not giving the scriptures a casual unenthusiastic endorsement
but rather a strong, ringing statement of their veracity and value.</p>
<p>I love the words of the modern, latter-day prophets just as I love the scriptures. Along with my
scriptures I carry what I term my &#8220;Hinckley Bible.&#8221; I hope that title is appropriate. It is a
compilation of President Hinckley&#8217;s messages delivered in General Conference since he was
sustained as President of the Church. I read and refer to President Hinckley&#8217;s words just as I
study the scriptures.</p>
<p>At this past conference one of the landmark talks on the need for apostles and prophets was
given by one who has been ordained to the holy apostleship, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland. Can you
remember what he said? Why does Christ&#8217;s church have a foundation of apostles and prophets?
Let me remind you using Elder Holland&#8217;s text:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Among other reasons, so &#8216;that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and
fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and
cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive&#8217;</i>(Ephesians 4:14).</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Thus,&#8221;</i> Elder Holland continued,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>the apostolic and prophetic foundation of the Church was to bless in all times, but
especially in times of adversity or danger, times when we might feel like children,
confused or disoriented, perhaps a little fearful, times in which the devious hand
of men or the maliciousness of the devil would attempt to unsettle or mislead.
Against such times as come in our modern day, the First Presidency and Quorum
of the Twelve are commissioned by God and sustained by you as &#8216;prophets, seers,
and revelators,&#8217; with the President of the Church...authorized to exercise all of
the revelatory and administrative keys for the Church.</i></p>
<p>Elder Holland noted that</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>the incomparable Ralph Waldo Emerson rocked the very foundations of New
England ecclesiastical orthodoxy when he said to the Divinity School at Harvard:
&#8216;It is my duty to say to you that the need was never greater [for] new revelation
than now. The doctrine of inspiration is lost. . . . Miracles, prophecy,. . . . the holy
life, exist as ancient history [only]. . . . Men have come to speak of . . . revelation
as somewhat long ago given and done, as if God were dead. . . . It is the office of
a true teacher,&#8217; he warned, &#8216;to show us that God is, not was; that He speaketh,
not spake.&#8217; In essence, Mr. Emerson was saying, &#8216;If you persist in handing out
stones when people ask for bread, they will eventually stop coming to the bakery&#8217;
		</i>(Louis Cassels, quoted in Howard W. Hunter, &#8220;Spiritual Famine,&#8221; 
		<i>Ensign</i> 1973,
64).</p>
<p>In conclusion Elder Holland asked: <i>&#8220;Do you believe God speaks to man?&#8221;</i> And in response to
his question he answered:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>In all else that he accomplished in his brief 38 and a half years, Joseph left us
above all else the resolute legacy of divine revelation&#8212;not a single, isolated
revelation without evidence or consequence, and not a &#8216;mild sort of inspiration
seeping into the minds of all good people&#8217; everywhere, but specific, documented,
ongoing directions from God. As a good friend and faithful LDS scholar has
succinctly put it, &#8216;At a time when the origins of Christianity were under assault by
the forces of Enlightenment rationality, Joseph Smith [unequivocally and
singlehandedly] returned modern Christianity to its origins in revelation.</i></p>
<p>I hope we understand the magnificence of the legacy left by the prophet of the restoration.</p>
<p>So what did the prophets teach us this past general conference? What do you remember just
fifteen days after the event? Perhaps we need a mini-refresher course in General Conference 101.
Less than one minute into his opening comments, President Hinckley surprised everyone, as he
is prone to do on occasion. What was the surprise? A marvelous lesson in Church governance.
Without the roll of drums or the sound of a trumpets he quietly expressed the will of the Lord by
saying with sobriety and dignity:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>After fasting and prayer we have called Elder Dieter Friedrich Uchtdorf and
Elder David Allan Bednar to fill [the] vacancies in the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles. We present their names to you this morning. You may not know them,
but you will soon get acquainted with them. Those of you who feel you can sustain
them in this sacred calling will please signify by the uplifted hand. Any who may
be opposed?</i></p>
<p>What should we have learned from this simple event&#8212;An event which had not taken place for
over nine years and probably beyond the memory of many of you? A prophet, after fasting and
praying, received the will of the Lord and nominated; a quorum of Apostles ratified the
nomination; and the membership of the Church lifted their hands to signify their desire to
sustain. We witnessed, firsthand, how the Lord governs His kingdom.</p>
<p>President Hinckley will be fondly remembered for many things. Perhaps the construction of
temples will be the one that most will remember. Do you recall what he said about temple
construction? As he talked about the condition of the Church he stated: <i>&#8220;We continue to build
temples. We recently broke ground for a new temple in Sacramento, California, the seventh in
that state, where we have the second largest membership of any state in the United States.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The temples in the Salt Lake City area are extremely busy and at times are
overloaded. For this reason, we have determined to build a new temple in the Salt
Lake Valley. The location of the site will be announced shortly. It may appear that
we are unduly favoring this area. But temple attendance is such that we must
accommodate those who wish to come. And if the present growth trends continue,
we shall probably need yet another.</i></p>
<p>And then to the delight of Church members in Idaho he announced:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We will construct another temple in Idaho, where we have the third largest
membership in the United States. Plans are going forward for one in Rexburg.
Now we are also planning to build another in the city of Twin Falls. This temple
will serve thousands of our members who live [in that area].</i></p>
<p>What is the underlying significance of these temple announcements? I submit, a prophet of God
continues to be prompted to go forward in building temples so the great work of redeeming the
dead can be accomplished. What does it mean for you and me? It means we will be asked to
sacrifice some of our time to keep the lights of the temples burning. As the conference
concluded, President Hinckley had something to say about keeping the lights of the temple
burning. Do you remember? In a pleading way he said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I would hope that we might go to the house of the Lord a little more frequently. As
I indicated at the opening session, we have done all that we know how to do to
bring temples closer to our people. There are still many who have to travel long
distances. I hope they will continue to make that effort until such time as a temple
is justified in their midst.</i></p>
<p>Further he observed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Most of our temples could be much busier than they are. In this noisy, bustling,
competitive world, what a privilege it is to have a sacred house where we may
experience the sanctifying influence of the Spirit of the Lord. The element of
selfishness crowds in upon us constantly. We need to overcome it, and there is no
better way than to go the house of the Lord and there serve in a vicarious
relationship in behalf of those who are beyond the veil of death. . . . Just as our
redeemer gave His life as a vicarious sacrifice for all men, and in so doing
became our Savior, even so we, in a small measure, when we engage in proxy
work in the temple, become as saviors to those on the other side who have no
means of advancing unless something is done in their behalf of those on earth.</i></p>
<p>And then this prophetic promise:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>It [temple proxy work] will refine your natures. It will peel off the selfish shell in
which most of us live. It will literally bring a sanctifying element into our lives
and make us better men and better women.</i></p>
<p>I can only say "wow" to these prophetic promises.</p>
<p>President Hinckley reminded us that the Book of Mormon was recently included in the list of the
20 most influential books ever published. Do you recall what he then announced? He said: 
		<i>&#8220;We
are now joining hands with a commercial publisher to enlarge the distribution of this sacred
volume, this second witness of the Lord Jesus Christ.</i>&#8221; What does it mean to &#8220;join hands with a
commercial publisher?&#8221; It means this sacred record will be available in thousands of book stores
and other retail outlets that probably would not otherwise carry the book. I have with me, and
I&#8217;m sure most of you cannot see it, one of the first copies published by Doubleday. In the flyleaf
page Doubleday states:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For the 12 million members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
worldwide, the Book of Mormon is literally the word of God, a companion volume
to the Bible that contains the everlasting gospel. With the faith now of one of the
fastest-growing religions in the country, Doubleday is proud to publish this first
official trade edition of the Book of Mormon by special arrangement with the
Church.</i></p>
<p>While there are, of course, uncertainties in ventures of this sort, the positive possibilities are
astronomical.</p>
<p>President Hinckley concluded the priesthood session speaking to a theme he has spoken about a
number of times. Sisters, while the prophet spoke with candor directly to the brethren, I would
like to broaden the audience to include you. While what was discussed used to be largely an
addiction involving men, times have changed, and more and more women are falling victims to
this malady. This is what our beloved President said with deep emotion: <i>&#8220;I reluctantly speak to a
theme that I have dealt with before. I do it in the spirit of the words of Alma who said: &#8216;This is
my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to
repentance&#8217; </i>(Alma 29:9)<i>.&#8221;</i> I hope we listen very intently when a prophet of God issues a call to
repentance. When the Lord prompts His prophet to remind us multiple times, we need to take
heed. This is the way President Hinckley approached the subject. <i>&#8220;While the matter of which I
speak was a problem then [referring to the last time he warned us] it is a much more serious
problem now. It grows increasingly worse.&#8221;</i> Listen carefully to the words he chose: &#8220;<i>It is like a
raging storm, destroying individuals and families, utterly ruinng what was once wholesome and
beautiful. I speak of pornography in all of its manifestations.&#8221;</i> Then he said,<i> &#8220;And sin it is. It is
devilish. It is totally inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel, with personal testimony of the
things of God, and with the life of one who has been ordained to the holy priesthood.&#8221;</i> We may
also say the same for all of us who have membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints.</p>
<p>President Hinckley described the seriousness of the problem by saying:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Suffice it to say that all who are involved become victims. Children are exploited,
and their lives are severely damaged. The minds of youth become warped with
false concepts. Continued exposure leads to addiction that is almost impossible to
break. Men [and women], so very many, find they cannot leave it alone. Their
energies and their interests are consumed in the dead-end pursuit of this raw and
sleazy fare.</i></p>
<p>We have learned that when President Hinckley brings sin to our attention he always suggests
some way to remedy and avoid the sin. So what did he suggest on this occasion?</p>
<p>He said: <i>&#8220;The excuse is given that it is hard to avoid, that it is right at our fingertips and there is
no escape.&#8221;</i> You can tell he doesn&#8217;t buy into that often-used excuse. Rather he draws our
attention to a simple analogy about the weather. What was it? <i>&#8220;Suppose a storm is raging and
the winds howl and the snow swirls about you. You find yourself unable to stop it [the wind and
snow]. But you can dress properly and seek shelter, and the storm will have no effect upon you.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Likewise,&#8221;</i> he said, <i>&#8220;even though the Internet is saturated with sleazy material, you do not have
to watch it. You can retreat to the shelter of the gospel and its teaching of cleanliness and virtue
and purity of life.&#8221;</i> He described some remedies which included <i>&#8220;not viewing salacious
magazines; not reading books laden with smut; not watching television that is beneath
wholesome standards; not renting movies that depict that which is filthy and not sitting at the
computer and playing with pornographic material found on the Internet.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>President Hinckley&#8217;s concluding pleas stirred my soul as he addressed those engaged in
pornographic material when he said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If there be any within the sound of my voice who are doing so, then may you plead
with the Lord out of the depths of your soul that He will remove from you the
addiction which enslaves you. And may you have the courage to seek the loving
guidance of your bishop and, if necessary, the counsel of caring professionals.</i></p>
<p>May our Father in Heaven bless us with the desire, courage and ability to listen to and follow the
words of living prophets.</p>

<p>On 30 August 1992 a survey was conducted in which 250 returned missionaries were asked to
respond to questions about Section 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Survey: Doctrine and Covenants, 4</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">1. Are you familiar with the contents of Section 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">2. Can you recite any passage(s) from Section 4?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">3. Section 4 was given by the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith to<span style="text-decoration: underline">
</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">4. What was his occupation?<span style="text-decoration: underline">
</span></p>
<p>Of the 219 respondents, 210 claimed a content recognition, 192 claimed a memorized familiarity
with the section, 69 knew that the revelation was given through the Prophet Joseph to his father,
and 80 correctly identified the main occupation of Joseph Smith Sr. The compiled survey results
suggest the impressive familiarity of the respondents with the contents of Section 4 and their
lack of awareness of the person mentioned in the Lord&#8217;s revelation. (If findings of the survey as
conclusive, rationale in support of the respondents is found in Section 4: &#8220;Therefore, O ye that
embark . . .&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;ye&#8221; in the King James Bible is plural, meaning &#8220;You all.&#8221;) If the
Lord had set aside or had forgotten the individual as had most of the respondents, would there
have been a revelation? I believe that without the individual, in this case Joseph Smith Sr., the
revelation would not have been given.</p>
<p>The response of the returned missionaries is perhaps typical of other Latter-day Saints. All of us
can benefit by knowing that Joseph Smith Sr. followed the trade of wheat farming. He had
labored for decades with his hands using a sickle (a crude farm instrument used for cutting grain
and grass. See Alma 26:5; Doctrine and Covenants 6:3; Doctrine and Covenants 31:5) to lay up
in store a harvest that had physically sustained his family. He was now being asked to work in a
different field, to lay up in store with all his heart, might, mind, and strength the truths of the
gospel. Because his eye was single to the glory of God, he was qualified for the urgency of the
work that lay before him. For the next eleven years he would labor as a husband, father,
missionary, and patriarch.</p>
<p>Why had the surveyed missionaries paid little attention to him in their study or memorization of
the revelation? One reason may be reflected in the titles of the Doctrine and Covenants sections.
The numeric titles differ from named segments in other standard works.(Orson Pratt, a
recognized mathematician, put these sections in their numerical order in 1876.) Names like
Moroni, Ruth, and Matthew help readers recall the names and deeds of individuals, whereas the
numeric system does not. (The Doctrine and Covenants is the only scripture that has
contemporary headings that identify the individuals and circumstances involved. Some may
conclude that individuals are better identified in the Doctrine and Covenants than other scriptural
texts.) Another reason is heralded in 1 Nephi 19:23, <i>&#8220;I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it
might be for our profit and learning.&#8221;</i> This rationale, albeit important, should not limit the
greater truths, analogies, and &#8220;likenings&#8221; that can be gained from learning about the lives of
individuals mentioned in scripture.</p>
<p>I believe the Lord included the names of individuals for a purpose. Would he want us to know
why one man was called on a mission to the south and another to the north? Why one would be
assigned to be a recorder and another designated a printer? Why some men were worthy to
receive the Melchizedek priesthood while others needed to wait? A total of 101 sections in the
Doctrine and Covenants name at least one individual other than Joseph Smith in the text, the
heading, and/or the italicized captions. In the 101 sections, 130 contemporaries of Joseph Smith
are named by name (128 males and two females, the women named being Emma Smith and
Vienna Jacques). The average age of those named is 38 years--the same age as Joseph Smith at
this death. The oldest man so named was Daniel Miles age 69 and the youngest was Heman
Basset, age 17.</p>
<p>The most common reason a name appeared in the Doctrine and Covenants was the Lord&#8217;s
invitation to that individual to serve a mission, with the phraseology being to &#8220;take a journey.&#8221;
The second reason was to call an individual to preside over a priesthood quorum, the third, to
have a man be ordained to a priesthood office, and the fourth, and least mentioned, a reprimand
for failure to magnify a calling.</p>
<p>Of the 130 contemporaries of Joseph Smith mentioned by name in the Doctrine and Covenants,
only 72 died as faithful members of the Church&#8211;that means only 55 percent remained true to
their covenants (See end of text*). Of that percentage, not all remained faithful throughout their
lives&#8211;some fell away into forbidden paths but found their way back to faithfulness before their
deaths. That leaves 45 percent who died outside of Church fellowship. Of those, 7 percent sought
to destroy the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith and to take his life (The eight apostates
were John C. Bennett, Ezra Booth, John Corrill, John A. Hicks, William Law, William McLellin,
Robert D. Foster, and Symonds Ryder).</p>
<p>What can we learn from those named in the Doctrine and Covenants? The &#8220;likenings&#8221; are
incredible and reveal as much about the strengths and weakness of those named as perhaps
ourselves. Consistently, the first thing learned was that those who stayed faithful throughout
their lives enjoyed the continuing blessing of having the spirit of God at all times. One example,
taken from the life of Heber C. Kimball, illustrates this point. After being baptized and
confirmed, he penned, <i>&#8220;I received the Holy Ghost, as the disciples did in ancient days, which
was like a consuming fire&#8221;</i>(Orson F. Whitney, <i>Life of Heber C. Kimball, an Apostle, the Father
and Founder of the British Mission</i> (Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1888), 22). As I
studied his life, I found that he never lost that feeling even in times of great stress and trial. On 4
June 1837 the Prophet Joseph Smith said, &#8220;Brother Heber, the Spirit of the Lord has whispered
to me: `Let my servant Heber go to England and proclaim my Gospel, and open the door of
salvation to that nation.&#8217;&#8221; In obedience to the prophetic prompting, Heber &#8220;felt a determination
to go at all hazards&#8221; (104) &#8220;I put my trust in God, believing that He would assist me in
publishing the truth, give me utterance, and be a present help in time of need (119). His
confidence was not misplaced. After preaching to a gathering in Chatburn, England, he felt
someone pulling at his coat exclaiming,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#8220;Maister maister.&#8221; I turned around and asked what was wanted. . . . &#8220;Please sir, will you
baptize me?&#8221; &#8220;And me?&#8221; &#8220;And me?&#8221; exclaimed more than a dozen voices. Accordingly I
went down into the water and baptized twenty-five (171).</p>
<p>Of his glorious success on that mission, Heber exclaimed, &#8220;Blessed be the name of the Lord,
who has crowned our labors with such success!&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast to Heber C. Kimball are those who were faithful for a time. But for various reasons,
they chose to spend part of their lives outside of Church fellowship. Fortunately, along their life
path, they found their way back to full fellowship. One such man was Martin Harris, a witness to
the Book of Mormon. He claimed for years that &#8220;I never did leave the Church; the Church left
me&#8221; (Madge Harris Tuckett and Belle Harris Wilson, <i>The Martin Harris Story with Biographies
of Emer Harris and Dennison Lott Harris</i> (Provo, Utah: Vintage Book, 1983), 75). The Church
did move on. It would take Martin decades to return. It was not until he was in his late eighties
that he found his way back. In surprise, after gazing at the Salt Lake Temple and Tabernacle and
the beautiful Salt Lake City, he exclaimed, &#8220;who would have thought that the Book of Mormon
would have done all this?&#8221; (Journal History, June 1, 1877.)</p>
<p>Then there was Oliver Cowdery who spent ten years outside of the fellowship of the Saints. At a
conference held on 24 October 1848 he addressed the assembled congregation,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>Friends and Brethren: My name is Cowdery&#8211;Oliver Cowdery. In the history of the
Church I stood identified with him [Joseph Smith], and was in her councils not because I
was better than other men . . . I wrote with my own pen the entire Book of Mormon (save
a few pages) as it fell from the lips of the Prophet Joseph Smith . . . That book is true . . .
Brethren, for a number of years, I have been separated from you. I now desire to come
back. . . . I seek no station. I only wish to be identified with you </i>(As cited in Jenson, 
		<i>LDS
Biographical Encyclopedia</i>, 1:249).</p>
<p>Oliver Cowdery was baptized on 12 November 1848 in the Missouri River by Orson Hyde.</p>
<p>Thomas B. Marsh, once President of the Quorum of the Twelve, is next. In August 1838 the oft-quoted &#8220;cream strippings&#8221; incident occurred. The wife of Thomas and the wife of George W.
Harris desired to make cheese:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>. . . neither of them possessed the requisite number of cows, but agreed to exchange milk.
. . . Mrs. Marsh wishing to make some extra good cheese, saved a pint of strippings from
each cow and sent Mrs. Harris the milk without the strippings </i>(George A. Smith, in
		<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 3:283).</p>
<p>From small beginnings, the issue over the strippings escalated. Perhaps John Taylor said it best:
&#8220;[Thomas] seemed to have lost all the spirit and power and manhood that he once enjoyed&#8221;
(Homer Durham, <i>The Gospel Kingdom</i> (Independence, Missouri: Zion&#8217;s Printing and Publishing
Company, 1943), 185-86). After this, &#8220;In meeting with some of the apostates he said to them,
&#8216;You don&#8217;t know what you are about; if you want to see the fruits of apostasy look at me.&#8217;&#8221;
(Journal History, August 9, 1857). He lamented, &#8220;Oh, if I could see Joseph, and talk with him
and acknowledge my faults to him, and get his forgiveness from him as I have to Brother Harris,
then I would die happy.&#8221; (Journal of Wandle Mace, LDS Church Archives). Before a
congregation in the bowery in Salt Lake City, he said, &#8220;I want your fellowship; I want your God
to be my God . . . I have learned to understand what David said when he exclaimed, &#8216;I would
rather be a doorkeeper in the House of God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.&#8217;&#8221; (Thomas
B. Marsh, in <i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 5:206-08).</p>
<p>What did Thomas, Martin, and Oliver have in common? They had the truth, the spirit of God and
each failed to care for, tend, and nourish this great treasure. They paused in their work and in so
doing lost for a moment, and some for years, the joy of fellowship with the Saints and the
blessings that come from righteous living.</p>
<p>Of those who died outside the faith, none was more famous than John Farnham Boynton. Once a
faithful apostle, John choose a different road. In 1837 he lashed out against Joseph Smith, calling
him a fallen prophet. By 1838, he had turned his energy to the study of science, and had become
known as a pioneer in the field of popular science. He invented a fluid and light apparatus for the
rapid generation of carbonic acid gas that could be carried by one man to extinguish small fires.
He also invented a soda fountain, a method for extracting gold from ore by a vacuum process,
various electrical appliances, the process for converting cast iron into malleable steel, and a
method for coloring buttons and glassware. Over thirty patents are credited to John Boynton and
at least three partnerships, the manufacturing of coarse salt, tar roofing and wall plaster. As he
neared the end of his life John&#8217;s interest turned to collecting and compiling historic records of
the Boynton family. He was President of the Boynton Association with over 600 members
organized for the purpose of gathering, collecting and preserving family history.</p>
<p>In 1872 he visited with Brigham Young in Utah. As he mingled with his former friends he was
warmly greeted and referred to as &#8220;Brother John.&#8221; Elder Erastus Snow, whom he had ordained a
teacher, told him he had taught the same gospel ever since his ordination. John said, &#8220;Stick to it,
for it is good&#8221; (Forace Green, <i>Testimonies of Our Leaders</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1958),
120). John, however, did not stick to it. He died at his home on 20 October 1890 at age 79
outside the faith. He once had the &#8220;pearl of great price&#8221; but not at the end. He failed to endure.</p>
<p>The last category are those who turned their heel against the Prophet Joseph Smith. Almon
Whiting Babbitt, an attorney-at-law and a graduate from the State University at Cincinnati who
obtained licenses to practice law in six states, is our last example. On 19 January 1841, the Lord
revealed to the Prophet that &#8220;there are many things with which I am not pleased,&#8221; in speaking of
Babbitt. &#8220;Behold, he aspireth to establish his counsel instead of the counsel which I have
ordained, even that of the Presidency of my Church; and he setteth up a golden calf for the
worship of my people&#8221; (D&amp;C 124:84). Nowhere is the concept of a &#8220;golden calf&#8221; better seen in
his life than in June 1844. The day before the martyrdom, Uncle John Smith visited the Prophet
in Carthage Jail and received instructions to &#8220;. . . tell Almon W. Babbitt I want him to come and
assist me as an attorney at my expected trial&#8221; (Smith, <i>History of the Church</i>, 6:598). Patriarch
Smith met with him three hours later in Macedonia, Illinois, and delivered the message. Almon
replied, &#8220;You are too late, I am already engaged on the other side&#8221; (Smith,
		<i>History of the
Church</i>, 6:600).</p>
<p>There is a choice--which will you make. Will your life be like Heber C. Kimball, that of Thomas
B. Marsh, John F. Boynton, or Almon W. Babbitt? History does tend to repeat itself&#8211; perhaps
even in your life choices. As you make these choices, know this that faith equates to having the
spirit of God. Taking time out from righteous pursuits equates to loosing the spirit and the
confidence to accept opportunities in life. Leaving the Church, like Boynton, is never done in
isolation&#8211;it effects us all. And blatantly fighting against the Lord&#8217;s Anointed will do you know
good.</p>
<p>For me, searching for information on the individuals mentioned in the Doctrine and Covenants
has been like seeking pieces of a lost puzzle whose importance is clear but whose detailed parts
are fast fading. The frustration of reaching an impasse on the life of one man has been
compensated by the joy of discovering new insights on another. The realization of the
faithfulness of one and the disappointment in the faltering steps of another has brought to my
awareness the centrality of endurance and the concern of the Lord for each individual.</p>
<p>The Doctrine and Covenants teaches us that the Lord knows his children and his enemies by
name. He knows their talents and gifts as well as their weaknesses and imperfections. He
extended an invitation to greater service to many but not all chose to listen and accept his
directives. Some served with great joy and others discarded counsel and lost direction. The
analogies and &#8220;likenings&#8221; to be gleaned from knowing more about the individuals in the
Doctrine and Covenants are almost boundless. It is my hope that you will take note of the names
and begin to wonder about who they were, where they came from, and if they fulfilled their
divine commissions. But more importantly, to wonder about yourself. Will you choose to be
faithful. As for me and my house, we say with Joshua of old, &#8220;We will serve the Lord&#8221; (Joshua
24:15). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>On the day of the crucifixion the Savior was brought before Pilate for judgment. Pilate asked
several questions including this one: &#8220;What is truth?&#8221; In the New Testament account the Savior
doesn&#8217;t answer this question, but it is answered in the Doctrine and Covenants: 
		<i>&#8220;And truth is
knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 93:24). This is a very simple but broad definition of truth. We also learn that 
		<i>&#8220;The
glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36).
We are striving to gain more light and truth in our lives but the adversary would like to take
away light and truth from us. The scriptures explain that he can do that in two ways.  
		<i>&#8220;And that
wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of
men, and because of the tradition of their fathers</i>&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenants 93:39). There is a
key relationship between obedience and understanding eternal truths. Satan can&#8217;t take away light
and truth from us as long as we are obedient, as we have covenanted to be.</p>
<p>Why would the adversary want us to lose light and truth? We know that he seeks 
		<i>&#8220;. . . the misery
of all mankind&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 2:18). Misery comes because of sin and a person is more likely to sin if
he understands truth less. When truth is taken away because of disobedience, things that were
obvious before become more difficult to see and understand. Even people who once had strong
testimonies can get to the point of doubting and wondering about basic gospel beliefs as a result
of their disobedience (see Alma 12:9-11).</p>
<p>Disobedience leads to a loss of light and truth and also to misery, but notice the result of
obedience: <i>&#8220;He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in
truth and knoweth all things&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 93:28). That is a powerful promise.
Throughout our lives we can increase in knowledge of the truth if we will keep the
commandments.</p>
<p>If we are obedient, we keep the Spirit in our lives and are able to understand eternal truths. We
can also actively strive to increase our understanding of and commitment to follow truth. In the
course of our lives we all are exposed to eternal truth. When we are taught the truth we can
accept it, try to ignore it, or reject it. The scriptures have some clear examples of how different
people respond when they are faced with truth. Let&#8217;s look at some examples in the scriptures so
we can derive some characteristics of those who respond properly to truth and those who don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Nephi&#8217;s brother, Jacob, taught</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . Do not say that I have spoken hard things against you; for if ye do, ye will
revile against the truth; for I have spoken the words of your Maker. I know that
the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness; but the righteous fear them
not, for they love the truth and are not shaken</i> (2 Nephi 9:40).</p>
<p>Notice that the righteous do not fear the words of truth. In fact, they love the truth. That is a
powerful thought&#8212;to be a lover of truth.</p>
<p>Nephi warned against being angry because of the truth,<i> &#8220;And in fine, wo unto all those who
tremble, and are angry because of the truth of God! For behold, he that is built upon the rock
receiveth it with gladness&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 28:28).  In addition to the warning he explains that the
righteous receive the truth with gladness.</p>
<p>Referring to his own writing, Nephi explains,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the plainness of the truth;
wherefore, no man will be angry at the words which I have written save he shall
be of the spirit of the devil. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my
soul from hell </i>(2 Nephi 33:5-6).</p>
<p>Those are strong words about those who are angry about truth. Knowing about Nephi&#8217;s life helps
us understand what he means when he writes &#8220;I glory in truth.&#8221; I think we all sense that he did
glory in truth.</p>
<p>In fact, let&#8217;s look at an example that contrasts Nephi&#8217;s reaction to truth with the reaction of
Laman and Lemuel to truth. Lehi had the dream of the tree and had told the dream to his family.
He had also prophesied of other important events, including the coming of the Messiah. What
did Nephi do when he had been taught by his father? This is his own account: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen,
and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat
pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an
exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I
never had before set my foot.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which
he hath spoken?</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father</i> (1 Nephi
11:1-5).</p>
<p>Nephi believed the truth when he heard it and wanted to know more about it. As a result he
increased his understanding of the truth through the visions he had. Let&#8217;s contrast that with the
reaction of Laman and Lemuel to the same truths:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And they said: Behold, we cannot understand the words which our father hath
spoken concerning the natural branches of the olive-tree, and also concerning the
Gentiles.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And I said unto them: Have ye inquired of the Lord?</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And they said unto me: We have not; for the Lord maketh no such thing known
unto us.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, I said unto them: How is it that ye do not keep the commandments of the
Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because of the hardness of your hearts?</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?&#8212;If ye will not harden
your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in
keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you</i> (1
Nephi 15:7-11).</p>
<p>After Nephi explains some of them to Laman and Lemuel we get another insight into their
reaction to truth:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of speaking to my
brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more
than we are able to bear.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I had spoken hard
things against the wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous have I
justified, and testified that they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the
guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now my brethren, if ye were righteous and were willing to hearken to the
truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk uprightly before God, then ye
would not murmur because of the truth, and say: Thou speakest hard things
against us</i> (1 Nephi 16:1-3).</p>
<p>The guilty take the truth to be hard. You may have heard the saying &#8220;the hit bird flutters.&#8221; Lehi
even told his rebellious sons that what they called anger was the truth (2 Nephi 1:26).  If the
truth clashes with our behavior or some of our strong personal beliefs we may not want to hear
it. This is a typical reaction you can even see in small children. Sometimes if you correct a child
for something he is doing wrong he may say something like, &#8220;You&#8217;re yelling at me!&#8221; even if you
are speaking in a calm tone. To a guilty person the truth seems harsh.</p>
<p>I have a three year old grandson named James. My daughter had been teaching him to be careful
about strangers. She was quizzing him to see how well he had listened to her and asked him,
&#8220;James would you ever get into a car with a stranger?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;No.&#8221; She continued,
&#8220;What if he said he would give you candy? Then would you go with him?&#8221; James thought for a
minute and finally said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not telling.&#8221; My daughter became a little alarmed and said, &#8220;James,
you never go with a stranger even if he has candy. It is very dangerous!&#8221; James then said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
talk to me mommy!&#8221; </p>
<p>The book of Acts records the people&#8217;s reaction to Stephen&#8217;s pointed testimony.  
		<i>&#8220;They cried out
with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him. . .&#8221;</i> (Acts 7:57).  Sometimes if we
are guilty we just don&#8217;t want to hear the truth.</p>
<p>Abinadi boldly taught the truth to the people of King Noah. Noah, most of the priests and most
of the people rejected the truth from Abinadi. They were also angry with him.  In fact, they were
so angry that they killed him, the bearer of truth (Mosiah 13:1).  But there was one of the priests,
Alma, who believed Abinadi&#8217;s words. He repented, began to teach the truth to others and
organized the Church of Christ among those who believed.</p>
<p>The sons of Mosiah had, at an earlier stage in their life, rebelled against the truth, but they
repented. Alma says of them:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a
sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they
might know the word of God.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting;
therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when
they taught, they taught with power and authority of God</i> (Alma 17:2-3).</p>
<p>These young men had become lovers of truth and put forth great personal efforts to learn the
truth.</p>
<p>Korihor was one of the anti-Christs in the Book of Mormon. He resisted the truth when
evidences were given him. He eventually admitted that he knew the truth and explained some
personal history that lead to his problems: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an
angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone
astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he
taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I taught them
because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I
had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for
this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great curse upon
me </i>(Alma 30:53).</p>
<p>Korihor believed Satan&#8217;s lies and withstood the truth.</p>
<p>The range of reactions to truth we read about in the scriptures is also apparent in our own time.
Some people love the truth and some people resist it. Missionaries can teach people in the same
town and some accept the truth and others reject it. I noticed a couple of passages in my great-grandfather&#8217;s missionary journals that showed the difference in people&#8217;s reactions to the truth.
He went back to his native England in the 1880s to serve a mission. He tells a story of preaching
in a meeting of another faith to a congregation of about 200 people. He explained:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I spoak (sic) for more than an hour on the literal fulfillment of prophecy, and
restoration of the Everlasting Gospel to the prophet Joseph Smith, concluded by
baring (sic) a strong testimony to the Truth of the work of God. Some of the
people were very much interested and wished me to come again, others wiggled
in their seats a good deal, when I bore testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet
of the living God.</i></p>
<p>He had another experience that was more extreme. He was speaking in a town hall to a large
group of people. Things were going well until they were just ready to close the meeting.  Then
an apostate and a group of agitators from a neighboring town came into the meeting. The
apostate began speaking to the people and telling them lies about missionaries and the church. In
my great-grandfather&#8217;s words:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>He continued to tell the blackest and foulest lies that ever was (sic) uttered by
fiends from the lower region and called on the people of Ginnislake, to drive us
out to drown us, that we were worthy of death. There was tremendous excitement
and uproar in the meeting and the mob kept pinching us and pulling our hair and
insulting us by the most foul insinuations. I finally got upon the table and asked
the people to listen to me for a short time. The place was densely packed and
more than 500 people present by this time a good many of whom wanted to hear
me. . . </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>He keep shaking his fist in my face and saying "You are a Liar&#8221; &#8220;You are a liar"
"You&#8217;re a liar" "If I had you in America I would shoot you" "I would kill you" "I
would put my little pop gun against your head" &amp; c &amp; c. He repeated those
sayings a great many times and great many people heard him say it. I got on the
table 3 or 4 times during the evening and defended our cause and ourselves as
best I could and there was the greatest possible confusion. The police had come
into the meeting soon after the row began and we placed ourselves under their
protection and I must say the police did the best to preserve the peace, but their
efforts were not of much avail for there was the greatest excitement for about 1
3/4 hours. . . </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Police thought they could conduct us to Bro Jackman&#8217;s house in safety, but
no sooner had we got outside the rabble laid hold of us, but we each laid hold of
a Policeman and hung on with all the power we had, but we and the Policeman
had great difficulty in keeping our feet, the policeman using their sticks pretty
freely. We finally got through the mob who followed us and threw stones and tufts
of grass and other things at us. The police did their uttermost to drive them back
all the time. I was struck pretty hard on the shoulder by a stone and one of the
Policemen and another friend were also struck. We arrived at our destination,
however, all safe without serious injury.</i></p>
<p>It is amazing to see how violently some people react to the truth. We see from the scriptures that
when a people gets wicked enough&#8212;ripened in iniquity&#8212;they may even seek the blood of the
prophets.</p>
<p>Just a few years before the Savior was born the Nephites had become very wicked and the Lord
had sent a prophet to prophesy to them and warn them.  The prophet was Samuel, the Lamanite,
and he explained how wicked people react to prophets.  In his words:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, wo unto this people, because of this time which has arrived, that ye do cast
out the prophets, and do mock them, and cast stones at them, and do slay them,
and do all manner of iniquity unto them, even as they did of old time.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now when ye talk, ye say: If our days had been in the days of our fathers of
old, we would not have slain the prophets; we would not have stoned them, and
cast them out.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a prophet come among
you and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your sins and
iniquities, ye are angry with him, and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to
destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a false prophet, and that he is a sinner,
and of the devil, because he testifieth that your deeds are evil</i> (Helaman 13:24-26).</p>
<p>Samuel prophesied many things to the Nephites and was very direct in testifying of their sins and
iniquities.  The Book of Mormon records two different reactions from the people:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the words of Samuel,
the Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the city.  And as many as believed
on his word went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and
found him they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they
might be baptized unto the Lord.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of Samuel were angry
with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at
him as he stood upon the wall; but the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch
that they could not hit him with their stones neither with their arrows</i> (Helaman
16:1-2).</p>
<p>Those who believed and loved the truth repented and sought the prophets and those who rejected
the truth fulfilled Samuel&#8217;s prophecy and even sought to kill him.  Let&#8217;s never be in a position
where we mock the prophets or figuratively cast stones at them.  If we love the truth we will
never find ourselves in that position.</p>
<p>What are some of the reactions to the truth we&#8217;ve seen by people who are not lovers of truth?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They are not willing to hearken (1 Nephi 16:2). 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They view the truth as sharpness and react with anger (2 Nephi 1:26). 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They murmur (1 Nephi 16:3; 2 Nephi 1:26). 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They revile against the truth (2 Nephi 9:40). 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They tremble because of the truth (2 Nephi 28:28). 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They take the truth to be hard (1 Nephi 16:2). 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They want to mock, attack or even kill the messenger (Mosiah 13:1, Helaman
13:24-26). </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They resist and withstand the truth (Alma 30:46, 53). 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They might even wiggle in their seats when they hear the truth.</p>
<p>The following are some of the reactions of those who are lovers of truth: 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They want to learn more about what they&#8217;ve heard (1 Nephi 11:1-4). 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They study, fast and pray to learn more (Alma 17:2). 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They repent and are baptized (Helaman 16:1-2).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They don&#8217;t fear the words of truth (2 Nephi 9:40). 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They receive the truth with gladness (2 Nephi 28:28). 
		</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">They glory in the truth (2 Nephi 33:7).</p>
<p>How can a person tell if he is a lover of truth? Are there indications we might be able to see in
our own lives?</p>
<p>At General Conference time lovers of truth would do everything possible to hear all the sessions,
and if they could not watch the sessions live they would try to catch it on a rebroadcast or find
some way to hear it later. Someone who wasn&#8217;t a lover of truth might look at General
Conference weekend as a time to vacation.</p>
<p>A lover of truth wouldn&#8217;t let personal study of the scriptures get squeezed out of his life because
of a busy schedule.</p>
<p>A lover of truth would listen carefully to his stake president and bishop and willingly accepting
their counsel.</p>
<p>A lover of truth wants others to know the truth and is willing to share it.</p>
<p>If a lover of truth ever caught himself becoming angry because of the teachings of the Brethren
he would repent speedily and ask the Lord to help him understand.</p>
<p>A lover of truth has faith in the Lord and His teachings and doesn&#8217;t tremble because some
teachings of the world seem to conflict with gospel truths. When there are issues that seem to
contradict the teachings of the Lord the lover of truth is patient and knows that truth will prevail.</p>
<p>Lovers of truth are very careful not to expose themselves to unworthy media.  They know it
affects their ability to see truth clearly and drives the Spirit from their lives.</p>
<p>A lover of truth understands the link between obedience and gaining true knowledge.  A lover of
truth doesn&#8217;t try to push the limits of the commandments or see how close to the line he can
walk, even with issues like dress and grooming standards.</p>
<p>A lover of truth does not resist the promptings of the Spirit, but learns to feel the Spirit and act
on the inspiration.</p>
<p>As part of a great promise in the last chapter of the Book of Mormon, Moroni explains that, 
		<i>&#8220;. . .
by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things&#8221; </i>(Moroni 10:5).</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost as a source of truth is such a powerful influence in our lives.  We choose how
we react to the truths that come from the Spirit.  If we can learn to love those truths and live
worthily to receive more truth we can eventually know the truth of all things.</p>
<p>Not long ago I was in a country that has had missionaries only in the last 15 years or so.  The
member of the church who was driving me to a meeting made a comment as we drove past a
cathedral.  &#8220;That&#8217;s where I first felt the Spirit&#8221; he said.  He went on to explain, &#8220;When I was a
boy I went in that cathedral and as I was looking at the paintings and thinking about Jesus I
suddenly knew that he was real and that what I had heard about him was not just a fable but was
true.&#8221;  He said that years later when the missionaries came he felt the same thing again as they
taught him.  He learned the truth by the Spirit and loved the truth.  It has made all the difference
in his life.  He has an eternal marriage and is finding true joy raising his young family.</p>
<p>I pray we will determine to be lovers of truth.  If we will our lives will be bright and our futures
unlimited.</p>
<p>I want you to know that there are some things I know to be true.  I know we have a loving
Heavenly Father.  I know that his son, Jesus Christ, lives.  I know that the atonement of Jesus
Christ is real and infinite.  It is powerful enough that we will all be resurrected and powerful
enough that we can be cleansed from all our sins.  Joseph Smith was an instrument in restoring
the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth and the church is led today by a living
prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great delight and opportunity to be with you during this week of Thanksgiving, though I
recognize it is a tough time to be a turkey! (And I speak somewhat from personal experience in
this regard!) That aside, I&#8217;m thankful to have not yet attained &#8220;stuffed status&#8221; and for bounteous
blessings, including the privilege of working and living and learning among you and of being
uplifted by your energy and goodness. Hardly a day goes by that I&#8217;m not reminded of what a
privilege it is to work and serve on this campus and hope you feel that way as well.</p>
<p>In contemplating recent experiences common at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho, many impressions and images
come to mind. They include being in the Idaho Falls Temple and feeling your collective strength
and goodness; being edified by your teaching and powerful testimonies; having two of you come
in and ask for support to raise $10,000 for medical equipment for a 5-year-old boy; grading
examples of creative, professional-quality work that rivals anything produced anywhere;
receiving a thoughtful note or two &#8211; with plates of cookies and other goodies that could
contribute to grade inflation; listening to a delightful persuasive speech &#8211; by a male, of course &#8211;
suggesting that women who ask men on dates are fulfilling the commandment to act and not be
acted upon; witnessing the spiritual synergy of service as 400 of you fill a cultural hall and
compile, pack and load for shipment more than 1,000 school kits for needy children worldwide;
being mistaken for BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho religion professor Greg Palmer, which happens often and always
makes my day; interviewing some of you for temple recommends and Church callings; sensing
the support of hundreds of you for a young man who, in stake conference, speaks from a tender
heart about being the only Church member in his family, and of his desire to overcome parental
and sibling animosity concerning his conversion; observing countless small acts of courtesy and
kindness &#8211; from doors held to equipment carried to encouragement given classmates who
struggle with an assignment; listening to you discuss world events with wisdom and insights
beyond your years; and sensing in these and so many other things compassion and commitment
and capacity and courage connected to your covenants that conveys great hope and confidence in
the future of the Church as you move forward as leaders and lights in a darkening world. Thank
you for who and what you are and are becoming &#8211; and for what you represent and do.</p>
<p>In these examples &#8211; and countless others we could share &#8211; is a consistent theme of what I would
like to call &#8220;sacred support&#8221; &#8211; the title of this address. This includes support for one another, for
the Lord and His Church, and for each of us from a loving Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son
who direct, sustain, tutor, cleanse and comfort us through the Holy Ghost. As those in the &#8220;fold
of God&#8221; who are &#8220;called his people,&#8221; we are nurtured and supported by each other as a result of
being <i>&#8220;willing to bear one another&#8217;s burdens, that they may be light; Yea, and are willing to
mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand
as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in&#8230;that ye
may be redeemed of God&#8230;that ye may have eternal life&#8221; </i>(Mosiah 18:8-9).</p>
<p>This notion of &#8220;sacred support&#8221; originates in the 44<sup>th</sup> Chapter of Alma, where Captain Moroni &#8211;
whose workout and leadership-training programs I&#8217;d like to someday adopt &#8211; speaks boldly to
Lamanite leader Zerahemnah. Moroni and his men had gained the upper hand in battle, and he
called upon Zerahemnah and his troops to lay down their weapons of war and enter into a
covenant of peace. Moroni explains to Zerahemnah that it was the support of the Lord that has
given the Nephites their advantage. <i>&#8220;Yea, ye see that God will support, and keep, and preserve
us, so long as we are faithful unto him, and unto our faith, and our religion&#8221;</i> (Alma 44:4). 
		</p>
<p>He then commands the Lamanites to disarm and depart in peace,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>in the name of that all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we
have gained power over you, by our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of
worship (ordinances), and by our church, and by the 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">sacred support</span> which we
owe to our wives and our children &#8230; and also by the maintenance of the sacred
word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto
us</i> (Alma 44:5, emphasis added).</p>
<p>This brief phrase, &#8220;sacred support,&#8221; has resonated in my mind and feelings for some time. Let&#8217;s
consider sources of sacred support in our lives and how we can render such support to other
people. We all need help from heaven and, at times, from others. And as mentioned in Mosiah
18, we are under covenant obligation to render such assistance as disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>As with all gospel doctrines, principles, ordinances and covenants, the roots of &#8220;sacred support&#8221;
tap into the all-encompassing Atonement of our Lord and Savior. He and He alone is our only
sure, unfailing source of support that we know will always be there &#8211; come what may. Family
and friends and other means of help are sometimes strong and seemingly sure. But we can all
think of examples when these and other means of strength are diminished due to change, choices,
death or other circumstances. Being built upon the <i>&#8220;rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the
Son of God,&#8221; </i>ensures</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds (and he surely will), yea, his
shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat
upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery
and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure
foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall</i> (Helaman 5:12).</p>
<p>While the Lord is always there for support, the scriptures remind us 
		<i>&#8220;that the devil will not
support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell&#8221;</i> (Alma 30:60).</p>
<p>There is never support from the adversary, who works fiendishly and frantically for our misery
and desires to destroy you. He is not a myth or fairy tale but, as the Prophet Joseph said
concerning his bout with the powers of darkness prior to the First Vision &#8211; 
		<i>&#8220;not to an imaginary
ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous
power as I had never before felt in any being&#8221; </i>(Joseph Smith History 1:16). Fortunately for
Joseph and all of us, sacred support manifested itself in the form of the Father and the Son. Peter
describes the adversary as a &#8220;roaring lion &#8230; seeking whom he may devour.&#8221; Satan despises you
for helping vanquish him in the pre-mortal world through the blood of the Lamb and the word of
your testimony. We cannot dabble in darkness without taking huge risks. Conversely, we have
nothing to fear as we are faithful.</p>
<p>When Moroni said in his final testimony that <i>&#8220;despair cometh because of iniquity,&#8221; 
		</i>(Moroni
10:22), I believe he was primarily referring to the loss of hope that comes from sin. But despair
also may result from the iniquity of others, and to spiritually sensitive souls who can become
overwhelmed with world conditions. Then, of course, there are the seemingly random bad things
that happen to good people. In all of this I testify that there really is no randomness &#8211; that God is
at the helm and notes even the sparrow&#8217;s fall. I know He does micro-manage our lives without
ever robbing us of our agency, especially as we seek His influence and support.</p>
<p>In times of trial, our faith must deepen and give way to hope in and through the Savior, which
leads to charity, the pure love of Christ. President James E. Faust noted in the October 2004
General Conference, <i>&#8220;Each of us needs to have our own storehouse of faith to help us rise above
the troubles that are part of this mortal probation&#8221;</i> (<i>Ensign </i>October 2004, p. 20). Great faith &#8211;
gleaned primarily through obedience &#8211; is why Nephi could also be filled with hope and love in
spite of persecution from his brethren, the death of his father and other difficulties. The Lord
delights to support those who <i>&#8220;look to [Him] in every thought&#8221;</i> and who doubt and fear not
(Doctrine and Covenants 6:36).</p>
<p>Between his workout sessions at the gym, Nephi spoke succinctly of sacred support and the
blessings of leaning upon the Lord:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the
wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh</i> (2 Nephi
4:20-21).</p>
<p>Perhaps the summary theme throughout the Old Testament &#8211; and really in all of scripture &#8211; is to
trust implicitly in the promises and powers of Jehovah for support. As latter-day saints, we must
have the reliance so often lacking in the children of Israel as we consistently cultivate and
demonstrate full faith in the Lord Jesus and in His plan and timetable for us.</p>
<p>If we have truly internalized the teachings of Jesus Christ as true disciples who have &#8220;no more
disposition to do evil, but to do good continually&#8221;; who have taken upon ourselves His name and
undergone a mighty change of heart and maintained a remission of sins through continual
repentance; then we qualify for the Lord&#8217;s sacred support and can count on it for cleansing,
comfort, direction, protection and strength. We will stand strong, recover when we stumble,
endure, overcome and prevail. And our journey will be joyful, in spite of external influences and
opposition. The Savior, of course, is the perfect embodiment of all of this.</p>
<p>Perhaps this box with its supports can illustrate this principle. Let&#8217;s presume the box is you or
me or any of us &#8211; more like me than you since it&#8217;s a lifeless square and doesn&#8217;t have hair. These
&#8220;pillars&#8221; represent sources of support that could be family, friends, health, employment &#8211; any
number of good things. But let&#8217;s suppose one is taken away for some reason, then another.
Suddenly, what we assumed would always be a sure foundation is undermined and looks a bit
flimsy. Then it seems as if everything is pulled out from under us through tragedy or adversity of
some sort. To outside eyes, it appears as if we will fall.</p>
<p>But the man or woman of Christ will still stand who has laid <i>&#8220;hold upon the word of God, which
is quick and powerful,&#8221; </i>and will be led in a <i>&#8220;strait and narrow course across that everlasting
gulf of misery &#8230; and land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the
kingdom of heaven&#8221; </i>(Helaman 3:29-30). This support comes from internalizing spiritual things
and having them become part of us. Our foundation then rests upon the rock of our Redeemer, as
Helaman said, &#8220;on whom for a blessing&#8221; we can call with confidence.</p>
<p>This importance of &#8220;clinging&#8221; to the rod &#8211; the word of God &#8211; and not casually touching it now
and then was reiterated when going though the Haunted Mill a few weeks ago with our 14-year-old daughter, Kristen, and three of her friends. They voted 4-1 for me to lead, then bunched up
behind me with hands on my shoulders and around my neck. It was a fearful trip, mostly due to
the screams of my young companions. And there really were moments where it was pitch dark
and confusing.</p>
<p>I thought, &#8220;Great, they&#8217;ll either have to turn on the lights to get us out of here or find us
sometime the next morning.&#8221; But I had to be brave and, fortunately, found railings or ropes at
key moments to latch on to that got us through. I would take hold of these guides really tight,
and we made it through without incident.</p>
<p>Life can likewise have twists and turns, ups and downs. I testify that clinging to the rod &#8211; the
word of God in all its forms &#8211; and maintaining the Holy Spirit as our guide is a sure source of
strength and direction through it all.</p>
<p>Besides daily immersion in prayer and scriptures, other sources of spiritual support include
priesthood ordinances and blessings, resolute repentance, personal purity, sustaining those with
keys and mantles who preside, receiving righteous rebukes, temple worship, fasting, keeping
covenants, gratitude, tithes and offerings, faithful friendships, service, ministering in word &#8211; both
written and spoken, physical and fiscal fitness, integrity, honoring the name of Christ we&#8217;ve
taken upon ourselves, and to &#8220;always remember Him and keep His commandments,&#8221; that we
may &#8220;always have His Spirit&#8221; to be with us. In all of these things there is safety, peace, joy,
power and constant support.</p>
<p>Trusting in the arm of the Lord is always essential, though at times it becomes especially critical. 
		</p>
<p>As a mission president, that reliance was literally 24/7 for three years. It had to be. The telephone
rang one morning, and I was told one of our marvelous senior missionaries, Elder Howard
Jensen, was seriously ill in a Lexington hospital 75 minutes away. Elder Jensen was a sweet,
good man and president of a small branch in southern Kentucky. He and Sister Jensen were a
remarkable source of support and leadership to the saints there.</p>
<p>Things quickly went from bad to worse with Elder Jensen&#8217;s health. I got to the hospital, where
he was receiving mechanical assistance breathing and with other vital functions. One of his sons
was there with his parents, and I ran an errand to a nearby pharmacy. Elder Jensen&#8217;s prognosis
looked grim. It was an agonizing time.</p>
<p>As I drove back into the hospital parking garage, I prayed fervently to know what to do. The
impression came that Elder Jensen would not live, that I should offer Sister Jensen a blessing
from her son and then bless Elder Jensen. The Lord would manifest His will through that
blessing, and we all would know what needed to be done. That happened, and we released Elder
Jensen to continue his faithful service on the other side of the veil, in accordance with the Lord&#8217;s
will. As difficult as these events were, I think they would have been impossible without the
constant guidance and support of the Spirit, which also provided great comfort in the aftermath.
We received a powerful witness of Elder Jensen&#8217;s sublime status and preparation.</p>
<p>In this and other experiences, prayer is such a sweet source of support. When Satan confronted
Moses,<i> &#8220;tempting him&#8221;</i> and calling him <i>&#8220;son of man,&#8221;</i> Moses remembered he was a son of God.
He was not deceived and <i>&#8220;calling upon God, he received strength&#8221;</i> and chased the adversary
from his presence (Moses 1:12-22). Nephi reminds us we must pray, and that the evil spirit
teaches us not to pray. The Brother of Jared was chastened three hours for not calling upon the
Lord, and then repented of the &#8220;evil&#8221; he had done in being neglectful. The Savior often arose
early and prayed and was strengthened in Gethsemane as He called upon His Father. How much
more, then, do we need the blessings of prayer?</p>
<p>Spiritual support is a great assurance and source of security, but as noted it doesn&#8217;t guarantee a
leisurely stroll through mortality. Yet if we walk with the Lord, as Cleopas and another disciple
discovered while traveling the Emmaus road after the resurrection of Jesus, our hearts will 
		<i>&#8220;burn
within us, while he [talks] with us by the way, and while he [opens] to us the scriptures&#8221;</i> (Luke
24:32). I witness of this reality, that Jesus is the Christ and that He has borne our sins, sorrows,
sicknesses, grief &#8211;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the
word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the
sicknesses of his people.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind
his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be
filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh
how to succor (support) his people according to their infirmities</i> (Alma 7:11-12).</p>
<p>I know Jesus descended below and experienced all things that we might rise above them, but we
must make the initiative to take His yoke upon us. He beckons, but we must act:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and
ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light
		</i>(Matthew 11:28-30).</p>
<p>This loving invitation is laced with action words on our part, such as &#8220;come,&#8221; &#8220;take,&#8221; and
&#8220;learn.&#8221; There are many things we can do to <i>&#8220;come unto Christ, and be perfected in Him, and
deny [ourselves] of all ungodliness&#8221; </i>(Moroni 10:32-33) so we can qualify for the grace of the
Savior. To merit His help, we must be <i>&#8220;doers of the word and not hearers only&#8221;</i> (James 1:22).
Then, as we receive His sacred support, we must do our best to lift and encourage others.</p>
<p>A number of years ago I witnessed a nice example of friends rejoicing in others&#8217; successes and in
cheering each other on. I drove a school bus for three years during college. It was a real kick &#8211;
everything from kindergarten kids as cute as bugs to junior high students you sometimes wanted
to squash like bugs! While driving the afternoon route for several weeks I would regularly see
the Cedar High School cross-country team working out. I enjoyed running and would clock their
speed while trying to stay off the sidewalk. There always was a pack of runners and then one
lone runner some distance behind. He ran with a noticeable limp, and I admired his spunk.
Sometime later, I received an assignment to drive this group to the regional meet in Utah
County. We had a nice trip, and I was impressed with the close-knit nature of the team. The
runner with the limp was Geoff, and his impediment stemmed from birth. He fit right in, and the
others told him this was his big day. Geoff had finished dead last in every meet to that point, and
his friends suggested this meet he would outrun someone &#8211; anyone. They built up his confidence.</p>
<p>As runner after runner staggered across the finish, heaving and huffing, there was still no Geoff.
Everyone on his team was finished, when they suddenly started to yell and cheer wildly. The
reason for their enthusiasm could be seen a quarter-mile away. Geoff was ahead of a couple of
runners and was trying to hold them off as they kicked toward the finish line. A teammate
sprinted out to meet him and ran along, cheering him on. Others whooped and hollered, and
Geoff finished ahead of one or two others to the delight of his teammates in his last race of the
season. He beamed as they slapped him on the back and congratulated him for his courage and
effort. It was a touching little scene of sacred support that fulfilled Paul&#8217;s words: 
		<i>&#8220;Ye ought to
support the weak &#8230; and to remember &#8230; it is more blessed to give than to receive&#8221;</i> (Acts 20:35).</p>
<p>Of course, like anything we wish to attain, the Lord&#8217;s support for us hinges upon our desire for it
and faith we will receive it. Before Nephi conversed with the Spirit of the Lord, he &#8220;desired to
know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them
known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea,
into an exceedingly high mountain.&#8221; In the scriptures, mountains have great significance as
places of holiness &#8211; natural temples &#8211; where the Lord often reveals Himself. From Moses on
Sinai to the Brother of Jared on Shelem to Nephi&#8217;s mountain to the Mount of Transfiguration to
Cumorah &#8211; marvelous manifestations often occur in sacred mountaintop experiences. Those
ascending these &#8220;mountains of the Lord&#8221; have clean hearts and hands and a desire to be in the
Lord&#8217;s presence and to obtain His support for sometimes difficult issues.</p>
<p>There is clarity of vision that comes from literal and figurative mountaintop experiences. We can
feel the Lord&#8217;s love and guidance every day as we pray, ponder and search the scriptures. Nephi
said that his father, Lehi, <i>&#8220;As he read, he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 1:12).
We receive this same blessing as we search the scriptures consistently.</p>
<p>It was enjoyable last summer to hike Mount Timpanogos in Utah with my brother and his sons.
The early morning trip up was delightful, with wildflowers in full bloom and not much heat. Our
light backpacks were filled with lunch, water, cameras and snacks. Like any journey to a higher
elevation, there was some fatigue. But with a goal and encouragement, it was a pretty smooth
hike. The view from the summit extended for miles and was breathtaking.</p>
<p>When we ascend spiritual summits, we may become fatigued or blistered due to the sometimes
rocky and steep trail. There was one person climbing Timp who had a badly sprained ankle and
had to turn back. Another group we passed was fearful of heights and retreated from the summit.
That didn&#8217;t matter, except they missed the view. It does matter spiritually, however, if we are
injured and can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t reach our goals and potential. Our divine destiny is at stake. Support
from higher sources and others can help keep us going, or even carry us when injured.</p>
<p>As we cry unto the Lord and qualify for His help, we can, like the people of Alma,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and
I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage </i>(that bondage
may be physical, spiritual, emotional, financial, intellectual, social, even
political).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you
cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I
do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a
surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his
brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear
up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all
the will of the Lord.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And it came to pass that so great was their faith and their patience (two key
virtues for all of us to develop) that the voice of the Lord came unto them again,
saying: Be of good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out of bondage
		</i>(Mosiah 24:13-16).</p>
<p>Sometimes &#8220;on the morrow&#8221; is literally the next day, as in this instance. But other times
deliverance &#8220;on the morrow&#8221; is according to the Lord&#8217;s reckoning of time and plan for us and
requires endurance. The Prophet Joseph learned this lesson repeatedly, including while he
languished in Liberty Jail. After months of imprisonment and abuse, Joseph understandably cried
out, <i>&#8220;O god, where art thou? &#8230; How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye &#8230; behold
from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be
penetrated with their cries?&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 121:2)</p>
<p>What was a merciful Heavenly Father&#8217;s response? <i>&#8220;My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine
adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou endure it well, God
shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes&#8221; </i>(v. 8). These foes include death,
sin, and all forms of adversity inherent in mortality.</p>
<p>The Father continued in a subsequent revelation: <i>&#8220;Know thou, my son, that all these things shall
give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. The Son of Man hath descended below them all.
Art thou greater than he?&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 122:7-8)</p>
<p>It is helpful to remember that in all afflictions, the only ones that have lasting impact are those
we inflict upon ourselves and do not properly resolve. Failure to repent &#8211; with complete
confession of serious transgressions, such as violations of the law of chastity &#8211; makes the
Savior&#8217;s suffering for our sins null and void and necessitates we pay the demands of justice
ourselves without qualifying for His mercy: <i>&#8220;For behold, I, God have suffered these things for
all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; but if they would not repent they must suffer
even as I&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 19:16-17).</p>
<p>Sin not properly and completely resolved is the only lasting tragedy from an eternal perspective.
Everything else &#8211; injustice, abuse, separation, sickness, death &#8211; is completely swallowed up
through the all-encompassing Atonement of our Lord once we depart mortality.</p>
<p>Elder Marion D. Hanks, an emeritus member of the Seventy, had a plaque on his office wall in
the Church Office Building that caught my attention during an interview. &#8220;To believe in God is
to know all the rules will be fair, and there will be wonderful surprises.&#8221; I love this statement and
testify of its validity. My wife, Shauna, has stitched it onto a number of pillows for people who
have endured suffering or lost loved ones to death. It rings sweet and true and hopeful. In some
of these dark and difficult moments I&#8217;ve seen and felt &#8211; as have many of you &#8211; the sacred support
of the Savior in rich abundance.</p>
<p>His love and blessings have been needed and given more times than I could name through the
years. I&#8217;m thankful for good parents who implemented faith in my heart, and for a wonderful
mother who taught me the power of prayer before she was baptized into The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>I would get bad earaches as a boy, and we would kneel at her bedside. She would ask Heavenly
Father to bring relief and comfort and sleep &#8211; and it seems to me as if they always came. Her
faith was tested and strengthened as she and my less-active father began the process of
conversion together and were taught by full-time missionaries. When the time came to commit to
baptism or go another direction, Mom put her trust in the Lord and in a spirit of fasting and
prayer opened the Book of Mormon randomly to find an answer. It opened to Alma Chapter 7,
and verse 15 seemed to jump off the page:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Come and fear not, and lay aside every sin which easily doth beset you &#8230; yea,
come and go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your
sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it
unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism</i> (Alma 7:15).</p>
<p>That was her answer in powerful fashion, and she followed through. Dad got things in order and
baptized her, and we were sealed as a family in the temple two years later. Their choices and
examples have provided a foundation of sacred support that has blessed our family and countless
others since, including many in South Africa where they served as missionaries.</p>
<p>A wonderful wife and companion picked up the tutoring when parents nudged me from the nest
at the appropriate time. Shauna is a woman of deep faith and inherent goodness who understands
spiritual support and how to receive and administer it. She just finished the Book of Mormon and
Doctrine and Covenants and is wrestling with Romans in the New Testament, which she&#8217;s read
multiple times. The sacred support and influence of righteous, virtuous women in the Lord&#8217;s
scheme of things cannot be overstated. Men and women need to support each other in our
divinely appointed duties and roles.</p>
<p>It is instructive that the risen Lord appeared first to &#8220;Mary Magdalene and the other Mary,&#8221;
according to the account in Matthew 28, then sent them to give the glorious news to his brethren.
President Joseph F. Smith&#8217;s Vision of the Redemption of the Dead speaks of the Savior&#8217;s visit to
the Spirit World between death and resurrection and notes an assembly of &#8220;great and mighty
ones,&#8221; including <i>&#8220;our glorious Mother Eve, with many of her faithful daughters who had lived
through the ages and worshiped the true and living God&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 138:38-39).</p>
<p>There should always to be sacred support for women and womanhood, especially by men of
Christ who need to treat daughters of God with the utmost of respect and affirmation. And
women need to conduct and clothe themselves accordingly and reciprocate respect and support
for the priesthood: <i>&#8220;Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man,
in the Lord&#8221;</i> (1 Corinthians 11:11). This is true of marriage and in the kingdom generally.
Everyone who is worthy has a seat at the banquet table and at ward and stake councils. We ought
to be extending heartfelt hands and invitations to those who are not worthy to help them get
there.</p>
<p>In speaking of exemplary women, I am reminded of three remarkable young sister missionaries
with whom we had the privilege of serving in Kentucky and who have since passed away. All
three had the Spirit in their lives in rich abundance. All three were worthy and ready when
&#8220;called home&#8221; at such an early age. They provide powerful examples of being &#8220;justified&#8221; before
the Father and receiving His support, which simply means the Holy Ghost is active in our lives
so our ordinances and covenants are in full force. Thus the Savior can justify our lives and
efforts as our advocate with the Father &#8211; and his grace is sufficient for us to receive eternal life.</p>
<p>Sister Shellise Sharp was killed near Boise when her vehicle was hit broadside by a speeding car.
She was a great missionary who helped teach a woman in our home who Sister Cannon
contacted at the Kroger bakery. They had a sweet experience working with this woman who
ended up joining the Church.</p>
<p>I mentioned how Heavenly Father is in charge and knows the end from the beginning. Sister
Sharp was with us when we spoke in sacrament meeting upon returning home in July 2002. She
literally glowed with a radiance that was somewhat surreal and unearthly, which Shauna and I
discussed on our drive home. Eight days later, we understood why. Though we, her family and
friends mourned &#8211; and still mourn &#8211; her passing when we gathered for her funeral, the Spirit bore
witness concerning how prepared she was to move on.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t have the privilege of having Sister Josie Johnson in our mission for long. She was
assigned temporarily to Kentucky while awaiting her visa to serve overseas. But she was one
who, when arriving at the mission home with her companion, instantly made a profoundly
positive impact. My wife and I just looked at each other and thought, &#8220;Wow. What strings can
we pull at Church headquarters to have her assigned to us permanently?&#8221; Of course, that wasn&#8217;t
the plan, and a few weeks later she was off to Belgium. She left a huge imprint for good on her
area in Kentucky and upon her associates. We were heartbroken to learn she was hit and killed
while bicycling in one of the canyons above Salt Lake City a few months ago.</p>
<p>Sister Alexandria Wagley was another incredible missionary who inexplicably was diagnosed
with lung cancer shortly after her return home. Her cancer was one of those seemingly random
bad things that happen to great people. No habits in her life could have predicted it. Sister
Wagley endured chemotherapy, radiation, several hospitalizations and finally succumbed on
September 28 of this year.</p>
<p>In the words of her parents: &#8220;We will always miss Alexandria. She was an amazing person.
We&#8217;re amazed that Heavenly Father entrusted her to our care for 29 years. What an undeserved
blessing that was! How we loved her! Throughout this whole ordeal she never complained, nor
did she whine, &#8216;Why me?&#8217; In fact, she was so uncomplaining that we had no idea how near to
death she was. We know that the spirit world is a happier place with our sunshine girl there.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know it is, too, and reiterate in these three circumstances &#8211; and in so many others &#8211; that &#8220;to
believe in God is to know all the rules will be fair, and there will be wonderful surprises.&#8221; There
is hope. There is a life &#8211; everlasting life and, if faithful like these three, eternal life &#8211; beyond this
veil of tears thanks to what Jesus has done for all of us.</p>
<p>The promise in Isaiah is sweet and sure: <i>&#8220;He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God
will wipe away tears from off all faces&#8221;</i> (Isaiah 25:8). I like to believe that drying of tears is
something the Savior will do personally, for as Jacob points out, <i>&#8220;the keeper of the gate is the
Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there&#8221; </i>(2 Nephi 9:41).</p>
<p>I testify of that and of Him and His chosen servants, the living oracles Bishop H. David Burton
spoke of in a devotional here a few weeks ago. I love and sustain President Gordon B. Hinckley
and all those called to direct the Lord&#8217;s work at every level. It&#8217;s a blessing to serve in the BYU-Idaho 2<sup>nd</sup> Stake under a sweet and inspired stake president and with other dedicated leaders who
provide strong spiritual support and leadership.</p>
<p>President Hinckley has challenged us to do our best, but I think sometimes we can rationalize a
bit into thinking we&#8217;re giving our all when we probably have much more to give. He clarified his
thoughts and encouragement at a worldwide satellite training broadcast.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I have been quoted as saying, &#8216;Do the best you can.&#8217; But I want to emphasize that
it be the very best. We are too prone to be satisfied with mediocre performance.
We are capable of doing so much better. Brethren and sisters, we must get on our
knees and plead with the Lord for help and strength and direction. We must then
stand on our feet and move forward</i> (&#8220;Standing Strong and Immovable,&#8221; Jan. 10,
2004, Satellite Training Broadcast).</p>
<p>Does anyone exemplify doing one&#8217;s best, moving forward with faith and urgency, and trusting in
the Lord more than our beloved prophet and leader?</p>
<p>I recall being in Hawaii on a <i>Church News </i>assignment in February 1996. President and Sister
Hinckley had gone there for several events in connection with the Polynesian Cultural Center
and to fulfill other responsibilities. I was privileged to report on the &#8220;Aloha&#8221; outpouring given
them. It was a delightful experience.</p>
<p>Before returning home, I attended a session in the Hawaii Temple. President David Hanneman
was a gracious host and invited me to dress in a room adjacent to his office. He said President
Hinckley had been there the previous day for a session, and pointed out the white socks worn by
the prophet that were still there. I dressed and realized I had forgotten my temple socks.
President Hanneman said he would get me a pair, then he smiled and asked: &#8220;Maybe you would
like to wear President Hinckley&#8217;s?&#8221; I said it would be an honor &#8211; and it was.</p>
<p>More important than following in a prophet&#8217;s socks is following his footsteps and example and
in doing our very best. I testify in doing so there is safety, security and spiritual support that
bring peace and joy in this life and eternal life in the world to come.</p>

</p>
<p>I want to thank President Bednar and the administration for their inspired leadership of this
wonderful University and for the maybe less than inspired invitation given to me to speak.  It is
not often that anyone voluntarily asks a lawyer to speak &#8211; it usually costs too much.</p>
<p>This is really quite an overwhelming sight and a humbling invitation to address this group.  I
recently argued a case before the Utah Supreme Court and this is by far more intimidating and
daunting.  Before the Supreme Court I had only to advocate the rightfulness of my client&#8217;s cause,
here I have been asked to speak and edify by the spirit &#8211; a truly more compelling challenge.</p>
<p>In the moments that I have here with you I would like to talk to you about a subject that is very
tender and personal to me, and upon reflection probably very challenging for you also.  At this
particular time between the wonderful holidays of Thanksgiving, which we have only just
finished with the feeling of fulness that it leaves, and Christmas; in this time of acknowledging
and counting blessings and recognizing wonderful gifts that have been given to us, I would like
to talk about a group of important blessings that we have or are receiving though often times
they are not appreciated or even especially welcomed &#8211; these are our trials and adversities.  In
particular I want to talk about remaining faithful in times of adversity.  In addressing this subject 
I would like to offer a simple but much maligned scripture, as instructive or a key to successfully
making adversities into the blessings that the Lord promises.</p>
<p>Since I notice that you all have your scriptures I will give you the reference to this simple
scripture now and let you look it up and maybe puzzle over it and what I could possibly say
about it that would link it to the world of adversities.  The scripture is 1 Nephi 2:15.</p>
<p>In addressing the topic of remaining faithful in times of adversity I want to try to address a
couple of different aspects of this topic.  First, the WHY question &#8211; why do we have trials and
adversities.  The second is if we understand the WHY, will it make any difference.   And finally,
the HOW.  When faced with adversity HOW do we remain faithful.</p>
<p>First &#8211; the WHY.  Why do we have adversity?  Why do we have trials and why are they so
painfully and discouragingly hard?  Elder Faust in his most recent Conference talk shed some
considerable light on this subject when he posed and answered the following questions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Why was I born with physical or mental limitations?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">What did I do to deserve this heartache?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Why hasn't the Lord answered our prayers the way we wished?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">[Why do] people who have done some very bad things, . . . seem to have
everything they want or need?</p>
<p>After posing these questions Elder Faust then answered the question by quoting Dr. Arthur
Wentworth Hewitt, apparently an expert of some renown, who said, with what I believe was a
great deal of candor: &#8220;First: I don't know. Second: We may not be as innocent as we think. Third:
. . . I believe it is because [The Lord] . . . loves us so much more than He loves our happiness&#8221;
(<i>&#8220;Where Do I Stand,&#8221;</i> 174 General Conference).</p>
<p>While it appears particularly difficult to tackle the Why question head on &#8211; who am I to go
where Elder Faust was so careful to tread &#8211;  let me try to address the WHY question a little
differently by drawing some insights from some rather obvious observation about adversities.</p>
<p>The first observation if that while the reasons for our adversities may not be immediately known
or discoverable, this life is nonetheless full of them both great and small.  None of us are exempt,
and none of us will be blessed with too few.  For example, the chilling but prophetic words
found inscribed on  the crypt of the infamous Black Knight entombed in Westminster Abby in
London, speaks of the certainty of pain and loss in this life.  It reads &#8220;As you are, I once was, As
I am, you will be.&#8221;   As an aside it is interesting how an eternal perspective has taken this rather
grizzly prediction of physical doom and turned it to a prophesy of infinite increase when
President Lorenzo Snow offered his famous couplet: &#8220;As man is, God once was, As God is, Man
may become.&#8221;</p>
<p>But again let me state the obvious; in our lives: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">*Everyone at some time will be separate from their loved ones, i.e., separated
from mother, father, husband, wife, children or friends, by death &#8211; either ours or
theirs; </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">*Everyone of us and all of our loved ones will suffer life ending injuries or
disease;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">*Everyone will suffer disappointment because of poor choices of our own making
or the choices of  loved ones;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">*And finally, at some point in our lives, all of us will be faced with the deep
loneliness that comes because of separation from loved ones.  Remember the pain
of separation for those who have passed is no less than for those who have been
left behind.  In Doctrine and Covenants 138: 50 we learn that in such separation
the dead <i>&#8220;look upon the long absence of their spirits from their bodies as a
bondage.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Through these observations, I am not trying to be unduly negative or morose.  I just want to
point out that an essential element of this life is that regardless of how good we are or how hard
we try to do the right things there will be trials, and they will be very, very difficult.</p>
<p>O.K.  So now I have stated the obvious there are trials and there is pain &#8211; we are truly living in
&#8220;veil of tears.&#8221;  The other obvious observation that I can make is that the effect that these trials
have on us is <span style="font-weight: bold">exactly, exactly</span> what our Heavenly Father wants.</p>
<p>For example, we know from the Book of Mormon that through adversities our Father in Heaven
wants us to know opposition in all things.  In 2 Nephi 2:15  we read: <i>&#8220;it must needs be that there
was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet
and the other bitter.&#8221;</i>  When you have a minute go back and reflect on this scripture and notice
as between the &#8220;forbidden fruit&#8221; and the &#8220;tree of life&#8221; which is sweet and which is bitter.  While
the fruit of the tree of life is described by Adam and Eve as  <i>&#8220;most precious and desirable&#8221;</i> (1
Nephi 15:36) it is not described as &#8220;sweet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scriptures also teach us that the Lord wants a people <i>&#8220;tried in all things&#8221; 
		</i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 136:31), how specifically will we be tried?  He tells us, <i>&#8220;Nevertheless the Lord seeth
fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith&#8221;</i> (Mosiah 23:21).  Some of
us, Elder Neal A. Maxwell, has said will have &#8220;trials to <i>pass through,</i> while still others have
allotments they are to <i>live with.</i>  Paul, the great apostle, for example, lived with his 
		<i>&#8216;thorn in the
flesh&#8217; </i>(2 Corinthians 12:7)&#8221; (Conference Talk, &#8220;Plow in Hope,&#8221; April, 2001).</p>
<p>Elder Maxwell goes on to explain</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>that mortality presents us with numerous opportunities to cope with those of life's
challenges which are</i> &#8216;common to man[kind]&#8217; (1 Corinthians 10:13). 
		<i>In addition,
there are also our customized trials such as experiencing illness, . . ., persecution,
betrayal, irony, poverty, false witness, [and] unreciprocated love, . . . . If endured
well, </i>&#8216;all these things&#8217;<i> can be for our good and can &#8216;greatly enlarge the soul,&#8217; by
excavating the soul we are promised an enlarged capacity for joy </i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 122:7; 121:42).</p>
<p>Important in all of this is that our Heavenly Father knows what he want for us and from us and
the trials we are given are intended to create the kind of person that the Lord expects us to be.  It
is the fact that he knows us and sees us that makes our trials &#8211; while not any more
understandable &#8211; maybe more acceptable.</p>
<p>We know from modern revelation that our Heavenly Father knows the beginning from the end (3
Nephi 9:18, Doctrine and Covenants 35:1) &#8211; he knows how everything turns out, how we turn
out.  Since he already knows how all of this turns out why do we have to go through this?  Let
me submit that these experiences reveal who we are and they reveal the import of what the Lord
wants of us and for us.  For <i>&#8220;the trial of [our] faith . . . [is] much more precious than gold that
perisheth, though it be tried with fire.. . . &#8221;</i> (1 Peter 1:7) In coming to know ourselves our trials
are the best teachers, since such learning is very, very personal.  As my father used to say,  &#8220;The
greatest pain know to medical science is your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 13, Paul describes for us the challenging nature of personal growth. He begins
in verse 11 by saying:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a
child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</i></p>
<p>Then in the all important and oft quoted verse 12 he explains:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part;
but then shall I know even as also I am known.</i></p>
<p>To better understand this important scripture, lets go through it line by line and reflect on it a
little more carefully.</p>
<p>We know that we are here to grow and to experience all of the joys and pains of growth.  This
applies to both our physically and spiritually growth.  As verse 11 indicates we move from being
a child to an adult and in doing so we put off certain childish things &#8211; as you know from your
own experience such growth is neither easy nor always fun.  But we know it is absolutely
necessary.</p>
<p>Verse 12 is often quoted but maybe not well understood. Again it reads: 
		<i>&#8220;For now we see
through a glass darkly.&#8221;</i> Let me stop there.  Strangely this is usually all of this verse that is
quoted and the rest is left out.  This part of the scripture is usually interpreted as an observation
concerning the great difficulty we have seeing or understanding the world around us thus leaving
us to blunder and grope through the darkness.  While those sentiments may certainly be true, I
don&#8217;t think that this is what this scripture is talking about.</p>
<p>In this scripture it is important to understand 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">what</span> the &#8220;we&#8221; are looking at.  The scripture says
that <i>&#8220;For now we see through a <span style="font-weight: bold">glass</span> darkly.&#8221;</i>  What is a glass?  Since the King James version
of the Bible draws from 16<sup>th</sup> Century English, think of how the word glass is used in English
stories such as &#8220;Alice through the looking Glass.&#8221;  A glass in this instance is not a window with
the implication that we are looking out on the world  &#8211; but it is a mirror.  Thus, in this scripture
Paul is not talking about the inherent obscurity of the world but how difficult it is to see and
understand ourselves for it is us that we are looking at in the mirror and it is us that we are trying
to know.</p>
<p>With that understanding let&#8217;s look at the rest of verse 12.  Paul goes on to describe more about
coming to know ourselves when he says<i>&#8220;but then face to face: now I know in part, but then shall
I know even as I am know.&#8221; </i>In our struggles to see ourselves we only get glimpses and see
pieces of ourselves as we try to perceive who we are in the opaque and rough reflection provided
by an imperfect world.  While now we only know bits and pieces since only &#8220;part&#8221; is made
available to us &#8211; here is the good part - <i>&#8220;then shall I know even as I am known.&#8221;</i>  The good part;
the important part, is that we are known!  Our Heavenly Father has his eye on us.  He knows us
and he knows us perfectly.  And we are promised that we will come to know ourselves, see
ourselves, as our Heavenly Father knows and sees us.  To know that we are known and known
perfectly is so very important when we are faced with truly troubling trials.  To know that the
trials are part of who we are or who we are becoming lends an import to the experience that can
make them into the blessings that they are meant to be.</p>
<p>To help understand a little better the importance of having a creator who clearly sees and knows
our trials let me give you an example that I thought of that was helpful to me. 
		</p>
<p>I love wood.  I love its feel, its smell, and its texture.  And I love to carve in it even though I am
not particularly skilled.  Carving or sculpturing something out of wood or any other material for
that matter is an interesting and difficult process.  Michelangelo was once asked how he
sculptured his amazing statuary.  He responded provocatively by saying &#8220;I see the angel in the
marble and carved until I have set it free&#8221;
(www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/m/michelangelo.html). While it is easy for a
Michelangelo to be so eloquently in describing such a difficult process in such an off-hand
manner, his comment is helpful in that it emphasizes probably the most important part of the
creative process.  To free the angel from the marble the sculptor must clearly see what the
material contains.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Vision</span> therefor is the starting point of the creative process.  
		</p>
<p>Again I indicated I love wood.  Take a look at this piece of beautiful golden mahogany, which
comes from Hondorus and this piece of red mahogany which comes from the Phillipines.  Both
of these pieces of wood are exceptional, if not perfect.  They are flawless, and they are solid &#8211;
not joined or glued together.  They are also exceptional because of their size.  The first is 24
inches wide which means that it had to come from a tree that is over twelve feet in circumference
and the other is 36 inches wide meaning it came from a tree over 18 feet around.  Both of these
pieces are very beautiful just as they are.  But what do you see in them?  Well, this is what I saw
in one and what I am seeing in the other.</p>
<p>Now, lets be a bit anthropomorphic for a minute and think of the wood&#8217;s feelings.  What does
this carving process feel like to the wood?  Carving is a violent process.  In this case I pretty well
tortured these otherwise beautiful pieces of wood to get them to where they are.  To get to the
vision that I saw I had to remove a fair amount of what would appear to be perfectly good wood
&#8211; even  perfectly beautiful wood.  To the wood, I can imagine that my cutting, gouging, scraping
and sanding was exceedingly painful, and might even have appeared to be somewhat random,
arbitrary, completely unnecessary, or even just mean.  But the problem is the wood and I did not
necessarily share the same vision of how things should turn out.</p>
<p>I am sure that you can follow my analogue.  We are beautiful even exquisite material from which
the Lord has a plan to make us into something.  In our case we even know what we are to be &#8211;
beautiful sons and daughters full of perfection.  One thing that we don&#8217;t really fully appreciate &#8211;
like the wood &#8211; we do not know have a clear view of what the end result is to look like and we
do not always appreciate how difficult and painful the process of freeing the angel really is.</p>
<p>Elder Hugh B. Brown reports the following personal story that illustrates the point I am trying to
make.  He states:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I was living up in Canada. I had purchased a farm. It was run-down. I went out
one morning and saw a currant bush. It had grown up over six feet high. It was
going all to wood. There were no blossoms and no currants. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I was raised on a fruit farm in Salt Lake before I went to Canada, and I knew
what ought to happen to that currant bush. So I got some pruning shears and
clipped it back until there was nothing left but stumps. It was just coming
daylight, and I thought I saw on top of each of these little stumps what appeared
to be a tear, and I thought the currant bush was crying. I looked at it and smiled
and said,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;What are you crying about?&#8221; 
		</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>You know, I thought I heard that currant bush say this: &#8220;How could you do this to
me? I was making such wonderful growth. I was almost as big as the shade tree
and the fruit tree that are inside the fence, and now you have cut me down. Every
plant in the garden will look down on me because I am not as big as they. How
could you do this to me? I thought you were the gardener here.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what he thought he heard the currant bush say, and he thought it so much that he
answered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>[He] said, &#8220;Look, little currant bush, I am the gardener here, and I know what I
want you to be. I didn&#8217;t intend you to be a fruit tree or a shade tree. I want you to
be a currant bush, and someday, little currant bush, when you are laden with
fruit, you are going to say, &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Gardener, for loving me enough to
cut me down. Thank you, Mr. Gardener.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Years passed and Elder Brown found himself in England in the Army and in line for a very
important and prestigious  promotion.  He was wrongly and rudely denied that promotion and he
reports that as he returned to his camp on the train with a broken heart, with bitterness in his
soul, every click of the wheels on the rails seemed to say, &#8220;You are a failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he got to his tent, he was so bitter that he threw his cap on his cot, clenched his fists, and
shook them at heaven, and said, &#8220;How could you do this to me, God? I have done everything I
could do to measure up. There is nothing that I could have done &#8211; that I should have done &#8211; that I
haven&#8217;t done. How could you do this to me?  At that moment he reports that he heard a voice,
and recognized the tone of the voice. He said, &#8220;It was my own voice, and the voice said, &#8220;I am
the gardener here. I know what I want you to do.&#8221; He reports that the bitterness went out of his
soul, and he fell on my knees by the cot to ask forgiveness for his ungratefulness and bitterness.
While kneeling there praying for forgiveness, he heard a song being sung in an adjoining tent by
a group of LDS soldiers.  He heard them sing</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But  if, by a still, small voice he calls</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>To paths that I do not know,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I&#8217;ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I&#8217;ll go where you want me to go 
		</i>(Hymns, 270)<br /></p>
<p>Fifty years later in telling this story Elder Brown said that he felt even more deeply, &#8220;Thank you,
Mr. Gardener, for cutting me down, for loving me enough to hurt me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joseph Smith described his refining process a little differently, he said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I am like a huge, rough stone . . . and the only polishing I get is when some corner
gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else, striking with
accelerated force. . . . Thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the
quiver of the Almighty</i> (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph
Fielding Smith [1976], 304).</p>
<p>As to the pain inherent in this cutting, sculpturing, and polishing process Elder Maxwell has
given us a great perspective.  He said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>In those moments when we feel the pain which is a necessary part of the plan of
happiness, we can remember that there was an ancient time when that plan was
first unveiled.  Then the perceptive among us voted not secretly, but audibly &#8211; by
shouting for joy!  Let us not go back on those feelings now &#8211; for we saw more
clearly then what we are experiencing now!</i> (&#8220;The Neal A. Maxwell Quote
Book,&#8221; p. 248)</p>
<p>O.K., so adversity and pain are part of a very important and personal plan.  Does knowing and
understand that really help?  Surprisingly it does.  This is what life is about &#8211; and we don&#8217;t get
out of life without living it.</p>
<p>Now to turn to the final question, HOW do we remain faithful when faced with adversity.  If we
understand that our Heaven Father has a plan for us and we know and believe that he &#8220;will
support us in our trials . . . troubles . . . and afflictions. . .&#8221; (Alma 36:3) &#8211; what does he give to
help us?  The scriptures are replete with stories and examples of individuals that are put to severe
trials.  Many have been asked to travel in real or personal wildernesses.  The reality of the
wilderness and its symbolic value is drawn upon heavily in the scriptures, and is often repeated. 
Adam and Eve were given their wilderness in the form of this &#8220;lone and dreary world,&#8221; (&#8220;The
House of the Lord,&#8221; 1968 pp. 83-84).  Abraham escaped the civilized world of Ur of the
Chaldees and wander in the wilderness of Mesopotamia his whole life; Moses with the children
of Israel wander for 40 years in the wilderness until being lead to the promised land and then he
was denied entrance; and finally Lehi and his family wandered for eight years in the wilderness
before finding the Land Bountiful, and then the promised land.  We too have been given personal
wildernesses to negotiate.  For most of us it is not only life in an increasingly unforgiving and
secular world but it also contains the &#8220;slings and arrows of outrageous fortune&#8221; (Hamlet (III, i,
56-61).</p>
<p>In our wildernesses like all wildernesses the elements are 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">as</span> rough, inhospitable and forbidding
as any desolate place on the earth.  The Lord knows this.  But He has given us a simple symbol
readily understood by our nomadic ancestors of the help that he can and has provided for us in
our wildernesses.  It is found in 1 Nephi 2:15.  If you are like me this is one of the first scripture
that you memorized from the Book of Mormon.  Yes, it is <i>&#8220;And my father dwelt in a tent.&#8221;</i>  Why
would Nephi report something so silly or trivial in such an important book where he constantly
claims that writing was difficult and space was at a premium, and what does this have to do with
remaining faithful in times of adversity?  To help tie all of this together I need to make reference
to another story.</p>
<p>This story is one of my favorites.  It is by the Noble prize winning author Isaac Beshiva Singer. 
Isaac Beshiva Singer is a wonderful, spiritually insightful Jewish writer who sets many of his
stories in 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century Poland among the orthodox Jews.  His stories usually explore the
problem of maintaining faith in a pervasively secular world.  In this particular story entitled
&#8220;Joy&#8221; he tells of a very devote Rabbi who through a series of terrible Job-like events loses all
that he truly loves &#8211; all of his children.  It is reported that when the Rabbi&#8217;s youngest daughter
dies he is so shattered by her loss that he can not even follow her Hearst to her grave.  These
losses challenge and overwhelm him and the unimaginable happens, he loses his faith.  His great
learning offers no answers as to why these things have happened.  Even though his faith is
shaken, remarkably the Rabbi does not curse God or his circumstance, but he is humble and
filled with <span style="text-decoration: underline">piety</span>.  Piety is an important word in this story and means the a desire to do the things
that one knows are right and good.  For example the Rabbi continues to read the Torah even
though he concedes that at times he feels he understands less and less.  He continues to go to the
ritual bath.  He observes all of the commandments, and rituals and he becomes even more
devoted to relieving human suffering by giving to the poor including selling all that he has &#8211; for
this many of his erstwhile followers consider him to be a fool.  Yet he persists in doing all of
these things because, he reports, these are things that he can understand.</p>
<p>Near the end of his life his youngest daughter appears to him to bring him home, and in an
instant all is made clear and his faith is restored.  But before he dies he is permitted to spend one
more holiday  with his people.  At this last festival he is described as celebrating it with more
passion and more devotion than he had ever celebrated before.  As part of the celebration there is
an important scene where the Rabbi explains how his faith was restored.  In this scene it
describes the Jewish custom of the Rabbi commenting on a scripture or explaining the meaning
of some obscure verse.  I would like to read to you this section of the story:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">The rabbi took up the question of why the moon is obscured on Rosh Hashannah. 
The answer is that on Rosh Hashannah one prays for life, and life mean free
choice, and freedom is Mystery.  If one knew the truth how could there be
freedom?  If hell and paradise were in the middle of the marketplace, everyone
would be a saint.  Of all the blessings bestowed on man the greatest lies in the fact
that God&#8217;s face is forever hidden from him.  Men are the children of the Highest,
and the Almighty plays hide and seek with them.  He hides His face and the
children seek him while they have faith that he exists.  But what if, God forbid,
one loses faith?  The wicked live on denials; denial in themselves are also a faith
in evildoing, and from it one can draw strength for the body.  But if the pious man
loses his faith, the truth is shown to him and he is recalled.  This is the meaning of
the words, &#8216;When a man dies in a tent:&#8217; when the pious man falls from his rank
and becomes like the wicked, without . . . shelter, then a light shines from above,
and all doubt ceases. . . .&#8221; (&#8220;Joy&#8221; <i>The Collected Stories of Isaac Beshiva Singer,
		</i>pp. 29-37).</p>
<p>Because the Rabbi was pious, that is, he refused to abandon the protective trappings afforded by
the rituals and practices of his religion and continued to do all of the things that he could, he
stayed where he could be found, he was protected from the wilderness of unbelief and he was
redeemed.</p>
<p>Let me try to examine the symbol of the protection afforded by a tent in the wilderness as it
might relate to our spiritual lives.  Those of you that have spent a night outside in freezing
weather or in a fierce storm know how important a tent can be.  You probably have marveled, as
have I, at what a couple of millimeters of nylon or canvas can mean in such a circumstance. 
Those couple of millimeters of nylon may seem pretty insubstantial but you know or have
learned from your experience that if you are caught without that protection the difference can be
the difference between life and death or at the very lease comfort and real misery.  In out
spiritual lives we can and do have similar fierce storms or freezing nights and certainly need
similar protection from the buffetings of unbelief.</p>
<p>For our spiritual lives the Lord has provided us literally and figuratively with protective
trappings.  Like a tent the physical trappings of the gospel might at times feel only paper thin or
appear to be insubstantial in dealing with the buffetings of the storms of a secular world, but I
want you to know that those physical trappings nonetheless have the power to protect. 
		</p>
<p>While we know and understand that there are certain saving ordinances in the gospel &#8211; baptism,
the Gift of the Holy Ghost, the endowment, and marriage that can bring us unto salvation, let me
suggest that there are also certain saving practices that provide us shelter and leave us in a place
where we can be both protected and redeemed</p>
<p>For example, we know that there are times that <i>&#8220;the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak&#8221; (</i>Matthew 26:41), but I feel that there are also times when &#8220;the spirit is weak but the flesh
is indeed willing.&#8221;  When the Lord made us of both spirit and flesh He knew that there would be
times when the spirit and the flesh would have to support and lift each other up.  There are times
that the physical rituals of daily scripture study, thoughtful pray, devote attendance of Church
meetings, reaching beyond ourselves to serve those in need and doing every other good thing are
things that the flesh can do to help tutor and buoy up a flagging spirit.</p>
<p>In those times of spiritual storm these things, while seeming insignificant in the face of such
challenges, can and do shelter us from the brutality of the storm that would have us blown 
		<i>&#8220;by
every wind of doctrine</i>&#8221; (Ephesians 4:14). Continuing to abide in these trappings also has the
valuable effect, like it did with the Rabbi in Singer&#8217;s story, of keeping us close and within the
fold were the Lord&#8217;s spirit can work on us to reveal what we need to understand and so that our
faith can be restored.  Putting off those trappings and wandering from the protection of the tent
leaves us without shelter and subjects us to the full intensity of the storm.  I know that at least to
some degree you have all felt the effect of the protection of the tent.  I am sure that there are
times when the press and demands of the world have caused you to put off the simple rituals of
daily scripture study, prayer and meaningful church participation.  At those times haven&#8217;t you
felt unprotected, vulnerable, alone or even lost?  It is also at these times that the trials and
adversities that life has for us are all the more confusing, hard and harsh.</p>
<p>While the image of the tent and its protection is one that may not readily speak to us in our
comfortable surroundings, and may be equally hard to understand in the context of trials and
adversities, the need for protection when stressed with challenges is crucial in making adversities
into the blessings they can be.</p>
<p>I want to leave you with the challenge and the blessing that the Lord left with Israel at the time
of Isaiah.  Again it draws on the image of the tent and the promises that it invokes.  The Lord
commanded Israel to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy
habitations . . . strength . . . thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou
mayest no more be confounded that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he
has made unto thee. . .  may be fulfilled (see Moroni 10:31, Isaiah 54:2).</p>
<p>I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>The Special Musical number, <i>Take My Life and Let It Be Consecrated Unto Thee</i> became our
Missionary Hymn (after being taught to us by Elder and Sister Hafen, who formerly presided
over Ricks College). It describes a Missionary&#8217;s two years of discipleship service to the Lord.</p>
<p>As I think of the consecration of missionaries, I can&#8217;t help but think of one of our elders who
came into the mission field leaving a terminally ill mother at home, with the anticipation that she
probably wouldn&#8217;t be there when he completed his mission. This elder loved his mother very
much and promised her that he would be a good missionary and complete his mission. Shortly
after arriving in the mission field, he fell and broke his foot. Fearing that he might have to return
home for it to heal and fearing this might break his promise to his mom, he determined to not tell
anybody about it and for two years he limped and hobbled on a foot that required surgery when
he did return home. &#8220;<i>Take my feet and let them be, swift and beautiful for thee . . . &#8221; 
		</i>That&#8217;s a
beautiful phrase and I believe it describes why the Prophet, Isaiah, said, &#8220;<i>How beautiful upon the
mountains are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things . . . &#8221;</i></p>
<p>My wife and I are deeply humbled to be here today to speak to you. If you haven&#8217;t sensed it
already, may I assure you that a Mission President&#8217;s wife is the heart and soul of the mission.
Certainly my wife was for our mission in Albania. </p>
<p>I once was involved in arranging for the speakers for our devotionals. I know of the greatness of
those who have occupied this spot before me and of the preparation they made to say something
of importance for you. Please know that my wife and I are truly humbled to be here today.</p>
<p>As mentioned, my wife and I had the privilege of serving our mission in Albania. For us, it was
we think, the very best mission to which we could have been called. When we received our call
from President Thomas S. Monson, we knew little about Albania and I would guess that most of
you don&#8217;t know much about it either. May I share a &#8220;thumbnail&#8221; sketch of what we learned about
this country &amp; its people</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-Albania is a small country of about 3.5 million people &#8211; that&#8217;s 230 miles long
and up to 115 miles wide.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-It&#8217;s a located across from Italy, above Greece and below Kosovo and Serbia.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-It&#8217;s made up of 70% Muslims, 20% Greek Orthodox, and 10% Catholics.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-It is the poorest of the Central European countries.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-Albania was the last of the Communist countries to fall.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-It was the only country in the world where Atheism was the national religion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-Communism robbed the Albanian&#8217;s of its earlier religious roots and of God &#8211; In
fact, it was a crime punishable by years in prison for Catholics to cross
themselves or for people to mention God or Christ or Mohammed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-The Albanian Communist government destroyed over 1,800 churches and
mosques and executed hundreds of Muslim clerics and Christian priests.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-The church sent the 1<sup>st</sup> proselyting missionaries (4 of them) into Albania in 1992,
shortly after sending senior Humanitarian missionaries into the country.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-When the Missionaries would find people with a spark of religious interest in
their souls, they would find&#8211;just like with the 2,000 stripling warriors who said
they were taught by their mothers, the Albanians would say, &#8220;We were taught by
our Grandmothers&#8221; We heard that many times.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">-Today there are over 1,300 members of the church in this small country &#8211; and
they are wonderful people whom we grew to love and appreciate.</p>
<p>In the opening devotional message to the students last August, before his call to the Quorum of
the Twelve, Elder Bednar taught the concept that BYU-I is a &#8220;Disciple Preparation Center&#8221; and
that our focus must be to help students&#8217; develop a disciple&#8217;s faith that is focused in our Savior,
the Son of God</p>
<p>In his opening Devotional address to the students of then Ricks College on August 29, 2000,
Elder Bednar taught:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The tendency of the natural man or woman in each of us is to expect first the
evidence of faith before we receive and act upon the assurance [of faith]. This
false pattern is summarized in the statements of individuals who say: &#8220;Show me a
sign, and I will believe&#8221; or &#8220;Explain the reasons, and then I will follow.&#8221; The
Lord's pattern, however, is quite different. Seeing is not believing; rather,
believing is seeing.</i></p>
<p>Elder Bednar then said,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I imagine many of you may be like me; I would rather have the evidence before I
act . . . Imagine a beam of light that surrounds us. God instructs, &#8220;Take a step
into the darkness,&#8221; and we respond, &#8220;First, move the light and then I will take the
step.&#8221; God instructs again, &#8220;You take the step and then the light will move.&#8221;
Faith is the assurance that precedes the act which ultimately yields the evidence.</i></p>
<p>Elder Bednar then demonstrated this principle from this pulpit, by having the hall lights
darkened (totally&#8211;and I can assure you it got dark in here) except for a spot light directly
overhead that illuminated him alone at the pulpit. Then he stepped out of the beam into the
darkness and said <i>&#8220;As we walk to the edge of the light, I testify and promise that the light will
move.&#8221;</i> Brothers and Sisters, seconds then passed in darkness and then the overhead spotlight
shifted and illuminated him. It was a very graphic demonstration of God&#8217;s instruction that we
must first take the step and then the light will follow.</p>
<p>May I add my testimony of this by illustrating an example I witnessed in Albania of this great
principle? At each of our zone conferences it was our practice to have the district leaders stand a
report on his districts&#8217; service projects for the previous weeks. At one particular zone
conference, a district leader came forward and then for his report he asked his entire district to
stand, face the missionaries, and then show them their hands. As they did, we all quickly saw
that they were all covered with blisters. Then he reported that their service project for the past
month had been to dig a well for one of the poor member families in Elbasan who had no
running water in their home. He then told of how the senior missionary couple there had seen
their dilemma and found that they were hauling water each day from a neighbor a hundred yards
or so away who had a well. After doing some investigation, he found out how deep the well was
and he concluded that if they could dig down that far, they could dig a well for this family&#8211;and
so they had begun.</p>
<p>When the district leader reported that day, they were down about 12 feet. Initially, when they
had started digging the 6' feet in diameter well the digging was relatively easy. Two elders dug
for a while and then traded off with two others. As the hole got deeper, they soon couldn&#8217;t throw
the dirt up and over the edge. Then they devised a system to fill buckets tied to a rope that was
thrown over a log. When the bucket was filled, they would hoist it up where the two elders on
top would take it and haul the dirt away to dump. It was quite a project.</p>
<p>You know, when you get down 15' or so, that is a deep hole. At 16' they hit solid rock. That&#8217;s
pretty discouraging when you have dug that long. 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">How great is your faith at a time like this?</span> The
senior missionary was discouraged, but not dismayed. After some searching, he found the one
man in the little city who had a jack hammer. However, after the man broke two bits while
drilling, he refused to go any further. <span style="text-decoration: underline">How does this affect your faith?</span> With a home made sledge
hammer they continued on chipping away using the sledge and old railroad spikes. 
		</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, How is your faith when you get to 20' &amp; you&#8217;re still in rock with no water?
How about 25'? It was at about 26' when they came out one morning and found the rock in the
bottom of the well was wet. They broke through the rock that day, went down another foot, and
the next day at 27 feet, they came out to find a foot of water in their well.</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, true disciples of Christ must have faith to step into the darkness knowing
the light will follow. They must be willing to dig down 27' knowing they&#8217;ll find water even when
digging in solid rock. This Rock came from the depths of that well. It is my constant reminder of
the well and the faith it took to dig it.</p>
<p>Elder Bednar also explained that a disciple&#8217;s faith is a spiritual gift and that it dispels fear. Can I
tell you how I know that faith can dispel fear? To do so I want to tell you about Agim Shehu.
Agim&#8217;s wife, Aisha, joined the church a few years ago. Her husband was a very spiritual man,
but a stroke had left him partially paralyzed and he had been unable to leave his little fifth floor
apartment for the past 6 &#189; years. I first heard of Agim from Sister Shehu when I met her one day
coming into the mission office to enlarge some pages of the Book of Mormon for Agim to read.
Following up on an invitation to visit Agim, Sister Kinghorn and a couple of elders were able to
officially meet him at their apartment a few days later. Brothers and Sisters, I wish I could
adequately describe their humble little apartment. Maybe I can&#8217;t do that, but I can tell you about
the tremendous spirit that exists in his home.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for me to determine that Agim had a beautiful testimony of the gospel. I told
him so and I told him that he needed to be baptized. I remember his response. How he would
love to, he said, but he just couldn&#8217;t leave his apartment. With the stroke, his steps were reduced
to slow, difficult shuffle of only an inch or so per step and they lived on the 5<sup>th</sup> floor. I think
Sister Kinghorn wondered about my sanity at the time, but I told Agim to look at those two big,
strong elders&#8211;I said, they can carry you down. (They probably wondered about me, too.)
Anyway, to make a long story, short, the next week, Agim was out of his apartment for the first
time in over 6 years&#8211;and in church. And he had done it on his own.</p>
<p>With faith in the Lord and in himself and in a great desire to be baptized he had got up very early
that next Sunday morning and 1" at a time, 1 step at a time, he had gotten out of his apartment
and down the five flights of stairs on his own. The elders had been by his side and had a taxi
waiting for him. Two weeks of teaching the discussions to him and he was baptized. Brothers
and sisters, Agim has since received the Melchizedek Priesthood and he and Aisha have been
sealed together in the Frankfurt, Germany Temple. I want you to know that a disciple of Christ
must have faith to &#8220;step&#8221; into the unknown.</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that <i>&#8220;Faith is the first principle in revealed religion, and the
foundation of all righteousness.&#8221;</i> He also taught that miracles, signs, gifts of the Spirit, a
knowledge of God, and all good things are all the effects of faith. But he further explained that
faith requires action and that there is no salvation in the general principle of faith alone. Only
when Jesus Christ is the focal point is there faith in salvation (<i>Mormon Doctrine, 
		</i>pp. 261-4).</p>
<p>Our Mission Scripture that all our missionaries memorized in Albanian and then recited at each
Zone Conference along with Doctrine &amp; Covenants 4 was 3<sup>rd</sup> Nephi 5:13</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the son of God. I have been called of him
to declare his word among his people , that they might have everlasting life.</i></p>
<p>This scripture clarifies our role as disciples with a focus on the Savior and a promise of the
salvation of everlasting or eternal life.</p>
<p>My desire today has been to share with you some examples of disciples&#8217; faith which we saw
during our time in Albania that you might have a greater desire to exercise your faith at this
Disciple Preparation Center to become a greater disciple of Christ wherever you might go in life.
May I conclude by telling you of two people who I feel have become true disciples of Christ&#8211;one
an Albanian member and the other a missionary:</p>
<p>Brother Arben Vogli is a young man with a pure heart and a great testimony. He gained his
testimony through his extraordinary study of the Book of Mormon. When he joined the church in
the early 1990's, there were few things translated in the Albanian language, but the Spirit bore
witness to him that what the missionaries were teaching him from the Book of Mormon was true.
He had such a great desire to read the Book of Mormon that he begged the missionaries to give
him a copy, even if it were in English, so that he could study it. Arben spoke no English, but
when he received the book he obtained an Albanian/English Dictionary and set out to read the
book on his own. Imagine starting with the first word &#8220;I&#8221; and looking it up; then the next word
&#8220;Nephi&#8221; and not finding it and then finally figuring it out that it was &#8220;I&#8217;s&#8221; name. And then
looking up &#8220;having&#8221; and not finding it. . . But word by word he proceeded, writing the translated
words in Albanian above English text. </p>
<p>When do you get tired of that and quit? A true disciple doesn&#8217;t and neither did Arben. It took
months to get through 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Nephi, but by then he knew many of the words and it started to
go a little faster. By the mid point of the book, he was able to understand much of what he was
reading and when he finished the book, not only did he have a testimony of it, but he could speak
English&#8211;not necessarily the King&#8217;s English&#8211;in fact, it was a Book of Mormon English, but
nonetheless he could speak and understand English. Arben is a sculptor. I submit that with his
faith and his testimony, he is disciple of Christ whose trip to the temple to be sealed to his family
was like a trip to heaven for him.</p>
<p>Finally, let me tell you about a missionary who, I believe, is a true disciple of Christ. Let me do
so by reading a President&#8217;s Letter he wrote to me one week during his mission. I believe you will
see why I feel his discipleship is real.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Dear President Kinghorn,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Today in Fier, two little beggar boys would not leave us alone. They wanted
money. We told them no. They still wanted money. We told them no again . . . but
they still wanted money. It hurts me to tell them no [because] the more you do it,
the easier it becomes. [It&#8217;s so frustrating.] </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>My answer to these turmoiling [feelings] has always been to [increase] my fast
offerings&#8211;the Lord&#8217;s welfare system. I believe, President, that I will never be a
rich man . . . but I want to (and plan to) give 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">all</span> my excess to the church. If I don&#8217;t
need it, surely the Lord knows someone who does. I want to give and give and
give.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Today I don&#8217;t feel that&#8217;s enough though. True, he who gives money gives much.
But I have more than just money. I have time. I can serve my fellow beings. I can
try to bring light to the eyes of these children. I can share my talents. I can love
the unloved. I can hold the abandoned baby close. I can spread hope through time
spent in service.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Ultimately, I can give my whole self. All I am and want to be, I want to give away
. . . Abundantly giving of [my] all. I will want for nothing. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I made the covenant [to live the Law of Consecration.] I plan to keep it . . . I may
not be able to give the beggar my 20 lek&euml; piece today or tomorrow, but I plan on
giving my <span style="text-decoration: underline">life</span> and my 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">all</span> for the remainder of my days. [I] want to consecrate
[my] performance unto the Lord. [I] want to give my all to this work. [I] may not
give riches in coin or check, but [I can] give the eternal riches of happiness and
peace found in gospel living. President Kinghorn, I love being a missionry. It is a
joy to spread this message.</i></p>
<p>Brothers ands Sisters, his desire to &#8220;give his all&#8221; exhibits true charity or &#8220;loving as Christ would
love.&#8221; He is truly becoming a true disciple of Christ because of his desire to give his all.</p>
<p>I could share a hundred other, equally powerful, experiences about the discipleship of our
missionaries and the faith of our members in Albania, but time won&#8217;t allow it But their ability to
exercise faith and be a disciple of Christ is no different than yours&#8211;or mine</p>
<p>Just like a person who sets out to climb a lofty peak and never knows of the view from the top
unless he summits the mountain, you will never experience the fruits of faith until you exercise
it. Likewise, if you expect to exit this institution as a true disciple of Christ, then you will need to
have experienced His love in your life and you will need to have exercised His power by giving
of yourself. </p>
<p>The Savior taught the Jews, who believed in Him (and the same could apply to us), 
		<i>&#8220;...If ye
continue in my word</i>, (after you leave this Disciple Preparation Center, by applying what you
have learned here) <i>then are ye my disciples indeed: and ye shall know the truth and the truth
shall make you free&#8221; </i>(John 8:31-32).</p>
<p>I testify that life will present you with many opportunities to &#8220;step into the darkness&#8221; and I
promise you the light will follow those who do exercise great faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ. I
testify that faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ, combined with &#8220;disciple preparation&#8221; truly does dispel
fear. I am a personal witness of the power of faith and the miracles that follow and of the
goodness wrought by disciples of Christ. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, 
		amen.</p>

		</p>
<p>You will not fully appreciate the greatness of your teachers here until you face challenges that
require you to put into practice what they have taught you. With time and experience, those
opportunities will come. As you draw upon the lessons they taught, your hearts will swell wide
with gratitude for their dedicated service. It is their sacrifices, and your diligent efforts that have
hallowed these halls of learning.</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">Commencement Upon Life&#8217;s Journey</span></p>
<p>It is a privilege to be here and share with you the joy of your graduation commencement. Some
of you may feel that after several years of hard work, you have finally arrived at the end, but the
word <i>commencement</i> is a key to the meaning of this day. You have achieved an important goal in
your life, but it is not the end. It is a new beginning. It is an opportunity to 
		<i>commence</i> upon the
challenges of a mortal journey, and to do so in the Lord&#8217;s way. For you have kept His
commandment to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of
the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient
for you to understand;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have
been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are
at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations,
and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and
of kingdoms-</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the
calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have
commissioned you</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 88:78-80).</p>
<p>I would like to suggest a few of the most important goals in life that will give you joy as you
fulfill your mission on this earth&#8212;eternal goals that will help you return with honor to your
Father in Heaven. They include:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">(1) Marry in the temple and cultivate eternal family relationships by prayerfully
balancing the many facets of life, such as family, occupation, continuing
education, hobbies, and entertainment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">(2) Faithfully and obediently live your religion and be true to your baptismal and
temple covenants, always treasuring up the good things of life.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">(3) Hold on to the eternal perspective gained here at BYU-Idaho, remembering
that the things of the kingdom are eternal and the things of the world are temporal
or temporary.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">(4) Remember to give dedicated service throughout your life, and always care for
the needy who may require your love and other support.</p>
<p>These are lifetime goals that take focus and time to achieve. Making these goals is not enough,
we must make a plan to carry them out. Only then can we avoid those worldly diversions that so
easily preoccupy and entice us away from path to eternal life.</p>
<p>Tonight or tomorrow, after the excitement of the graduation celebration has subsided, ponder
what you want to achieve in <i>your</i> life and what <i>your </i>goals should be. Take the time to write them
down and review them throughout the coming years. Then, spend a few hours asking yourself
what you can do to accomplish these goals today, tomorrow, next week, and in months ahead.</p>
<p>How do you choose and define these important, eternal goals? And, just as vital, how do you
make a plan to achieve them? Remember: time is the essential&#8212;even critical&#8212;element in your
calculations. From where you stand now, it may seem that you have an indefinite amount of time
to accomplish eternal things.</p>
<p>Everyone has time, it&#8217;s true. Time is the common commodity by which we all measure progress
in our life&#8217;s journey. But just because time passes doesn&#8217;t mean we are making progress. 
		</p>
<p><i>&#8220;This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day
for men to perform their labors&#8221; </i>(Alma 34:32).</p>
<p>I testify that your time on earth will be sufficient to accomplish your preparation and perform the
labors of your life&#8217;s mission&#8212;if you use your time wisely. And there is no better time to do that
than now, in your youth.</p>
<p>In the book of Alma we are taught, <i>&#8220;O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea,
learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God&#8221;</i> (Alma 37:35). We learn &#8220;wisdom in [our]
youth&#8221; so that we will not make mistakes and waste our time wandering in strange paths, getting
lost, and then struggling back to the straight and narrow path that leads to eternal life.</p>
<p>Part of staying on the path is continuing to learn. This learning includes growing mentally and
spiritually in this mortal probation. It means learning from the challenges, opposition, and
tragedies of life and enduring to the end&#8212;for these are the purposes for which we came to live
on this earth.</p>
<p>The scriptures are our curriculum for this continuing education. Consider the textbook we call
Proverbs. In the words of Solomon, one of our educational goals should be <i>&#8220;To know wisdom
and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding&#8221;</i> (Proverbs 1:2). There is a difference
between our intelligence, which is God-given, and our knowledge, which is gained by our own
study and through life&#8217;s experiences. The Book of Proverbs helps us recognize that the real
purpose of mortality is to accomplish this learning&#8212;to gain wisdom and understanding in our
hearts.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding&#8221;</i> (Proverbs 2:2).
Through our actions and obedience, we turn our intellectual knowledge into wisdom. That
wisdom brings understanding to our hearts. And with understanding, we are able to apply our
knowledge in a way that blesses all God&#8217;s children, and helps us return to live with Him again.</p>
<p>As we continue learning, we must be certain we are always coming to a knowledge of the truth
about God and our part in His plan. In the advanced curriculum of life, sometimes the more
knowledge we gain, the easier it is to forget our Heavenly Father and the need for His guiding
hand. The spiritual textbook of Proverbs addresses this most important subject:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil</i> (Proverbs
3:6&#8211;7).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get
understanding</i> (Proverbs 4:7).</p>
<p>How do we gain knowledge in a way that does not cause us to be <i>&#8220;to be lifted up in the pride of
[our] eyes&#8221;</i> (Alma 4:8), and forget that we <i>&#8220;are dependent [on God] for [our] lives and for all
that [we] have and are&#8221;</i>(Mosiah 4:21)?</p>
<p>To answer that question, may I share with you a sacred truth&#8212;a golden key to humility and life-long happiness? If you will take all the knowledge you have been given here at BYU-Idaho, and
all the knowledge you gain throughout your life and apply it to help others, you will have the
wisdom and understanding to discover your mission on this earth. You did not acquire an
education just so that you might earn more money, gain status, and have the physical things of
this life or the titles of men. You acquired it to lift, bless, teach, and help others to come to the
Savior, partake of His Atonement, live his gospel, and inherit eternal life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">Selecting and Achieving the Most Important Goals in Life&#8212;Effective Use of Time and
Resources</span></p>
<p>Now, with that in mind, how do we effectively select and achieve our goals in life? We must be
sensitive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and possess the Spirit of the Lord in our lives. Just
think of the things the Lord asks us to do to obtain and retain the Spirit: prayer, obedience,
scripture study, family home evening, taking the sacrament worthily and regularly, going on a
mission, and going to the temple.</p>
<p>Each of us must make time for pondering and quiet contemplation in our lives. Regular scripture
study, unhurried personal prayer, meditation, and temple attendance can give the Spirit the
opportunity to impress its messages on our hearts. President Hinckley has said,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We live in a very mad world when all is said and done. The pressures are
tremendous. We fly at high speeds. We drive at high speeds. We program
ourselves. . . . There is hardly time to reflect and think and pause and meditate.
[But] we need to</i> (<i>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</i>. Salt Lake City: Deseret
Book, 1997, 334).</p>
<p>Council with the Lord in prayer and with trusted advisors whenever you are going to make an
important decision that will affect your life. More importantly, continue in prayer and, on
occasion, fasting, after council is given. Remember Nephi still needed to be <i>&#8220;led by the Spirit,&#8221;</i>
after he received his assignment, for he did <i>&#8220;not [know] beforehand the things which [he]
should do&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 4:6).</p>
<p>You will not always know beforehand the things you should do. However, you can develop a
pattern&#8212;a habit, if you will&#8212;to fill your life with doing&#8212;which the scriptures refer to as being
&#8220;anxiously engaged.&#8221; And when you are engaged in &#8220;a good cause&#8221;&#8212;the cause of God&#8217;s
Kingdom on the earth&#8212; the Spirit of the Lord will help you know what to do to accomplish your
other goals. <i>&#8220;Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall
be added unto you&#8221;</i> (Matthew 6:33).</p>
<p>When I was about your age, a concept was taught to me by a family friend when I went to
counsel with him about a very important decision I had to make in my life. He taught me about
preparing for the storms of life. The story goes something like this:</p>
<p>A teacher brought a large jar into the classroom and proceeded to fill it with ping pong balls. He
asked the class if the jar was full, and they responded &#8220;yes.&#8221; He then put small pebbles into the
jar and shook it up until it seemed to be &#8220;full&#8221; once more. He asked the class if it was full, and
they said &#8220;yes.&#8221; The teacher then placed fine sand carefully into the jar to fill many of the little
spaces occupied by air. Once more he asked the question, &#8220;Is the jar full?&#8221; With nervous
laughter, the students said &#8220;yes!&#8221; After a few seconds, letting the teaching moment sink in, the
teacher brought out a large glass of water and poured it into the jar until the sand was saturated
and more air was forced from the jar. Now the teacher asked, &#8220;What have you learned?&#8221; It was
crystal clear to the students that the jar was like their lives&#8212;demonstrating to them that there are
so many ways to fill the jar of life. It became clear to the students that if the professor had filled
the jar with pebbles, sand, or water first there would have been no room for the larger and most
important things in life represented by the ping pong balls. At the same time, even while doing
the large and important things, there is plenty of room to accomplish the small and simple
gestures of kindness and service&#8212;to be immersed in acts of love.</p>
<p>One thing is sure: as we go through life&#8212;there are always more things to do each day, week,
month, and year than we have time and energy to accomplish. The secret is to choose wisely
those activities that will help us achieve our divinely inspired goals, and then have the strength
of character and conviction to disregard what would distract or detain us from our eternal
destination.</p>
<p>As you commence on the journey that will be the rest of your life, it is important that you apply
this principle of time&#8212;the principle of the ping pong balls&#8212;each and every day. &#8220;Seek ye first&#8221;
those things that matter most. Only then can you be certain that you will inherit all that our
Heavenly Father has to give us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">Be Able to Have Peace Through the Storms of Life</span></p>
<p>Finally, in this world, know that you are a <i>Latter-day Saint</i> living in the 
		<i>last days</i> before the
second coming, and that Lucifer or Satan is going to rule and reign upon the earth before the
coming of the Lord. As difficult as it may have been to stay pure and worthy in the first two
decades of your life, it is going to be even more challenging for you and your family to defend
yourselves against the buffetings of Satan in the generations to come. My mother told me a story
when I was a young boy that has always reminded me of what I need to do to be ready for the
		<i>storms of life</i> that inevitably come.</p>
<p>The story is about a rancher who was hiring a foreman to assist him with the care of herds and
crops on a large ranch. The rancher had interviewed many for the position, asking each the same
opening question: &#8220;Tell me of your personal background, ranching experience, and your most
valuable quality of character.&#8221; At last, a man came in who answered the third part of that
question a little differently than the others. Looking the rancher straight in the eye, he said, &#8220;My
most valuable quality? I can sleep through a storm!&#8221; The rancher probed to try to find out what
the man meant by his unusual declaration. The response was always the same simple but sincere
one. With deep conviction, he repeated &#8220;I can sleep through a storm.&#8221; Partly out of the rancher&#8217;s
curiosity, the man was hired. Weeks passed, and he was proving himself to be a good foreman.
Then, in the middle of the night, an unexpected, violent thunderstorm hit the ranch with brilliant
streaks of lightning, followed by ear-splitting thunder, shaking the ground and farm buildings
with driving rain and gale force winds. As he lay in bed, the rancher became so concerned for his
livestock, feed lot, and buildings&#8212;everything he owned in this world&#8212;that he got up, put on his
rain slicker, boots, and Stetson cowboy hat, and made his way through the howling storm to the
bunkhouse where the foreman was asleep. The rancher pounded on the door but to no avail. He
could not wake the foreman. Finally, the foreman came sleepily to the door and was confronted
by an angry and agitated rancher, worried for his livestock and property. The rancher said, &#8220;How
can you sleep when the storm may be harming all that we own?&#8221; The foreman responded calmly,
&#8220;When you hired me I told you I could sleep through a storm.&#8221; The rancher responded urgently,
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go inspect the condition of the livestock and feedlot hay, farm equipment, and buildings
NOW!&#8221; As the storm grew in intensity, they rode their horses through the storm and inspected
all elements of the ranch and found everything to be safe, secure, and in order. Everything was
tied down to protect against the violent wind and rain; the animals were safe in shelters; the
equipment was covered; hay stacks were tied down with covers; the barn doors were secure and
shutters closed. All was protected against the onslaught of the unexpected, violent storm. As they
made the inspection together, the rancher was impressed and pleased with the preparation that
the foreman had made to prevent damage, even pending disastrous and irreparable results, from
the storm&#8217;s attack. Then, with a look of gratitude and relief, the rancher quietly turned to the
foreman amidst the howling storm and said with a grin, &#8220;Now I know why you told me you
could sleep through a storm&#8212;well done, partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>If I were a young woman and I were selecting a partner and companion for time and all eternity,
I would ask him, &#8220;Can you sleep through a storm?&#8221; Meaning, have you prepared your life to
withstand the fiery darts of the adversary and the trials of life? If I were a young man looking for
an eternal companion, I would ask the same question. It is not a matter of preparation IF the
storms are going to come in your life. It is preparation for WHEN the storms of adversity will
descend upon you and your loved ones.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why we pray, study the scriptures, go to sacrament meeting, and attend the
temple is because we are diligently and worthily preparing ourselves with spiritual armor to
defend and protect us for the battles of life that lay ahead. It is so vital that we drive our spiritual
tap root deep into the terra firma of life, so that our faith will be unshaken in these tumultuous
last days. It is so vital that we let our Master, the Savior Jesus Christ, be the pilot of our ship so
that we can feel peace despite the winds and waves of these tempestuous times. The question,
&#8220;Will you be able to have peace and sleep through the storms of your life?&#8221; is a question that can
guide all of us as we ponder and pray about our eternal goals and how to accomplish them.</p>
<p>Today is a commencement. It is a commencement of joy and happiness as you embark on a new
life&#8212;as you use the knowledge you have, turn it into wisdom and understanding by your
righteous actions, and use it to bless and serve others. Today is a commencement of making and
keeping goals that will lead you back to your Heavenly Father. It is a day of praise and
thanksgiving to our God. And so with you I raise my voice to speak the Psalmist&#8217;s words: 
		<i>&#8220;This
is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it&#8221;</i> (Psalms 118:24).</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;Observing Possibilities&#8221;</span></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">December 11, 2004</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">President Robert M. Wilkes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A number of years ago, I had a most interesting experience with our youngest son Scott.  He was
a little boy who loved anything having to do with a ball&#8212;particularly a basketball.  He was
playing in the city league for boys his age and having a wonderful time.  His team had a fine
coach who faithfully practiced with them certain nights of the week at Kennedy Elementary
School on the west side of Rexburg.  One night I arrived to pick him up after practice and
walked in on a &#8220;coaching moment.&#8221;  The coach was requesting that the boys watch a
professional basketball game on television over the weekend.  He explained to them the value of
observing the game being played at its highest level.  &#8220;I want you to view the possibilities,&#8221; he
said.  &#8220;Observing the professionals play at their level will make you a better player at your level
because it allows you to glimpse the possibilities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">What a wonderful thing it is when one has occasion to &#8220;glimpse possibilities.&#8221;  As a graduate,
you stand on the threshold of &#8220;possibilities&#8221; beyond BYU-Idaho.  It is not only appropriate for
you to be searching the horizon for &#8220;glimpses&#8221; of what may be out there, but perhaps, more to
the point, critical that you do so.  We live in a world that affords almost endless glimpses of that
which degrades, delimits, and destroys.  If one is not careful, one might conclude that such is the
stuff of which life is made.  But it does not need to be so.  There are those, even many, who live
life at its high levels of possibility.  Some examples might be family or church and community
leaders.  If you are careful and choose them well, you will have friends or professional associates
who will lift your horizons as to the richness life has to offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The scriptures and other historical records give more than ample record of lives well lived.  We
may be inclined to shy away from those accounts, thinking them to be unattainable for the
ordinary man or woman.  Some even feel discouraged by examples of attainment they
themselves are unwilling to pursue.  They have not learned with conviction the wisdom
expressed by John L. Clarke, who served as president of Ricks College for 27 years, when he
declared:  &#8220;This institution is founded on the firm belief that there are extraordinary possibilities
in ordinary people.&#8221;  For the next few minutes, it will be my intent to suggest some
characteristics which seem the common attributes of many who achieve the highest possibilities
available to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The scriptures are instructive in such matters.  From 1 Nephi chapters 10 and 11 we read that,
after admiring the vision his father Lehi had beheld, <i>&#8220;. . . I Nephi, was desirous also that I might
see, and hear, and know of these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">which is the gift of God
unto all those who diligently seek him </span>. . .</i>&#8221; (1 Nephi 10:17, emphasis added).  Already we learn
that <span style="font-weight: bold">desire, diligence, and seeking </span>were important elements of Nephi&#8217;s quest to experience
some of life</span><span style="font-family: 'WP TypographicSymbols', sans-serif">=</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">s better results.  We read further in chapter 11:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>. . . after I had 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">desired</span> to know the things that my father had seen, and 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">believing
</span>that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">pondering</span> in my
heart [read that studying] I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>. . . .  And the spirit said unto me:  . . . what desirest thou? 
		</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And I said:  I desire to behold the things which my father saw.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And the Spirit said unto me:  Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which
he hath spoken?</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And I said:  
		<span style="font-weight: bold">Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father</span></i> (1 Nephi
11:1-5, emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Nephi&#8217;s excellence seems, at least in part, to be rooted in his willingness to desire and to believe
and to learn.  In the second chapter of 1 Nephi it is recorded that he <i>&#8220;. . . [had] great desires to
know . . . wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart
that I did believe <span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> the words . . . spoken by my father . . .&#8221;</i> (1 Nephi 2:16, emphasis added). 
No selective belief system here!  Nephi believed <span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> the words of his father.  A similar system of
desire and belief will also well serve others who have &#8220;glimpsed&#8221; their possibilities and the
possibilities of others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">From historical account we learn of an ordinary woman who, in her way, lived far above
ordinariness and taught us much about how to do it.  Her name is Sally Bush.  Her story was
retold years ago on our campus by Jeffrey R. Holland.  I quote him&#8212;in telling her story&#8212;as
follows:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>To a woman called Sally, a widow with three children, life had been harsh, and
she would indeed welcome a change, an easier way, if it were to come.  She
thought she saw it in a man, a widower from her past, who returned in a nice suit
of clothes with a proposal of marriage and with talk of a prosperous farm,
including some reference to servants.  She saw the prospects for a better life
growing, and she understood him to be a man of substance.  She accepted and
crossed the river with him to view her new possessions.  They were a farm grown
up to wild blackberry vines and sumac and a floorless, windowless hut.  The only
servants were two poorly clad, very thin, barefoot children.  The father had
borrowed the suit and the boots to go courting.  Her first thought was the obvious
one:  &#8220;I cannot stay; I must go back; I have to go home.&#8221;  But then she looked at
the children, especially the younger one&#8212;a boy&#8212;and while her 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">spirit subdued
the passions of her flesh</span>, she rolled up her sleeves and with her eyes on this
young man, spoke the immortal words which ought to be engraved on every
teacher&#8217;s heart:  <span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay for the sake of this boy.&#8221;</span></i></span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>&#8220;Oh, Sally Bush, what a treasure trembled in the balance that day,&#8221; wrote one
whose mother was a neighbor of the boy.  And Sally Bush Lincoln did not know
when she looked at that melancholy face of the ten-year-old that her stepson
would someday be the President of these United States, saving it through a tragic
and Civil War, a war which would ultimately claim his own life among the
numbered dead.  Sally Bush Lincoln, discouraged, tired, poor, looked into the
face of a ten-year-old and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll stay for the sake of this boy.&#8221;</i>  (Jeffrey R.

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;For the sake of this boy.&#8221;  Indeed, Sally Bush had employed one of the great characteristics of
		<span style="font-weight: bold">extraordinariness</span>.  
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">She had acted upon a cause greater than her own self-interest</span> and she had
the strength of character to &#8220;subdue the passions of her flesh&#8221; in order to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">If you do not currently possess a cause or a reason greater than your own self-interest, rush to
find one.  Without such a cause (or many of them) life will tend to be shallow and largely
unfulfilling.  In any case, it is for each of us, first to find and then to embrace the greatest cause
of all:  even the cause of Jesus Christ, the Master of all good possibilities.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Much loved graduates, if you would travel life</span><span style="font-family: 'WP TypographicSymbols', sans-serif">=</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">s high road, as you leave this place and these
people, you must travel with <span style="font-weight: bold">desire </span>and<span style="font-weight: bold">
</span>with <span style="font-weight: bold">diligence</span>.  You must 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">ponder</span> great lives, great
events, great teachings; and you must <span style="font-weight: bold">be believing.</span>  You will be well served to 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">have a cause
greater than self </span>and the strength of spirit to 
		<span style="font-weight: bold">subdue the passions of your flesh.  
		</span>To do so will
add richness and dimension to your possibilities and help make of your life the gift that it is
possible for you to create&#8212;a gift that you will ultimately be pleased to present to the Lord.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">And so we end as we began, with a coaching moment.  &#8220;I want you boys [you young men and
young women] to watch a professional basketball game on television over the weekend.  It will
help you understand your possibilities.  Observing professionals play at their level will make you
a better player at your level because it allows you to glimpse the possibilities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">May it be so for each of us, is my prayer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In conclusion, I must make reference to Elder and Sister David A. Bednar who only days ago
were serving as president and first lady of Brigham Young University-Idaho.  They had done so
with distinction, creativity, and faithfulness for 7&#189; years.  Until just shortly before their
departure, they had expected to be here with you today.  I have attended many graduation
ceremonies and other functions with the Bednars and have heard them express their love for each
of you.  If they were here today, I believe they would express those feelings much as they did
last April:</span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Sister Bednar and I love you.  We have so much enjoyed visiting with you on
campus and in your apartments, participating with you in home evenings, talking
about your challenges and opportunities, answering your questions, and
becoming better acquainted.  We will miss you.  And we would love to hear from
you; please be sure to let us know about the things that are happening in your
lives.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">So do Sister Wilkes and I love you and wish you well as you move forward with your life&#8217;s
journey.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>
