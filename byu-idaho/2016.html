<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Sister Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;President Gilbert and I are so excited to welcome you back to BYU-Idaho. We hope each of you had a wonderful Christmas and that your transition this semester is going well.</p>
<p><br /><strong>President Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;We are especially pleased to be speaking together today. And while we don't expect to follow this format for each devotional, this message particularly lends itself to speaking together. We'd like to start today's message by sharing a short video about our family.<sup>1</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup><strong>Sister Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;The title of our talk is "Happiness in Family Life," and we will draw heavily on "The Family: A Proclamation to the World." We recognize that many students come from difficult family circumstances. So even though we feel deeply about righteous family aspirations, we are neither na&iuml;ve nor insensitive to the realities faced in many families. As just one example, for the greater part of a decade, President Gilbert and I worked with youth in the Boston area, some of whom came from difficult family environments. During that experience we saw the heartbreak that tears apart families when individuals make poor choices and violate covenants&mdash;decisions that impact generations both emotionally and spiritually. But we also saw many of those young men and young women rise above these challenges. Here is a picture of some of those youth who subsequently attended BYU-Idaho, married in the temple, and have gone on to start families of their own.<br /><br /><strong>President Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;Thus, while we recognize the realities that many face, these circumstances only reinforce the conviction of our message. As we speak, we will draw on personal, even sacred experiences in our own family. We have elected to do this with some trepidation: we do not wish to imply that our family has everything figured out, because we don't. But for us to share our message today, we needed to draw on personal experience. We hope you will accept our efforts in the spirit with which they are intended.<br /><br /><strong></strong><strong>A Proclamation to the World</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;As we prepared for this devotional, it was clear that the Lord was inspiring us in deliberate ways. Since our call to BYU-Idaho, emphasizing the family has been a priority in our ministry with students. Part of this effort comes as President Gilbert and I participate in the Eternal Family course at BYU-Idaho. In this course, students explore each paragraph in the proclamation on the family.<br /><br />For example, paragraph one presents the proclamation on the family; paragraph two introduces the topic of gender and eternal identity; paragraph three discusses covenants and ordinances tied to marriage; paragraph four covers chastity; paragraph five reminds us of the sanctity of life; paragraph six outlines marital roles; paragraph seven introduces the concept of "happiness in family life;" paragraph eight presents a prophetic warning to those who ignore family responsibilities; and paragraph nine provides a call to responsible citizens everywhere to strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society.<sup>2</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup><strong>President Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;Why such a deliberate statement on the family? Part of the answer must certainly come from the prophetic warning in paragraph eight where we are cautioned "that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets."<sup>3</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>We live in a society of increasingly "fragile families" where childbearing is becoming decoupled from marriage and divorce rates have skyrocketed.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Indeed, there is a growing body of social science research that shows the dramatic costs of declining family structure.<br /><br />For example, children from homes without intact family structures are more likely to suffer economically, psychologically, and socially. This is often manifest in increased physical abuse, substance abuse, and other behavioral risk factors. Moreover, growing up outside of an intact marriage increases the likelihood that children themselves divorce and become unwed parents. Fatherlessness increases the risk of a child's failure in school and decreases the probability that the child will attend college. Tragically, fatherlessness disproportionately affects poorer families and increases the probability of repeated cycles of poverty.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;As Robert Putnam summarized: "All these changes in family structure have produced a massive, class-biased decline in the number of children raised in two-parent families."<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Obviously, there are many resilient children who overcome these challenges&mdash;our youth from Boston are great examples of this. Yet, while some secular organizations try to ignore the social cost of declining family structure, the empirical evidence continues to mount. I recall a conversation I had with the editorial team at&nbsp;<em>The Atlantic</em>&nbsp;in Washington, D.C., when I worked for the Deseret News. Though some wanted to dismiss our focus on the family as simply a religious nicety, I responded: "Look, you are committed to addressing poverty. Well, if you are serious about poverty, then you better also be serious about fatherlessness because the two are intricately connected." Those conversations eventually led to a five-part series jointly produced by&nbsp;<em>The Atlantic</em>&nbsp;and the<em>&nbsp;Deseret News</em>&nbsp;focused on fatherlessness in American society.<br /><br />That series opened important discussions about the family in American media, but it is also increasingly clear that marriage and the family are more than a social phenomena. As Elder D. Todd Christofferson has stated: "The social science case for marriage and for families headed by a married man and woman is compelling. ... But our claims for the role of marriage and family rest not on social science but on the truth that they are God's creation."<sup>7</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup><strong></strong><strong>Happiness in Family Life</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;Paragraph one of the proclamation reads: "[We] solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children."<sup>8</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>What is so powerful about the nature of a family that makes it&nbsp;<em>central</em>&nbsp;to the Creator's plan? Part of that answer relates to our ability to sacrifice and serve others.<br /><br />One of our dear friends served as a missionary years ago in the France Bordeaux Mission under Elder Neil L. Andersen. In our friend's first interview with his mission president, the young missionary spoke thoroughly about his investigators, the number of lessons taught, and the general progress in his area. After a rather one-sided interview, the mission president eventually asked: "How is your companion?" After a pause, the mission president continued: "I've been visiting with him all morning about whether he would stay on his mission." Despite all of his focus on missionary work, our friend had completely missed the struggles of his companion. Elder Andersen was teaching this young missionary a truth that is true in missions and in marriages: never forget the spiritual progress of your companion.</p>
<p>In fact, happiness in marriage comes when we are attuned to the needs of our companion and serve our spouse in Christ-like ways. Paragraph seven of the proclamation states: "Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland applied the concept of Christ-like love to marriage using Moroni's verses on charity.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And charity suffereth long." In a marriage, we do not always find immediate rewards or solutions to challenges. Loving spouses suffer long for each other and for their family.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"[A]nd is kind." There is no one you should treat with more care and kindness than your spouse.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"[A]nd envieth not." There is no room for jealousy in a marriage.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"[Charity] is not puffed up." Any sense of self-importance in a marriage is destructive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"[Charity] seeketh not her own." When we love a spouse, we seek his or her interests and needs first, before our own.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"[Charity] is not easily provoked." We see so many instances in marriages where spouses are looking to be offended when no slight was ever intended.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"[Charity] thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth." Elder Holland references Shakespeare's Othello who listened to the whisperings of Iago when he should have been seeing the purity and sincerity of his true love in Desdemona.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finally, "[Charity] beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Again, let us re-emphasize that "Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup></p>
<p><strong>Divine Complementarity and the Role of Mothers</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>President Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;Now, love in marriage comes with different complementarities and different gifts from each spouse. President Henry B. Eyring described this divine complementarity at a conference in the Vatican on marriage and the family. Let's listen to his description of how marriage changed who he was.<sup>13</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>We hope you noticed how President and Sister Eyring became something more together in their marriage. If we think carefully about this divine complementarity, I think we begin to understand part of the answer to our earlier question as to why "the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of his children."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;As Elder David A. Bednar has taught, "The natures of male and female spirits complete and perfect each other, and therefore men and women are intended to progress together toward exaltation."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;I love being married to Christine Gilbert. I am a different person today because of our marriage more than 20 years ago. Marriage changes us into who the Lord wants us to become.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Sister Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;Note that these complementarities come with distinctive spiritual responsibilities between husband and wife. In paragraph seven of the proclamation, we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Let us first speak to the role of mothers. As Sister Julie B. Beck has stated: "The responsibility mothers have today has never required more vigilance. More than at any time in the history of the world, we need mothers who know."<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup><br /></sup><strong>President Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;I watched this play out as a first-year professor at the Harvard Business School. A controversial article had surfaced about the role of women in the workplace. My teaching group leader said to me: "Clark, do not address this topic if it surfaces. You are a first-year professor and a Mormon. It will blow up no matter what you say." Following his counsel, I had managed to generally avoid the subject until a young student from France, who I will call Claire, came to my office and asked: "Professor Gilbert, my husband and I are considering having a baby. What is your advice?" Given my earlier counsel, I responded that the decision was a personal choice between the student and her husband. But she quickly retorted: "No! That's not good enough. You are my only professor who talks about values. I want to know what you have to say." I responded carefully: "Claire, you are so talented and have wonderful opportunities ahead of you. But for both of us, no one will care in 25 years whether we went to the Harvard Business School, but rather whether we made a difference in the lives of our families." She immediately responded, "I knew it!" Claire and her husband had a baby the next fall. I've reflected on that exchange many times. What became clear was that everywhere Claire looked&mdash;her peers, her work, and the world around her&mdash;the role of motherhood was devalued. In some ways I believe the reason she reached out to me was because I could validate an answer she already knew in her heart.<br /><br />Elder Quentin L. Cook described some of the challenges sisters face regarding motherhood:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">These are very emotional, personal decisions, but there are two principles that we should always keep in mind. First, no woman should ever feel the need to apologize or feel that her contribution is less significant because she is devoting her primary efforts to raising and nurturing children. Nothing could be more significant in our Father in Heaven's plan. Second, we should all be careful not to be judgmental or assume that sisters are less valiant if the decision is made to work outside the home. We rarely understand or fully appreciate people's circumstances. Husbands and wives should prayerfully counsel together, understanding they are accountable to God for their decisions.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>We have already addressed Elder Cook's first principle about the dedicated role of mothers. The second principle is more nuanced, particularly in a university environment. Occasionally, Sister Gilbert and I receive a question asking about a particular major and whether it will benefit a student in her role as a mother. First, we commend all of our female students. One of the best predictors of a child receiving a college education is the education of his or her mother.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Additionally, we hope all of our female students will recognize that they are likely to have significant periods of time in their single&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>married lives where they will provide financially. In all of this, we invite you to pray and ask God for direction in your decision. And to our friend who asked us whether she should major in engineering, we say "carry on" if that is where you find passion academically. But at the same time, never let your future career (or anything else) deceive you about your divine role as a mother. Use your education to develop yourself as a leader in your home, the Church, and your community.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Sister Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;President Russell M. Nelson recently shared this quote from President Boyd K. Packer:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We need women who are organized and women who can organize. We need women with executive ability who can plan and direct and administer; women who can teach, women who can speak out.&nbsp;...&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We need women with the gift of discernment who can view the trends in the world and detect those that, however popular, are shallow or dangerous.<sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>Divine Complementarity and the Role of Fathers</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The proclamation also reminds both women and men about their responsibility to support each other: &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />"In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;While I have the primary role for nurturing our children in our home, I want you to know that President Gilbert also loves and nurtures our children. I am grateful for a husband who teaches in our home and who helps with everything from homework to changing diapers. Here is a picture of President Gilbert reading to three of our girls as he arrived home from work.</p>
<p>He hadn't even changed out of his suit, but he could tell the children needed some fatherly attention right then. As we turn our attention to the role of fathers, let us caution that while society's attacks on mothers are significant, the attacks on fathers are no less real. The world frequently paints men as dumb, lazy, and unneeded. In fact, media studies show a pattern where fathers are portrayed on television as unengaged and ineffectual.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>We'd like to share with you a story of a young man who has truly risen above life's challenges to become a righteous father and husband. This is a picture of Jonathan and his oldest son.</p>
<p>As a high school student, Jonathan did not have a strong academic background and school did not come easily. Moreover, he was not taught patterns of priesthood leadership in his home. Yet, Jonathan made a series of early decisions that have changed his life and that of his future family's. Jonathan came to BYU-Idaho. He served a mission in Brazil before returning to graduate from BYU-Idaho and marry in the temple. He subsequently graduated from a prominent master's program in digital media and is now a director at a major technology company. More importantly, Jonathan is now the father of two young boys and is learning firsthand how to become a righteous father in Zion. It turns out that dads matter a great deal.<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;So, to all of our future fathers: know your family is counting on you.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Patterns of Righteousness Parenting</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>President Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;We conclude with several family patterns that have blessed our home&mdash;patterns of teaching, ministering, and finding joy. One of the more sacred roles each of you will have as a parent is that of a teacher. Ironically, most teaching opportunities will be in less formal settings. One of the best times for us to teach is at the dinner table. Another powerful setting is what we call "transition moments" when a child first re-enters the home. These opportunities happen right after school or at the end of a night out. Another teaching setting for parents is in nightly scripture reading. One of the great joys of my life can be captured in this image:<br /><br />&nbsp;The Gilbert nightly scripture reading draws on a pattern we learned from dear friends. Our children gather but read on their own wherever they are in their individual scripture study. Then after a period of quiet reading as a family, each individual shares an insight. From my journal:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I love family scripture reading: so powerful to see each of our children study and then share from the scriptures. It's like the BYU-Idaho Learning Model in action in our home! They have a remarkable and expanding capacity. I saw that again this evening as I watched John study so intently and Paige share her thoughts so earnestly. We have great children with strong patterns developing in each of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;Another pattern we have tried to develop in our home is the effort to minister to the one. There are eight Gilbert children and each has different needs, which means we need to find ways to minister to each of them individually.</p>
<p>One of the things I love about my husband is that he never walks in the door with his cell phone on. When President Gilbert comes home, he is ready to focus on our family and he approaches each child individually. Another pattern I have tried to follow is to keep a parenting journal about each of our children. We have tried to find other ways of ministering to our children individually. These include father's interviews, daddy-daughter dates, and investing in key interests of each child.</p>
<p><strong>President Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;The last pattern we would share with you is finding joy. You don't have to be perfect as a parent. You simply have to do your best and ask the Lord to make up the difference. Sister Gilbert and I make mistakes as parents, but through it all we try to find joy in the process. It is also important that your children know you love being their parent. When I'm driving with one of our children, I love to say, "Do you know how awesome it is to be your dad?" I then share one or two things I love about being their father. As a parent, make sure to find joy in the process and share that joy with your family.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;In closing, we add our witness that the family is indeed "central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children."<sup>24</sup>Happiness in family life is found when we live and apply the teachings of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>President Gilbert:</strong>&nbsp;There is a divine complementarity between husband and wife in marriage and in raising a family. Finally, there are patterns in a family that help us teach, minister, and find joy. May we remain firm in our commitment to the family, we so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>My purpose in addressing you today is to reflect on the gift of friendship in a gospel context. &nbsp;My hope and my prayer is that these reflections will help you and me to become more Christlike friends.<br /><br />If you remember nothing else from our discussion today, I hope you will consider that one of the most important opportunities presented to you at this formative moment in your life is the opportunity to make lifelong friends who will influence how you think and act.&nbsp; Chosen and fostered carefully, such friendships will, in the words of the booklet&nbsp;<em>The Strength of Youth</em>, &nbsp;"help you be a better person and will make it easier for you to live the gospel of Jesus Christ."<sup>1</sup><ins cite="mailto:Paul Edwards" datetime="2016-01-19T02:29"></ins><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>When President Gilbert asked me to speak to you in this devotional setting it was on the heels of some deeply meaningful interactions with old friends. Those experiences led me to ponder on my own stewardship of the friendships in my life, which in turn led me to a more focused study of friendship itself.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me begin by briefly comparing friendship with family.<br /><br />Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly those endowed in its temples, have been well tutored in the importance of the marital and parental relationships associated with the eternal family.<br /><br />As members of the Brigham Young University-Idaho community, you were particularly blessed with powerful teaching on the doctrine of the family in this setting just last week by President and Sister Gilbert, whose very lives exemplify what they taught.<br /><br />Stable, consecrated families are central to God's plan of happiness. They are eternal in nature, but their blessings are felt profoundly during our mortal sojourn. They have proven to be the most effective institution for stabilizing society thru their nurturance of children and their moral refinement of committed parents. Because of their permanency and importance, family relationships have been rightly stressed in our theology and teaching.<br /><br />But consider how little agency is involved in the formation of family relationships. In modern Western society, you have full agency to decide with whom you will share sacred marital vows. (Thank goodness!) But you didn't have a say in who brought you into this world. You didn't have a say in who is designated as your brother or sister. And you clearly didn't have any say in who married your aunt, or the little urchins they brought into the world. And yet, assuming there has been no abuse present, to each of these unchosen relations you owe a familial obligation.<br /><br />And, isn't it fascinating to consider that it is only adoptive parents who are allowed some modest choice in who become their children.<br /><br />By contrast, we have been given full agency to choose our friends. Friendship is an act of mutual choice persisting only as long as it is beneficial to both parties. Perhaps because it is so closely related to taste and choice and born of serendipity, friendship has received far less attention than family in formal religious teaching and guidance.<br /><br />And yet near the end of his life, Joseph Smith taught that: "Friendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of 'Mormonism.'"<sup>2</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>This evocative nugget of teaching came just months after Joseph had received the revelation recorded in&nbsp;<em>Doctrine &amp; Covenants</em>&nbsp;130 about the eternal nature of our social relations: "And that same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there, only it will be coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do not now enjoy."<sup>3</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Indeed, our baptismal covenant enjoins us to connect ourselves to the well-being of those who mourn or stand in need of comfort.<sup><strong>4</strong></sup><sup><strong><br /></strong></sup><sup><strong><br /></strong></sup>We all know that we have covenantal obligations to family. But I think it is clear from scriptural precept and narrative that we have important sacred obligations of care that extend beyond our family.<br /><br />Nonetheless, let me be clear that what I share today about friendship is not what I would consider doctrine. Your salvation does not hang on my insights. Indeed, my insights may be worth precisely what you have paid for them. But I do think that they have been culled from inspired accumulated wisdom intended to help you enjoy greater happiness in this life.<br /><br />Now I am also the first to admit it is very likely you, and not I, that should be teaching about friendship.<br /><br />According to a recent survey, 18-24 year olds average 649 friends on Facebook.<sup>5</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>On average, you have about 200 more friends on Facebook than I do. Based on your "friending" behaviors on Facebook, you are demonstrably nearly 50 percent "friendlier" than I am.<br /><br />But, as much as we may love how social media allows us to quickly peruse pictures of the four cheese omelet made by the our cousin's fianc&eacute;e, , or experience the tropical vacation sunset of a chum from high school, other social indicators suggest that we have fewer intimate friends than did the adults of yesteryear.<br /><br />In his book&nbsp;<em>The Road to Character</em>, David Brooks notes that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Decades ago, people typically told pollsters that they had four or five close friends, people to whom they could tell everything. Now the common answer is two or three, and the number of people with no confidants has doubled. Thirty-five percent of older adults report being chronically lonely, up from 20 percent a decade ago.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>And, according to Sara Konrath at the University of Michigan, the self-reported empathy of college students has declined since 1980, with an especially steep drop in the past 10 years. &nbsp;"Almost 75 percent of students today rate themselves as less empathic than the average student 30 years ago."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>So even though you have far more friends on Facebook, will you allow me to share some of what I have learned recently about friendship and some of what I have learned over my lifetime? And then let's talk about what it all means as we resolve to be more Christlike friends.</p>
<p>As the prior studies have demonstrated, I have learned that in our age of near limitless virtual connectivity, far too many people are very much alone, a condition the Lord has identified from the very beginning as "not good."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Of course, the scriptural allusion I have made is to our need for marital love and family. But I believe it applies to other forms of human love and companionship. The Lord did not intend for us to "go it alone." And his prophets have emphasized this:</p>
<p>Said Brigham Young "I have heard Elders say they were not dependant upon any man,... I consider that we are all dependent one upon another for our exhaltation and that our interest is inseparably connected."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The ancient Greeks had much more nuanced language for relationships than do we.&nbsp; And I think those ancient distinctions can be useful for us moderns who overuse the words of romantic love. (You know what I mean: should we really use the verb "adore" for that expensive piece of clothing that we, in all truth, covet? Must an apparent friendship bond between males be mischaracterized as a "bromance"?)<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>There are at least four "loves" that the ancient Greeks carefully distinguished in their speech and writing.</p>
<p><em>Eros</em>&nbsp;captured for the Greeks not only sensual desire but that very passionate, very personal longing for a particular person&mdash;what we moderns refer to as romantic love.</p>
<p><em>Agape</em>&nbsp;is the Greek word for abiding non-sexual love that the early Christian writers used to capture the love of God. It is unconditional, unchanging, and perhaps best approximated by the word charity. Forms of the word&nbsp;<em>agape</em>&nbsp;are used, for instance, in the Gospel of John and the Epistles of John to talk about the love of God.</p>
<p>But the Greeks made helpful distinctions about the depth of the love exhibited in other relationships.</p>
<p><em>Storge</em>&nbsp;is how they talked about natural affection or empathy&mdash;that intuitive, comfortable and familiar kindness that one doesn't have to do a lot to cultivate. It is how well adjusted people feel toward cousins and companions. It is the kind of affection I have toward the first grade class of children I read to at a local elementary school. I wish I knew them individually&mdash;but in honesty I don't&mdash;and &nbsp;yet I am not lying when I say "I love those kids." This is my understanding of the Greek concept of&nbsp;<em>storge</em>.</p>
<p>And then there is&nbsp;<em>philia</em>, sometimes referred to as "brotherly love," (e.g.,&nbsp;<em>philia</em>&nbsp;forms the root of the name Philadelphia, which has long been known as the City of Brotherly Love). This is the kind of love I want us to consider in depth today as I talk about friendship. As one writer put it, this is "the deep comradely friendship that developed between brothers in arms who had fought side by side on the battlefield. It was about showing loyalty to your friends, sacrificing for them, as well as sharing your emotions with them."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This is the kind of deep friendship we see in the scriptures between David and Jonathan, united in their fight against the Philistines. The First Book Samuel beautifully describes them as having their souls knit together.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>And&nbsp;<em>philia</em>&nbsp;is not just for "brothers in arms." You might know it as the deep friendship between Hermione Granger, Harry Potter, and Ron Weasley, one of the greatest of all fictional friendship trios.&nbsp; They were brought together from vastly different backgrounds as classmates, but their friendship and loyalty was forged (as I was reminded by my daughter Miriam) in their battle against the Mountain Troll.&nbsp; J.K. Rowling makes that clear; "[F]rom that moment on, Hermione Granger became [Harry and Ron's] friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them."&nbsp;<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The great 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century Christian apologist, C.S. Lewis, wrote a masterful monograph in 1960 about the distinctions between&nbsp;<em>storge, philia, eros</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>agape</em>. It is titled, quite simply,&nbsp;<em>The Four Loves</em>, and is has formed the backbone of my recent study of friendship. I commend it without reservation. Among the many insights to take from Lewis' study is that these categories of love are not hermetically sealed. They bleed and blend into one another. A great marriage relationship, for example, should benefit from the best of romance, friendship and charity.</p>
<p>About the relationship between&nbsp;<em>storge</em>&nbsp;(empathy) and&nbsp;<em>philia</em>&nbsp;(friendship) Lewis wrote, "Friendship arises out of mere Companionship when two or more of the companions discover that they have in common some insight or interest or even taste which the others do not share and which, till that moment, each believed to be his own unique treasure (or burden). The typical expression of opening Friendship would be something like, 'What? You too? I thought I was the only one.'"<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This is very much how my friendship with President Gilbert developed. We met in a purely professional setting because we were both administrators in higher education. It didn't take long for us to recognize within one another a shared passion for student achievement, a shared recognition about how poorly contemporary higher education was organized to accelerate that kind of accomplishment, and a shared sense of mission that it was important to dramatically improve that system. "What? You too? I thought I was the only one."</p>
<p>Lewis states: "To the Ancients, Friendship seemed the happiest and most fully human of all loves; the crown of life and the school of virtue. The modern world, in comparison, ignores it."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I love that description of friendship as a school of virtue.</p>
<p>David Brooks puts friendship at the heart of his discussion of character development:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[C]haracter is built not only through austerity and hardship. It is also built sweetly through love and pleasure. When you have deep friendships with good people, you copy and then absorb some of their best traits. When you love a person deeply, you want to serve them and earn their regard.&nbsp; ... Moreover, the struggle against the weaknesses in yourself is never a solitary struggle. No person can achieve self-mastery on his or her own. Individual will, reason, compassion, and character are not strong enough to consistently defeat selfishness, pride, greed, and self-deception. Everybody needs redemptive assistance from outside&mdash;from family, friends, ancestors, rules, traditions, institutions, exemplars, and, for believers, God. We all need people to tell us when we are wrong, to advise us on how to do right, and to encourage support, arouse, cooperate, and inspire us along the way.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>So I would ask you&mdash;are you using the friendships that God has afforded you as an instrument for redemptive assistance? When through the blessed opportunities for companionship afforded by school, work, missions and church callings you have identified that unique spark of shared interest that has you pull away from the crowd into a duo, or trio, or quartet of friends, is it a school of virtue or a school for scandal? Is your conversation edifying? Or does it devolve into criticism, gossip and conspiracy?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I completely appreciate that part of the joy of friendship is that it affords a place where you can, on occasion, goof off, vent a frustration, or discuss a doubt. But if it is only that, then I believe you have probably found a clique rather than a fellowship.</p>
<p>One of the most challenging times in my graduate studies was writing my dissertation. Having successfully completed all my coursework, I was told that I was now qualified to pursue independently my original research. To some, such freedom was exhilarating. To an extrovert like myself, it was debilitating. It was a good friend who made all the difference in my ability to persist in the research, analysis, writing<ins cite="mailto:Paul Edwards" datetime="2016-01-18T16:04">&nbsp;</ins>and rewriting that allowed me to complete my dissertation.</p>
<p>At one point, I would regularly share a great deal of my research with a longtime colleague who was also finishing his graduate work. &nbsp;The two of us had been through so much together.&nbsp; He knew the substance of my research and he also knew many of the faculty members on my dissertation committee. He seemed a natural ally in my cause. But I actually found that at that particular time and season of my life, that I needed to limit my interactions with him. Why? Because rather than edifying one another to do good work, our conversation almost always devolved into self-pity and critique. We were brilliantly skilled at identifying and cursing the outside forces that seemed to be conspiring against us but pretty inept at taking concrete steps toward success.</p>
<p>What made all the difference for me was when I made a new friend, John. Although we didn't know the substance of one another's arcane research, we shared a common sense of humor, a common outlook on life and a common aspiration for excellence and accomplishment. We would meet a few times each week, usually over cheap ethnic food, or a cup of hot chocolate. We would to listen to each other, commiserate with one another, but mostly we would celebrate our small successes and then challenge one another to keep at the mundane tasks of scholarship&mdash;the way jogging buddies egg one another on to pick up the pace. &nbsp;With a ready smile and an easy laugh, John's friendship helped me bear the burden of seeing my dissertation to completion.</p>
<p>I feel compelled to have you think about how you invest in your friendships because your college years provide an unparalleled moment within your life for rich and varied companionship that should grow into abundant lifelong friendships.</p>
<p>Ten years from now you will likely be on a geographically and professionally constrained path of family, work and church service. &nbsp;That is as it should be. But in the first half of this decade of your life, your associations are in constant flux. You are in new classes with new classmates each semester; you are serving missions around the world, transferred to new companions and locations every few months; you are pursuing internships around the country; and you are likely changing apartments and rotating roommates each year. You are afforded an array of companionships from which, I trust, will emerge deep and abiding friendships.</p>
<p>So, I implore you to follow this plainspoken counsel given by the First Presidency in the "Strength of Youth" about friends:</p>
<p>Everyone needs good and true friends. They will be a great strength and blessing to you. They will influence how you think and act, and even help determine the person you will become. They will help you be a better person and will make it easier for you to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. Choose friends who share your values so you can strengthen and encourage each other in living high standards.</p>
<p>To have good friends, be a good friend. Show genuine interest in others; smile and let them know you care about them. Treat everyone with kindness and respect, and refrain from judging and criticizing those around you. Do not participate in any form of bullying. Make a special effort to be a friend to those who are shy or lonely, have special needs, or do not feel included.</p>
<p>As you seek to be a friend to others, do not compromise your standards. If your friends urge you to do things that are wrong, be the one to stand for the right, even if you stand alone. You may need to find other friends who will support you in keeping the commandments. Seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost as you make these choices.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I testify that as you do so, that a small cadre of true face-to-face friends (as contrasted with scores of social media friends) will be a lifelong resource.</p>
<p>When I have turned to the Lord in my adult life for help with the death of a loved one, a troubling doubt, a wandering child, a professional setback, or a bout of the blues, He has invariably answered my prayers through the instrument of a dear old friend.</p>
<p>You'll remember I began by noting that the Gospel offers relatively little formal guidance on friendship. So I was struck by this sentence that I stumbled upon, written by the longtime pastor for Harvard College, Andrew P. Peabody, in his introduction to a translation of Cicero's disquisition on friendship:</p>
<p>"But in the life of the Founder of Christianity, who teaches, most of all, by example, friendship has its apogee&mdash;its supreme pre-eminence and honor. He treats his apostles, and speaks of and to them, not as mere disciples, but as intimate and dearly beloved friends;"<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>How interesting then, that in the scriptures of the Restored Gospel, the Lord takes special effort to address his apostles as friends:</p>
<p>"And again I say unto you, my friends, for from henceforth I shall call you friends, it is expedient that I give unto you this commandment, that ye become even as my friends in days when I was with them, traveling to preach the gospel in my power;"<sup>19</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>It is as if, the Lord found in Joseph Smith and his courageous associates, those special companions who shared the Savior's same passion (and burden) to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. "What? You too? I thought I was the only one."</p>
<p>Thank you for the spirit of preparation and inquiry you have brought with you today.&nbsp; I believe that as you ponder and apply what we have discussed today it will help you (in the words of President Henry B. Eyring) to become "legendary for [your] capacity to build the people around [you] and add value wherever [you] serve.<sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I am grateful that as we close our time together today we will be able to join our voices together in praise of "Each Life That Touches Ours for Good."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;As we sing Carol Lynn Davidson's hymn, I will ponder not only on the wonderful friends who have strengthened my faith and enriched my days, but also what the Spirit teaches me about how I might be a more Christlike friend. I hope and pray that you will too. In the name of our Savior, Redeemer and Friend, even Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
<p>David A. Bednar was ordained and set apart as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on October 7, 2004.&nbsp; Prior to his call to the Quorum of the Twelve, Elder Bednar served as an Area Authority Seventy, as an Area Authority, as a Regional Representative, twice as a stake president, and as a bishop.</p>
<p>Elder Bednar was born on June 15, 1952, in Oakland, California.&nbsp; He served as a full-time missionary in Southern Germany and then attended Brigham Young University, where he received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree.&nbsp; He also received a doctoral degree in organizational behavior from Purdue University.</p>
<p>After completing his education, Elder Bednar was a professor of business management at Texas Tech University and at the University of Arkansas.&nbsp; He then served as the president of Brigham Young University-Idaho from 1997-2004.</p>
<p>Elder Bednar married Susan Kae Robinson in the Salt Lake Temple on March 20, 1975, and they are the parents of three sons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Words are completely inadequate to describe the feelings Susan and I have each time we return to this campus. We cherish the memories of the people with whom we served, the special and set apart nature of this place, and the extraordinary experiences we shared. Some of the most meaningful events of our lives occurred here, and we are grateful to be with you today.</p>
<p>The title of my message is quite unusual, "Repeat Over Again . . . the Same Things as Before." This abbreviated phrase is found in the forty-sixth verse in the Joseph Smith History and describes an characteristic of the instruction Joseph received from the angel Moroni. I have chosen this title because my purpose is to explain the spiritual value and importance of repetitious learning and teaching.</p>
<p>Precisely because repetition is a pattern related to receiving and recognizing revelation, I pray earnestly for the Holy Ghost to help us understand one another and rejoice together.</p>
<p><strong>Moroni's Appearances to Joseph Smith</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>To prepare for this devotional, you were invited to read selected verses in the Joseph Smith History in the Pearl of Great Price. Let me quickly review several key incidents from the four appearances of Moroni and his communications with Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>On the evening of September 21, 1823, young Joseph Smith prayed and asked forgiveness for his sins and follies so that he might know his standing before&nbsp;God. While in the act of praying, a light filled his room and the angel Moroni appeared at his bedside standing in the air. The heavenly messenger called Joseph by name and said that God had a work for him to do, and that his name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues. Moroni told Joseph about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and reviewed numerous Old and New Testament prophecies that would be fulfilled in God's latter-day work.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with the fact that Moroni returned two more times that same night and once the next morning and repeated his message to Joseph Smith. This example of repetitious teaching was intended to emphasize the deep significance of the things that had been communicated.</p>
<p>It is quite common for many of us in describing this series of events to state that Moroni delivered the same message to Joseph a total of four times. Such a statement is accurate but incomplete. As we now consider the three subsequent visitations by Moroni, we will see that indeed the same message was presented on all four occasions. But in visitations two, three, and four additional information and instruction also was given to Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>Visitation #2</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>After receiving the initial teachings from Moroni, Joseph marveled greatly at what had been told to him by such an extraordinary messenger. In the midst of his meditation, the room again began to be filled with light and Moroni once more was by his bedside.</p>
<p>The angel commenced and again related the very same things he conveyed during his first visit, without the least variation. He then informed Joseph of great judgments which were coming upon the earth, with great desolations by famine,&nbsp;sword, and pestilence; and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in this generation. At the conclusion of this instruction, the second visitation ended.</p>
<p>The core messages delivered by Moroni in both the first and second appearances were exactly and precisely the same. Please note, however, that in the second interaction a description of future judgments and calamities was added to the initial message. Thus, the content of the first and second messages was both the same and different. In the second visitation, the initial teaching was built upon and added to with supplementary information about important future events.</p>
<p><strong>Visitation #3</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>At this point in the night, the impressions made upon Joseph's mind by the two previous visitations from Moroni were so deep that sleep had fled from his eyes. Then suddenly a third time he beheld the same messenger at his bedside and heard him rehearse or repeat again the same things as before. Interestingly, in this third exchange Moroni added an individual caution to Joseph, telling him that Satan would tempt him to get the golden plates for the purpose of becoming rich. This he forbade Joseph to do and taught him that he must have no other object in view in obtaining the plates but to glorify God. At the conclusion of this instruction, the third visitation ended.</p>
<p>Note once again the pattern&mdash;repeating the core message exactly, and then adding to the original content a very strong and personal warning to young Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>Visitation #4</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The next morning Joseph attempted to perform his customary chores but was so weakened by the miraculous experiences of the previous night that he was unable to work. While laboring together, Joseph's father noticed something clearly was not right with his son and instructed him to return to their home. As Joseph&nbsp;attempted to climb a fence on his way back to the house, he fell on the ground and for a time was quite unconscious of anything.</p>
<p>The first thing Joseph could recollect was a voice speaking to him, calling him by name. Moroni was standing above the boy and again related to him all that he had related the previous night. The angel also commanded Joseph to go to his father and tell him of the vision and commandments which he had received. At the conclusion of this instruction, the fourth visitation ended.</p>
<p>Again in this appearance of Moroni, the fundamental message remained exactly the same. Significant, however, is the addition of a specific commandment to Joseph to tell his father about the visions and instruction he had received.</p>
<p>In each of the four appearances of Moroni to Joseph Smith, the core message was identical. But in a line upon line and precept upon precept pattern of revelation and learning, additional knowledge and instruction were given in the second, third, and fourth manifestations: a foretelling of future events, a personal warning, and a commandment. All of the messages were the same and were different in a pattern of repetitious teaching and learning.</p>
<p><strong>Repetition as a Pattern for Receiving and Recognizing Revelation</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A hallmark in the ministry of any General Authority or auxiliary leader is repetitious teaching. For example, I frequently and repeatedly teach about and testify of the divinity and living reality of our Heavenly Father and His Only Begotten Son; of our resurrected Redeemer; of the basic doctrine, principles, ordinances, and covenants of the Savior's restored gospel; of the reality of the latter-day Restoration; and of the essential nature of priesthood authority and keys. Many times each day and thousands and thousands of times each year I am blessed to bear my apostolic witness concerning the truthfulness of these eternal verities.</p>
<p>My wife, Susan, and I have learned a remarkable revelatory lesson during my years of service in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. As we travel and serve together around the world, Susan records simple notes about the places we visit, the people we meet, and the topics we teach. She has become adept at noticing in various venues the things that are dissimilar in my explanations of the same gospel principles. Susan listens for the statements I have never used before, changes in an explanation, or refinements in the answer to a question. Interestingly, the messages always are the same and always are different.</p>
<p>We have learned to treasure the spiritual gems that are revealed through repetition. The distinctive nuggets of inspiration and spiritual knowledge that flow into our minds and hearts as we repeatedly teach and testify of gospel truths are the product of a line upon line and precept upon precept pattern of revelation. Repetition is a vehicle through which the Holy Ghost can enlighten our minds, influence our hearts, and enlarge our understanding.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard a Sunday School teacher introduce the topic for a lesson and thought, "I already know about this subject?" Have you ever heard a speaker in sacrament meeting identify the theme about which he or she will speak and responded, "Not again?" Have you ever wondered, "Why do Church leaders always address the same basic doctrine and principles in general conference?" Have you ever "checked out" mentally and spiritually because you anticipated an episode of repetitious teaching? We all have, of course. And we need to repent for doing so and more fully appreciate the value of repetition as a means of facilitating revelation.</p>
<p>Consider how often we hear exactly the same words in the ordinance of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, in conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost and confirming a new member of the Church, in the sacramental prayers, and in temple ordinances. I find it especially instructive that repetition is such an important aspect of the essential and most sacred ordinances in which we participate as members of the Savior's restored Church. Repetitious learning and teaching as a line upon line and precept upon precept pattern of revelation can invite the Holy Ghost to renew, enrich, and enlarge the knowledge we already have obtained; it also can bring new knowledge and understanding into our minds and hearts.</p>
<p><strong>A Repetitious Warning and Promise</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Given the emphasis placed thus far in my message on the value of repetitious learning and teaching, you should not be surprised that I now am going to repeat a warning and a promise I have given on this campus on other occasions. Some history and context should help you to understand my reasons for repeating the warning.</p>
<p>I began my service on this campus in the summer of 1997, at what was then the largest private two-year college in the United States&mdash;Ricks College. In September of that year President James E. Faust, second counselor in the First Presidency, visited the school to dedicate the new John Taylor Building. Elder Henry B. Eyring of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the Commissioner of Church Education was President Faust's companion for that special occasion.</p>
<p>Elder Eyring arrived in Rexburg one day early to review several matters with me and to ensure that everything was in order for President Faust. When I picked up Elder Eyring at the airport, I learned that he had just returned from a two-week assignment in South America. He obviously was tired from his travels, and I was anxious to get him to our home so he could rest.</p>
<p>As we drove to Rexburg, I asked Elder Eyring if he was interested in quickly walking through the completed Taylor Building. He answered that he was&nbsp;interested, and we spent approximately 15 minutes inspecting the classrooms and other facilities.</p>
<p>Our last stop was the Taylor Chapel, and Elder Eyring stood near the pulpit on the stand and surveyed the seating area for quite a long time. After a few minutes, I asked him: "Elder Eyring, what are you thinking about?" He answered with this profound and penetrating observation: "I am thinking about how much we do for so few and how little we do for so many." He then continued, "The tithing of the people I just visited in South America and from good people all over the world paid for this facility. And most of the people who have made this beautiful facility possible will never see or step foot in a building like this. That is what I am thinking about."</p>
<p>That experience and the lesson I learned from Elder Eyring influenced me greatly during the time I served at BYU-Idaho. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has invested millions of tithing dollars over the last 15 years to upgrade the BYU-Idaho campus and programs. Such expenditures have been made to enhance your learning, developmental, and employment experiences. Please do not take these sacred resources, your choice opportunities, and this beautiful campus for granted. Please do not think that you are somehow more deserving or worthy. Please be grateful for the singular chance you have to learn and work here and for the responsibility that rests upon you as one who has been the recipient of great blessings.</p>
<p>In October of 2006, I returned to BYU-Idaho as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve to speak in a devotional and to preside at the groundbreaking ceremony for this BYU-Idaho Center and the Manwaring Center addition. I repeat again the warning and promise I expressed on that occasion.</p>
<p>"In the authority of the holy Apostleship, I now raise a voice of warning and make a solemn promise. If the day ever were to come that intellectual arrogance, a lack of appreciation, and a spirit of demanding entitlement take root on this campus&mdash;among the students, faculty, employees or the administration, or within the community&mdash;then in that day the Spirit of Ricks will be well on the way to being extinguished&mdash;and the heavenly influence and blessings that have prospered this institution and the people associated with it will be withdrawn. Conversely, as long as intellectual modesty, humility, gratitude, obedience, and frugality continue to characterize those who learn and serve at BYU-Idaho, then this university will shine forth ever brighter as a beacon of righteousness and of inspired educational innovation" (David A. Bednar, The Spirit and Purposes of Gathering, Oct. 2006, 10-11).</p>
<p>I repeated that identical warning and promise at the dedicatory service of this building in December of 2010. Today I emphasize, affirm, and renew that warning and promise for a third time.</p>
<p><strong>Why Repeat This Warning and Promise a Third Time?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>You understandably may be asking yourself the question, why repeat this message a third time?</p>
<p>I am not the same man who warned and promised in 2006 and 2010. I am the same man, but I am different. I have traveled the earth for more than a decade and visited countless homes of faithful Church members&mdash;the rich and the poor, the meek and the humble, the educated and the uneducated. Those converted and consecrated Latter-day Saints have changed me.</p>
<p>I participate every year in the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes with the First Presidency, the other members of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric. I witness firsthand the watch care exercised by the leaders of this&nbsp;Church over the widow's mite that makes it possible for you to be a student or an employee at this university. Those experiences have changed me.</p>
<p>As sincere and earnest as I was in 2006 when I first delivered that warning and promise, I am many times more focused and intense about it today than I was then.</p>
<p>This campus is not the same campus it was in 1997 or 2006 or 2010. The campus is the same but different. I have watched for many years as the Lord has blessed and prospered the students, staff, and faculty of this remarkable university. The facilities are functional and beautiful. The students, staff, and faculty are faithful and diligent. So much has been accomplished in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>And precisely because you and the university are being blessed and prospered, the warning and promise are needed a third time. In particular, a warning is most needed when we do not think we need to be warned. Using the language of the Old Testament prophet Haggai, I invite you to carefully and prayerfully "consider your ways" (Haggai 1:5, 7).</p>
<p>These insidious spiritual flaws can develop in us so subtly that we may not recognize or respond to them. As you ponder these questions sincerely and with real intent, I promise the Holy Ghost will help you to see yourself as you "really&nbsp;are" (Jacob 4:13) and to identify both the things you presently are doing well and the course corrections you need to make in your life.</p>
<p>I believe consecrated people like you in this sacred and set apart place, with the help of the Lord and by the power of His Holy Spirit, can attenuate the pride cycle so prominently highlighted throughout the Book of Mormon. You can prosper and remain submissive. You can succeed and avoid arrogance. You can receive blessings with gratitude and not be seduced by a sense of self-serving entitlement. You can increase the intensity of the righteous light that shines forth from Brigham Young University-Idaho.</p>
<p><strong>Blessing and Testimony</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I love you, and I love BYU-Idaho. I invoke the Lord's blessings upon you, both individually and collectively&mdash;even the spiritual capacities and gifts that will be necessary for you to overcome and avoid the pride that so often follows periods of great prosperity.</p>
<p>I testify of and witness the living reality of our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son. I know Jesus the Christ is our resurrected and living Savior. And I witness that the Father and the Son appeared to and instructed Joseph Smith, thus initiating the restoration of the gospel in the dispensation of the fulness of times. Of these truths I testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>Susan Kae Robinson Bednar was born and reared in Afton, Wyoming.&nbsp; She is the daughter of Kay and Nyla Clement Robinson.</p>
<p>Sister Bednar graduated from Brigham Young University with a B.A. in Elementary Education.&nbsp; She taught first grade for two years and was involved with institutions of higher education with Elder Bednar while he served as a faculty member at Texas Tech University and the University of Arkansas and as the president of Brigham Young University - Idaho.</p>
<p>In the Church Sister Bednar has served as Primary president, Primary chorister, young women president, gospel doctrine teacher, and Lambda Delta Sigma sorority adviser.</p>
<p>Elder and Sister Bednar were married in the Salt Lake Temple in 1975 and they are the parents of three sons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Every summer our entire family enjoys a reunion together at the beach. Each day Elder Bednar and I conduct a devotional with our grandchildren, and then they teach their parents what we have taught them. A few years ago, we examined the account in Matthew, chapter 14 where Peter walked on the water.<br /><br />As we cut out stick figures of Jesus and Peter and then showed the grandchildren how to make a boat out of a piece of paper, we discussed how Peter had faith to get out of the boat and start walking on the water toward Jesus. We also pointed out that when Peter became distracted by the wind and the waves and began to sink, Jesus stretched out his hand to save him.<br /><br />As we started cleaning up, our six-year-old granddaughter said, "Grandma, please do not put things away yet. I want to write something on my boat." She wrote these words, "Look to Jesus."<br /><br />In the short time we have together, I pray the Spirit will strengthen our desire to have the faith to get out of the boat and keep our eyes fixed on Jesus.<br /><br />Before I began my freshman year at BYU, I was given this timeless advice: Do not hesitate to branch out into fields you are interested in, and make sure to include your Heavenly Father in your educational plans. At that time in my life, branching out meant taking classes and getting involved in activities that would stretch me and force me out of my comfort zone. "Jumping out of the boat" experiences, as I like to call them, prepare us for what lies ahead.<br /><br />Take a moment to reflect back on your life. How has a decision or accomplishment in the past been a preparation for today? I had such a preparatory experience right here on this campus.<br /><br />Shortly after Elder Bednar became the President of BYU-Idaho, we spoke at a multi-stake devotional. At the end of my remarks, I expressed love for the students and naively commented, "I wish I could take each of you home with me and feed you ice cream and cookies." Well, the next Monday evening we heard a knock on our door. To our surprise, on the doorstep stood a group of students with ice cream and cookies in hand ready to take me up on my offer. That very night commenced the tradition of Home Evening with the President and his wife that has continued on this campus for more than 18 years.</p>
<p>I must admit that Home Evening was a "jumping out of the boat" experience for me. I expected we would teach a prepared and scripted lesson, and have complete control over what happened, how it happened, and when it happened. But my husband suggested another idea. He wanted to invite the students to ask questions. When he proposed this concept, I felt uncomfortable, unsure, and started to cry. This was way out of my comfort zone. Fear of failure and lack of faith gripped my heart. Reassuring me, Elder Bednar remarked that I could always decline his invitation to answer. And I did say no, especially at first. I'm grateful for those Home Evenings that caused me to prayerfully reach deep within myself and plead for heavenly help to replace fear with faith. Over time I became less hesitant to answer questions and more reliant on the Lord.<br /><br />This past May, Elder Bednar and I were invited to participate in a live, worldwide Face to Face activity with the youth of the Church. Tethered together by the spirit of the Lord and technology, young people from all over the world asked us heart-felt questions in real time without us knowing in advance what the questions would be. As I contemplated later about this opportunity, I realized that past Home Evenings with the students at BYU-Idaho had been a preparation for this future event.<br /><br />I pray that as you have opportunities to be stretched emotionally, physically, mentally, and spiritually, you will not hesitate to demonstrate your faith and "jump out of the boat," knowing that when you don't think you can do hard things, the Savior will stretch out his hand to assist you, just as he rescued me. Look to Jesus with confidence and know the life-lessons you are learning here and now truly will prepare you for a wonderful and remarkable future.<br /><br />I have a testimony that God answers prayers; that Jesus is our strength and our salvation; and that revelation from the Holy Ghost comes as thoughts to our minds and feelings to our hearts. I testify that God speaks his mind and will today through men we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators. I know Elder Bednar has been called of God to be a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world. May you listen to and be blessed by his counsel today; in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today&mdash;to share with you some thoughts and ideas that have found significance in my life. My purpose today is to inspire you&mdash;to invite you to recognize your worth as an individual and your potential as a human being. To have you understand that much of what you will become in life is directly related to the choices you make. Specifically, I want to address the influence of culture upon you; both in what you choose and what you contribute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February of 1842, Joseph Smith received a request from John Wentworth, a newspaper editor for the <em>Chicago Democrat</em>. Mr. Wentworth was asking for information for a friend, George Barstow, who was writing a history of the state of New Hampshire. Mr. Wentworth wanted to know, first hand, concerning the beliefs and history of the Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his response, the Prophet Joseph composed a group of thirteen paragraphs, which have become known as the Articles of Faith. In a very clear and concise way, he articulated the basic framework of what we believe as members of the Church. The Articles of Faith comment on the Godhead and the organization of the Church as well as other important theological principles. However, at the end of the document, Joseph seemed to change his direction slightly, leaving organization and doctrine and focusing instead on issues of character and culture. I believe that the Prophet Joseph wanted Mr. Wentworth to know the &ldquo;heart&rdquo; of the Mormon people. He seemed eager to demonstrate to a curious world that the Latter-day Saints were a kind, and law-abiding people, seeking beauty and refinement in their lives and looking to better themselves in order to find acceptance among those who possessed similar goals. He attempted this by paraphrasing the Apostle Paul, and then added a very significant statement:</p>
<p>We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul, "We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.</p>
<p>I am convinced that in that final sentence of the Wentworth Letter, the Prophet Joseph laid a heavy responsibility upon each of us as members of the Church, and especially upon you, the youth of the Church, since you are those who are just now in the process of making the important choices that will define who you will become. It is the responsibility to seek the best that the world offers us, to surround ourselves with experiences and activities that defy the limits we sometimes feel regarding peer pressure or popular culture; to work to recognize and identify those things in life that bring growth and fulfillment. In short, to drink deeply from the well of what life has to offer. And therein lies the problem. Life offers much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my role as a teacher in the visual arts, I deal with cultural issues and their impact upon society. I discuss with students the daily choices they make from the vast array that is available to them. If we liken some of the cultural choices that surround us to food items, we can quickly see that if we are not careful, we can find ourselves unwittingly filling up on the corndogs and donut holes of life. If we exercise little or no discretion in the choices we make, what we do for entertainment and relaxation can resemble feeding from a barnyard trough&mdash;full of things that simply reflect a world of declining morals, harsh attitudes, selfish behaviors and worthless fascination. Sometimes it seems we choose these things by default, because they come to us so easily.&nbsp; They require nothing but consumption. They do not raise our level of consciousness and seldom provide any nutrition or growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we choose well, culture can lift and inspire us. The gastronomical equivalents here could be: filet mignon, pasta primavera, or French onion soup. (These are a few of my favorites; you can substitute your own.) Here we find not only nourishment to the body, but to the mind and the soul as well. We also experience a higher level of consciousness. We can experience profound ideas and meaningful insights into what it means to be alive. However, recognizing the better and more meaningful things in life requires work and preparation. That is what separates low culture from things that are &ldquo;<em>virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy&hellip;&rdquo;</em> We have to work a little for things that are better, not just unthinkingly consume that which is placed in front of us. Now, I don't want you to think that you or I can never dive into a big bowl of Frosted Flakes, but the key is to avoid a steady diet of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you think about it, there is a fundamental law that demands that progress in anything be the result of effort. Stasis never promotes growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember in the seventh grade reading the classic book by Charles Dicken's, <em>Great Expectations</em>. The thought of reading that book worried me because it seemed large and complicated. Very likely it was just a little beyond my ability to fully comprehend. However, it was the one that was left on the table for me after all the other students had chosen a book. As I reluctantly opened it and began to turn its pages a wonderful thing happened; I was pulled into the richness of it. I envisioned the landscapes and the room interiors. I saw the faces of the characters in my own mind&mdash;Pip, and Estella, and Miss Havisham, and Magwitch, and Jaggers. The story became real to me. The suspense, the joy, the heartache, the reconciliation became understandable. I think the book helped to change me from a child into a young adult. Why? Because it made me work&mdash;and therefore helped me grow. I had unknowingly tested Joseph&rsquo;s admonition&mdash;I had sought out of one of &ldquo;the best books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though I doubt I fully realized it then, an important lesson learned from reading that classic book was that the arts possess great power to influence us. I have since come to more fully realize that cultural pursuits significantly affect our thoughts and our behavior. If you are like me, the most immediate example of the power of art is through music. Music can almost instantaneously affect my mood. Music for me is very much less a conscious, intellectual concern, but instead a very sensory experience. The arts on a very fundamental level can inform us about how we feel about life. This is why it becomes important for us to understand their influence, so that we are free to enjoy and appreciate, but less likely to be manipulated by those with questionable motives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The artwork placed in this very building, the BYU-Idaho Center, was done with great care&mdash;intending to have an effect on all who enter. When planning the building, it was determined that each of the three levels would have a theme: the upper level is the Book of Mormon, the lower level honors our pioneer heritage, the main level of the building displays the cycle of paintings by the classical Danish artist Carl Bloch depicting the life of Christ. Because of the scale of the building, these paintings, which are in reproduction form, are presented much larger than they actually exist, adding to their impact upon the viewer. Former BYU-Idaho president Kim B. Clark wanted students to adopt a reverent attitude as they passed from the activities side of the building to this large congregational hall. He understood the influence these works could have upon the students and others. President Clark related that when President Henry B. Eyring visited campus to participate in the dedication of this building, he entered the building at the south entrance as many of you did today. Upon crossing the land bridge to the main level foyer he stopped. As he stood there, tears formed in his eyes. He was still for several minutes. He then remarked to President Clark regarding the emotional impact that cycle of paintings depicting the life of Christ had upon him. He had felt the power of great art. Now, it is generally known that President Eyring, as a former president of this institution, has a special place in his heart for this campus. What may not be as commonly known is that President Eyring is himself an artist. He frequently carries a miniature watercolor kit with him. I have seen several of his watercolor sketches and they are of excellent quality. Through his frequent association with artistic and cultural things, it is likely that President Eyring has become sensitized to the artistic endeavors of others, and could appreciate fully what he saw before him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a sad truth that if people do not know that there is something better for them, then they may never aspire to it. If we do not challenge ourselves in any significant way, we will never succeed at anything difficult. We will not take the accomplishments that should be ours from childhood into adulthood, where they can be used to bless the lives of so many others. Desiring to feel the significant in life&mdash;shouldn't this be part of the character of the LDS people? Joseph Smith seemed to think so. I believe that in his final sentence to John Wentworth that he envisioned a people who were schooled enough, sensitive enough, wise enough and engaged enough to be able to tell the difference between things that were worthy of their attention and things that were not. It is likely that we can agree that we live in a world of increasing distraction. It is my fear that we are becoming less able to distinguish between the exceptional and the mundane&mdash;those things that are truly superior and special from the glut of sensory overload provided by social media and popular culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his classic address entitled: "Good, Better, Best" Elder Dallin H. Oaks admonished:</p>
<p>Consider how we use our time in the choices we make in viewing television, playing video games, surfing the Internet, or reading books and magazines. Of course it is good to view wholesome entertainment, or obtain interesting information. But not everything of that sort is worth the portion of our life we give to obtain it. Some things are better, and others are best. When the Lord told us to seek learning, He said 'Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom (D&amp;C 88:118).'</p>
<p>We live in a world, which routinely confuses notoriety with achievement, substitutes sensationalism for accomplishment, and rewards outlandish behavior in lieu of significant contribution. Sadly, there are many who cannot, or will not, recognize the difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great deal of how we enjoy the beauties of life stem from the attitude that we have toward it. Barring unforeseen circumstances most of us will live seven or eight decades or more on earth. Imagine living on a cultural plane that made you oblivious to the wonderful possibilities and potential that this world had to offer? How would you then view earth life in the hereafter when it was too late to do anything about it? Hence, your attitude becomes important as you participate in the artistic and cultural contributions of others, as well as committing yourself to the development of your own talents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am reminded of a story that involves a famous artist named Robert Henri. Like most aspiring art students in the 1800s Robert trained in Paris at the Academie Julien or the Ecole de Beaux Artes. Substitute yourself for Robert Henri in the following account&mdash;and see if it sounds familiar:</p>
<p>I once lived in the top of a house, in a little room in Paris. I was a student. My place was a romance. It was a mansard room with a little square window that looked out over housetops with pink chimneys. I could see the Institute, the Pantheon and the Tower of St. Jacques. The tiles on the floor were red, and some of them were broken and got out of place, but there was a little stove, a washbasin, a pitcher and piles of my drawings. My bed was a cot. It was a wonderful place. I cooked fine meals of macaroni and eggs on my little stove and ate with the window open. I kept my Camembert cheese out on the ledge. I studied and thought and made compositions, and wrote letters home full of hope of someday being an artist. It was wonderful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But days came when hopes looked black and my art student&rsquo;s paradise was turned into a dirty little room with broken tiles. Ashes fell from the stove and it was all hopelessly poor. I was tired of camembert and eggs and macaroni and there wasn&rsquo;t a shade of significance in those delicate little chimneys, or the Pantheon, the Institute or even the Tower of St. Jacques&hellip;</p>
<p>Now, what had changed? Nothing and everything. Though the circumstances remained identical, his whole existence seemed precariously balanced on the caprice of mood. &nbsp;Seeing the beautiful and seeking the good are skills developed as we recognize that there will be occasional bleak periods that will test our resolve and endurance, but the quest to gain judgment and discretion regarding what we will allow into our lives begins now and lasts for as long as we are alive; so don't allow yourself to be easily derailed. If you make a mistake or two, its okay; just keep trying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Thirteenth Article of Faith requires us to do more than avoid the evil we see in the world. It requires us to actively seek out things that are good, to expand our experience and our minds, and most importantly, to develop our own talents; so much so that the good, the excellent, and the superior will crowd out not only the evil, but will replace the mundane, the vulgar and the superficial, and yes, even the boring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, you may be asking yourself at this point, "He wants me to experience higher culture and make choices that will enrich my life, but he hasn't given me a list of wonderful movies or great songs." I have steadfastly avoided telling you which movies to watch or what music to listen to. I quickly realized as a young man that my music was not my parent's music, and I am not persuaded that anything has changed from that day to this. The point of all of this is that you have to choose for yourself&mdash;that is the burden and the beauty of life. Let me, however, suggest several principles which may help you govern yourselves in these matters:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Remember, that there <em>are</em> "conspiring men in the last days"&mdash;those who are much more interested in making money than making art. Seek quality in every form of art, be it music, film, or story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Try to poke your head up above the confining cloud of your immediate surroundings. Take a chance on something that you would not normally experience&mdash;especially if you hear good things about it. It won't kill you to experience a classic; be it music, movie, or play. It is classic for a reason&mdash;probably because it strikes a universal chord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) You already know what is right and what is wrong. You have been learning that since Primary. In my opinion, styles of music and subjects for movies are not inherently good or bad, but messages they send can be. Learn the difference between the subject of the movie or music and the message it sends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, as important as seeking out that which is of good report is, it is also our responsibility to use our own talents to replenish the pool of praiseworthy things that others may draw from. We may sometimes feel that we have no talents or little to offer. If you don't remember anything else I say here today I want you to remember this: everyone, <em>everyone</em>, has a talent, an ability, an aptitude, a gift&mdash;it only waits to be discovered and developed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord told Joseph Smith:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"&hellip;and to every man is given a gift&hellip;to some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby." (D&amp;C 46:11-12)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we are timid in the recognition and use of our own talents, feeling at times that they are meager or unremarkable. There are always those who will be more or less talented than one's self. Comparison of our talents with others often invites disappointment. The real test is the work and desire that brings any talents our Heavenly Father has given us to fruition, and in appreciating the talents that he has given to others. Striving to "be the best" can prove to be hollow and unrewarding&mdash;driven as it often is by competition and ego. However, striving always to "do your best" honors the talents and gifts that have been given you by Heavenly Father, recognizing that your contribution, great or small, can be laid upon the altar for the benefit of others and the glory of God. That is where fulfillment in life lies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impact of our contribution, however, very often has much more to do with our desire than the level of our talent. President Boyd K. Packer has said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Inspiration can come to those whose talents are barely adequate, and their contribution will be felt for generations; and the Church and kingdom of God will move forward just a little more easily because they have been here."</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>It is likely that most of you have not heard of Naomi Randall. She is not well known as a great songwriter or lyricist. She was a member of the Primary Board in 1957. She was asked by the Primary to write a song that would teach children about their relationship to Heavenly Father. This is her account:</p>
<p>I got down on my knees and prayed aloud, pleading that our Heavenly Father would let me know the right words. Around 2 a.m. I awakened and began to think about a song. Words came to my mind. I immediately got up and began to write the words down as they had come to me. Three verses and a chorus were soon formed. I gratefully surveyed the work, drank (in) the message of the words and returned to my bedroom where I knelt before my Heavenly Father to say 'Thank you.'</p>
<p>Sister Randall had composed the children's hymn "I Am a Child of God."&nbsp; Her friend Mildred Petit furnished the tune. As simple and as humble as that little song is, it has been translated into 90 languages and is sung by congregations worldwide. It has been performed by the Tabernacle Choir and is arguably one of the most recognized songs of the Restoration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would commend to you the format that was revealed by Sister Randall's description as a recipe for any artistic creation, religious or otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) She did not doubt her ability to do it.</p>
<p>2) She asked the Lord's help.</p>
<p>3) She thought about her task.</p>
<p>4) When inspiration struck she immediately set to work.</p>
<p>5) She reviewed what she had done.</p>
<p>6) She returned thanks to God for his help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, in conclusion I would want each of you to feel as I do that the world is a place of unlimited beauty and opportunity. Yes, we should avoid unrighteousness in our lives and recognize the evil that exists in the world, but in truth we are required to do more than that. We should embrace goodness and beauty. We should seek culture. We should enthusiastically pursue opportunities that will educate us and better us. Only then can we say that we have been true to the Prophet Joseph's hope that we have sought the better things in life.</p>

<p>We should stand amazed at what mankind has accomplished through the inspiration of God every time we travel in a jet airplane, stand at the base of a towering skyscraper, survey the mighty span of a modern bridge, view a wonderful play or watch an inspiring movie, listen to beautiful music or see magnificent art. At these moments you will feel the joy of being alive. These fruits of our humanity and our divinity should represent to us a fundamental triumph over satanic influence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> the "heart" of the Mormon people? I hope it is not one of cultural blandness. I hope it is not one of not caring or not trying. I hope it is not one of succumbing to the endless distraction that leads to arriving nowhere. Can we honestly say we are fulfilling Joseph Smith's description of us to Mr. Wentworth that we as a people and as individuals are seeking virtue, beauty and excellence? I hope we can. I hope we are. I hope we will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters it is my prayer that we will remember the Prophet Joseph's words&mdash;that we will not only seek out the best that this world has to offer us, but that we will in turn contribute our best as well. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How very grateful I am to be here today. For nearly 10 years my wife and I have had the privilege of serving on this campus. We have grown to love all that this school stands for. How we treasure our association with such outstanding students and the opportunity to learn from the wisdom and example of committed faculty and employees. I want to thank the administration for allowing us to be involved over such a long period of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It has been such a blessing to us and our family. I love devotionals and the spirit that each of you bring. Devotionals have had a significant impact on my life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During my freshman year at BYU, my testimony blossomed. I developed a deep love for the Savior, the prophet Joseph Smith, and the restoration of the gospel, and I had a real desire to serve a mission. The fall semester at that time, ended late in January but, my 19th birthday was not until the end of March. I was confused about my timing and spent many hours in fasting and prayer to know the Lord&rsquo;s will. By Christmas I still had not received an answer; so I registered for another semester.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the second day of the semester, I was on my way to the field house for the first devotional when I received a strong impression, &ldquo;Sit in front.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Elder A. Theodore Tuttle of the Quorum of the Seventy was the speaker and the first words out of his mouth were, &ldquo;If there is any one in this audience who is thinking about going on a mission, go now!&rdquo; There was my answer<strong>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the devotional I called my parents, checked out of school and, before returning to my home in Idaho, I met with both my Bishop and Stake President. Then, as was required in those days, I drove to Salt Lake for an interview with a General Authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The authority I was assigned to was A. Theodore Tuttle, the very man who had spoken at the devotional a week earlier. I told Elder Tuttle of my experience and he said, &ldquo;As I arose to give my talk I was impressed to give that advice.&rdquo; The rest of the talk had nothing to do with missionary work.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I tell this story for two reasons: first, to emphasize how important devotionals can be in your lives if you come prepared and open to be taught by the Holy Ghost and second, to demonstrate that God is aware of each of you and your desires. He will answer your prayers and fulfill the righteous desires of your hearts. I know this is true!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are taught in the Doctrine and Covenants 112:10, &ldquo;Be thou humble and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand and give thee answers to thy prayers.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>
<p>How can we qualify to receive this promise? In Psalms 37:4 we read, &ldquo;Delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What are the desires of your heart? Are they in harmony with your spiritual goals? Ask yourself, &ldquo;If your desires are granted, where will they take you? Are those desires being influenced by the Lord through the Holy Ghost or by the world?&rdquo; If a course correction is needed and you are humble and ask sincerely, the Lord will help you make those necessary adjustments.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once our desires are in order, we must build our lives on a firm, unchanging foundation, the foundation of Jesus Christ. Helaman counseled his own sons, &ldquo;And now my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea when all his hail, and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build, they can not fall.&rdquo; <sup>3</sup> What a great promise.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We know trials will come and temptations are all around us, but we can be prepared, guided and protected by building our foundation on Jesus Christ his life his teachings, his plan for us and his Atonement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You must understand the Atonement. The price has been paid for your sins and the path to forgiveness is through honest and sincere repentance. If you have established a firm foundation and are striving to live as the Savior taught, you can have true, unwavering confidence that the Lord will lead you by the hand and help you achieve the righteous desires of your heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of you have been born into families where a foundation in the gospel has been taught and practiced. Others have not enjoyed a strong gospel background. Regardless of your heritage, you can decide for yourself and your own family where your devotion will lie and to whom you will look for guidance. Each<strong> </strong>of you can become a &ldquo;transition person,&rdquo; by choosing a righteous path for yourself and your posterity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My wife&rsquo;s parents, Henry and Ella Poelman were &ldquo;transition people.&rdquo; Both Henry and Ella came from somewhat uncommitted families who were still learning to consecrate their lives to the teachings of the Church. Henry and Ella each made great personal sacrifices to complete their high school education and had no hope for college. At an appropriate time they were engaged to be married and set their wedding date.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One night, the Bishop asked to meet with Henry. Henry and Ella drove together to the church and Ella waited in the car. During the interview the Bishop asked Henry if he would serve a mission. When Henry shared this request with Ella, they had a major decision to make. They found a secluded place and knelt together in prayer to counsel with the Lord. The decision was made that night that they would build their life on the Savior with a total commitment to do His will. That decision has made all the difference.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Henry served two and a half years in the Netherlands. Upon his return Henry and Ella were married in the temple, and raised six faithful children. Each of you can be a &ldquo;transition person.&rdquo; Your choices can bless the lives of your children and generations, to come, as promised, even to the third and fourth generation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once your life is built on the foundation of Jesus Christ, you must be worthy to receive answers to your prayers and be directed by the Spirit through revelation. Julie B. Beck, former General President of the Relief Society taught, &ldquo;The ability to qualify for, receive and act upon personal revelation is the single most important skill that can be acquired in this lifetime.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><sup>&nbsp;</sup></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Next to the Atonement, the gift of personal revelation through the Holy Ghost is one of the most powerful gifts the Lord could give us. The Holy Ghost knows all things and can reveal to us all things we need to do to fulfill our personal mission. Personal revelation is your lifeline to the guidance of the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In Doctrine &amp; Covenants 121:45-46 the Lord tells us how we can have the power of the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>&ldquo;</em>Let thy bowels also be full of charity toward all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the Priesthood shall distill upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever<em>.&rdquo; </em><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once again, what a great promise. If virtue garnishes your thoughts unceasingly, then your confidence will be strong and you can know that God will direct you. With a foundation built upon Christ and his Atonement and with the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, you will be blessed to make good decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You must have a firm testimony that you have been foreordained to fulfill a specific mission during this earth life experience. You were &ldquo;called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of [your] exceeding faith and good works&rdquo;<sup>6</sup> It is your challenge in this life to come to know and understand the specific mission assigned to you. Each choice you make can lead you closer to or farther from accomplishing that mission. As President Russell M. Nelson recently taught, &ldquo;&hellip;you must learn to do hard things &hellip;even impossible things&rdquo;.<sup> 7 </sup>That is what you have been put on earth to do in these last stages of the last days. As you partner with the Lord nothing will be impossible that is in harmony with his plan and will. He will guide you in the journey if you seek His help.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Decisions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You are at a point in your life when you are making some very important decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How can you gain the faith and testimony you will need to do those impossible things?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What do you need to study to effectively prepare for your mission?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of your decisions will affect both your mission and the happiness you experience as you devote a lifetime to accomplishing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Who should you marry? How can you make your spouse a true partner in your journey?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When should you start a family? How can you manage your responsibilities amid so many demands on your time?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You must have the faith that God will lead you and answer your prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Turn to Him and seek His will in your decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Do your best to qualify for personal revelation by living a virtuous, Christ-Centered life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You don&rsquo;t have to be perfect, but you must have a strong desire for His guidance and try your best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Marriage and Family</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The establishment of an eternal family is important to the Lord&rsquo;s plan and to your happiness. It tells us in The Family: A Proclamation to the World that &ldquo;marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator&rsquo;s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God&rsquo;s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force&hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children.<strong> &lsquo;</strong>Children are an heritage of the Lord&rsquo; (Psalm 127:3)...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&hellip;Husbands and wives&mdash;mothers and fathers&mdash;will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Partner with the Lord</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What a great responsibility it is to find a companion, then to marry and create an eternal family. It is essential that we partner with the Lord in these crucial decisions. I testify that through your faith and obedience, God will direct thy path and give thee answers to thy prayers. Please listen to the Lord and His prophets. Do not be influenced by the values and voices of the world. Prayerfully and with the Lord&rsquo;s guidance, choose your love and then love your<strong> </strong>choice<strong>; </strong>then establish together an appropriate relationship, one of trust and equality.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A man must treat his wife and a wife must treat her husband with kindness and respect. As problems or challenges arise, they must be solved together with each one expressing his or her own feelings while the other listens with an open mind, and strives to understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Value the Difference </strong></p>
<p>Are men and women different? Of course they are. The differences are intentional. So, do you truly value that difference? Each spouse brings to a marriage a unique and valuable perspective and together a man and wife can make much better decisions. I know that this is true.<strong> </strong>Some of the worst decisions I have made in life were a result of not considering my wife&rsquo;s concerns. We have come to understand that when we both feel good about a path, we can unite in our pursuit of that path and accept the consequences, knowing it is in accordance with the Lord&rsquo;s plan. This is the pattern of the brethren as they counsel together and a good one to follow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Priesthood Leadership Clarified</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes we are confused about the Priesthood and the responsibility men have to use it to bless and lead their families. This can open the door to unrighteous dominion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">President Boyd K. Packer stated,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the home it is a partnership with husband and wife equally yoked together, sharing in decisions, always working together<strong>.</strong> While the husband, the father, has responsibility to provide worthy and inspired leadership, his wife is neither behind him nor ahead of him but at his side.<sup>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then, as a family grows, President James E. Faust explained, &ldquo;Every father is to his family a patriarch and every mother a matriarch as coequals in their distinctive parental roles."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Having Children </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When a couple marries, their desire to follow the Lord&rsquo;s plan will requires them to make choices concerning having children. Elder Neil L. Anderson gave wonderful counsel to us in the 2011 October General Conference. He stated,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is a crowning privilege of a husband and wife who are able to bear children to provide mortal bodies for these spirit children of God. We believe in families, and we believe in children&hellip; The prophets in our day have declared &lsquo;The first commandment that God gave Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God&rsquo;s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force,&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We express deep gratitude for the enormous faith shown by husbands and wives (especially our wives) in their willingness to have children.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My wife and I see that faith demonstrated in your lives. We are touched by your faithfulness as you share the care of your children and support each other in your demanding schedules of school, work, church callings, etc. How we love you young people.<strong> </strong>You are such an example of faith and obedience. There are few your age in the world who demonstrate such great faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Decisions Regarding Children </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Elder Anderson gave this very wise counsel, &ldquo;When to have a child and how many children to have are private decisions to be made between a husband and wife and the Lord. These are sacred decisions&mdash;decisions that should be made with sincere prayer and acted on with great faith.&rdquo; <sup>12</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The world will discourage you from having children or encourage you to seek other goals first. Many do not understand the privilege and blessing it is to have a family. Elder Anderson shared a comment made on the blog of a Christian woman of another faith. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;She wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&ldquo;Motherhood is not a hobby. It is a calling. You do not collect children because you find them cuter than stamps. It is not something to do if you can squeeze the time in&hellip; It is what God gave you time for.&rdquo; <sup>13</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Managing small children is a demanding, often an exhausting and selfless task.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another story tells of a young mother who once boarded a bus with her seven children.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The bus driver asked,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>&ldquo;</em>Are these all yours, lady? Or is it a picnic?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&ldquo;They are all mine.&rdquo; she replied, &hellip;&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s no picnic.&rdquo;<sup>14</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are many demands and sacrifices associated with having a family, but life was not meant to be a picnic. It was meant to be a challenging journey, a test demanding great effort and dedication, which gives us the opportunity to grow. We are proving to the Lord our commitment to His plan and our willingness to make personal sacrifices for the good of others.&nbsp; It is an opportunity to prove ourselves worthy to have spirit children of our own. As we are obedient to these commandments both the earthly and the eternal rewards are indescribable. We are blessed with a fullness of love and joy that cannot fully be understood unless it is experienced.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Early Pothier Family</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Marva and I were blessed to be able to have children and we are grateful beyond measure that we had each one. The challenge of having lots of children and little money made sacrifice and selflessness a necessity but these became our favorite trials and have brought our most treasured rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Doctor Story</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Elder James O. Mason, a former General Authority Seventy told of a meeting he had with Elder Spencer W. Kimball. He explained his plans to become a doctor which left no alternative but to postpone having a family. Elder Kimball listened patiently and then responded in a soft voice, &ldquo;Brother Mason, would the Lord want you to break one of His important commandments in order for you to become a doctor? With the help of the Lord, you can have your family and still become a doctor. Where is your faith?&rdquo;<sup>15</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just like paying tithing, brothers and sisters, it is a matter not of time, money or convenience; it is a question of faith. Elder Mason did become a doctor and added two more children to his family while in school.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the greatest regrets some of our older acquaintances have expressed is that they did not have more children. In his last conference talk Elder L. Tom Perry declared,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&ldquo;The older I get, the more I realize that family is the center of life and is the key to eternal happiness.&rdquo; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><sup>&nbsp;</sup></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Not All Are Able</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Not all are blessed with the opportunity to have children, or the number of children they desire. This is a source of much pain, sorrow and adjustment. We need to be<strong> </strong>thoughtful in our interactions and never judge another&rsquo;s motives, decisions or circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The size of families and timing of children must be very carefully and prayerfully decided between a husband and wife, and the Lord. The Lord knows your mission, trials and capacity and will guide you and give you answers to your prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Through your selfless choices to follow the Lord&rsquo;s plan you can feel confident that He will direct your life and make you equal to your assigned mission while enjoying the beautiful fruits of family life. You must live by faith, not fear. As President Gordon B. Hinckley promised, &ldquo;It will all work out,&rdquo;<sup>17 </sup>and it does.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Personal Testimony </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our personal experience has been one great miracle. It defies all worldly logic. With a very basic education I have been blessed with opportunities beyond my wildest dreams, which has made it possible for me to support my wife and our nine children.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&ldquo;For eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for them that love him.&rdquo; <sup>18</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fruits and Blessings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What pure joy we experience as we gather our family and see the loving, relationships of siblings and grandchildren. It gives us great satisfaction and is one of the most beautiful fruits of gospel life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&ldquo;Happiness is the object and design of our existence; Joseph Smith explained, and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness and keeping all the commandments of God&rdquo;<sup>19</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Summary and Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Brothers and Sister, &ldquo;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding, acknowledge him in all things and he shall direct thy path.&rdquo;<sup> 20</sup> How very grateful we are that we listened to counsel, and were prayerfully directed by the Spirit beyond our own understanding. Each couple must use their agency to make hard choices but as we counsel with the Lord we can be directed to fulfill our individual mission in harmony with His will, whatever our circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Listen To Prophets and Follow</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Savior declared,<em> </em>&ldquo;whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.&rdquo; <sup>21</sup> To this<em>, </em>Elder David A. Bednar added, &ldquo;May we hear and heed the eternal truths taught by the Lord&rsquo;s authorized representatives. As we do so, I promise our faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will be fortified, and we will receive spiritual guidance and protection for our specific circumstances and needs.&rdquo;<sup>22</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Lord promised, &ldquo;Whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trails, their troubles and their afflictions and shall be lifted up at the last day.&rdquo; <sup>23</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The love I have for my wife, Marva, our children and grandchildren, is beyond any words I can express. The joy they are to me is &ldquo;pure joy,&rdquo; and I know that the family is central to the Lord&rsquo;s Plan of Happiness. I testify that God is aware of each of you. He knows the desires of your heart and he will lead you by the hand and give you answers to your prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought about why we have devotional or what it really is? A devotional is typically a short religious service characterized by devotion.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In the Topical Guide, devotion is connected with the words commitment and dedication. These words are then connected to diligence, consecrate, obedience, and steadfastness. I have a great love for words, and I appreciate how tying these words together helps to better describe the concept of devotion and possibly why these gatherings are referred to as devotionals. Devotional is a dedicated time where we exercise our agency to come and show commitment to the Lord. It is not required for your degree; no one will keep track of whether or not you attended. It is strictly your choice to come and receive what you are willing to receive from the spirit. So again, I thank you for choosing to come to devotional.<br /><br />I want to focus today on our ability to choose and have titled my talk after a familiar scriptural phrase, "Choose ye this day."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;This phrase is short but powerful. "Choose ye" indicates that you are the agent of options and "this day" indicates the present nature of time. This is a significant combination. It does not say "choose ye sometime or whenever you feel like it." Nor does it say "let someone else choose for you." The phrase says you are the chooser with the power to do so today.<br /><br />In Doctrine &amp; Covenants 58, we read about the Lord's confidence in our ability to choose for ourselves. Verses 27 and 28 read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>"For the power is in them," this is another great phrase. We do not create an ability to make choices because this power has already been given to us. Not only are we the agents of this power, but the Lord also has confidence in our ability to bring about righteousness through our choices, such as coming to devotional. By choosing to come, we indicate to the Lord we are open to receiving of His Spirit. Our days are filled with choices that effect righteousness. These choices include but are not limited to: will I pray, read my scriptures, speak uplifting words, or observe the honor code? These are our choices to make and when we willingly choose, we are able to receive the blessings of those choices.</p>
<p>I want to share with you a few specific days in which I chose the Lord. On December 4, 1993, I was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On that day, I chose to exercise my agency and made covenants with my Heavenly Father that I am now accountable to follow. On September 16, 2006, I entered the House of the Lord and received my own endowment. On that day, I chose to exercise my agency and made covenants with my Heavenly Father that I am now accountable to follow. And on February 28, 2014, I was sealed to my eternal companion in the Rexburg Idaho Temple. On that day, I chose to exercise my agency and made covenants with my Heavenly Father that I am now accountable to follow. I was not forced to make any of these choices.</p>
<p>In fact, on our wedding day I remember thinking, before going up to the sealing room, "I could say no." That idea quickly left as I thought of all the reasons why I would say yes, but it was my choice. Benjamin was my choice. As our courtship grew closer to marriage, I wanted to receive a powerful confirmation that he was the right choice. Now, don't get me wrong, I had had many promptings and feelings along the way, but I was 27 and had experienced the ups and downs of dating for a while. So I was hoping for a definite confirmation that Ben was who the Lord wanted for me. I fasted and attended the temple. On one particular day, I had determined not to leave the celestial room until I had my moment of confirmation. I did not receive a strong confirmation nor did I receive a stupor of thought or feeling of constraint. My hunger pains eventually got the best of me, and I left feeling a gentle peace. It was not until sometime later during my nightly prayers that the answer came to me, "Brittany, you know enough." With that, I knew the Lord was allowing me to make a choice of my own free will. I made my choice, and I am grateful for it. The Lord was a part of our entire dating process, but He was not going to take the choice away from me.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father is the giver of our agency, and because of this He is also the protector of it. He respects our choices, and He loves us completely. Because of this love, we have already been provided with enough knowledge to make good decisions each day.</p>
<p>As I have contemplated the gift of agency, I have been struck by the message Lehi shares with his son Jacob:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>This is a fundamental scripture about agency, and I have read it many times throughout my life, but studying it this time, I focused on the two choices presented: we are free to choose liberty through the Savior or captivity through the devil. Lehi is not referring to choosing liberty or captivity at the final judgment but in "all things" that "are expedient unto man."</p>
<p>I began to ask myself how different my day-to-day decisions would be if, for every choice I made, I first asked myself, "Is this choice bringing me closer to the Savior?" To be quite honest, my next thought was about how asking that question for every choice seemed a bit extreme. However, I then learned a powerful personal lesson that no longer made it extreme. The very act of asking "Is this choice bringing me closer to the Savior?" naturally makes me think of Him. In so doing, I am fulfilling the covenant I renew during the sacrament to "always remember him."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;If I always remember Him, I am eligible to obtain the blessing to "always have his spirit" to be with me. Consequently, if I always have his Spirit, my choices and decisions will be more in-line with our Father's will and I will be happier.<br /><br />President Henry B. Eyring said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With the companionship of the Holy Ghost, our hearts can change so that we want and welcome the love of our Heavenly Father and of the Lord Jesus Christ. The way to get the love of God into our hearts is simple, as is the way to lose the feeling of that love in our hearts. For instance, someone may choose to pray less often to Heavenly Father or not to pay a full tithing or to stop feasting on the word of God or to ignore the poor and the needy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Any choice not to keep the Lord's commandments can cause the Spirit to withdraw from our hearts. With that loss, happiness diminishes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I encourage you to choose this day a way you can improve in your ability to "always remember him."</p>
<p>Our Savior and our Heavenly Father always remember us, and they love us completely. With that love, they will not take away our agency even when we do not choose them. In Alma 29:5, Alma teaches about the love the Lord has for us and his respect to let us choose, it reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of conscience.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Alma's words fit the pattern taught by Lehi regarding making choices for liberty or captivity, but Alma uses the following words to describe the two choices: life or death, good or evil, joy or remorse of conscience. This scripture is dear to me because my grandma had it hanging in her home, and I used to read it every time I visited. She passed away a few years ago, but I wish I could ask her why this scripture was important enough to her to display in a visible area. Based on what I know of her life and what I have learned from reading her journals, she knew by her own experience and the experiences of loved ones how choices can lead us to captivity or to freedom.</p>
<p>Please remember, while Heavenly Father loves you enough to let you make choices that will lead to captivity, He also loves you enough that He prepared a way through our elder brother, Jesus Christ, to become free.<br /><br />Over the years, I have come to admire the apostle Peter and his devotion to the Savior. Throughout the New Testament, we get to observe many of Peter's choices and his journey to "always remember." In John 6, we see a sudden shift in the people but not in Peter. At the beginning of the chapter, "a great multitude followed [the Savior], because they saw his miracles." The people continue to follow and ask questions and "Jesus... said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent." The Savior then taught that He was the bread of life and had come from heaven to bring salvation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? When Jesus&nbsp;knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?... From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</p>
<p>Please take note in this passage, it says his disciples were those who left him. They saw the very Son of God but chose to be offended and not accept the Savior's proper role. Neither the Savior nor the Church made them leave. We have seen, and will continue to see, this in our day. There are individuals who have a testimony of the gospel but choose to walk away when challenges arise, and it is no longer easy to follow.</p>
<p>I want to return to the story in John Chapter 6, because there is much to learn from Peter:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>What a powerful response! While others are choosing to no longer walk with the Savior, Peter holds to the truth he knows and is not shaken in his determination to follow "Christ, the Son of the living God." Brothers and sisters, it is unlikely that the path of discipleship will ever be popular or carefree. It wasn't for Christ, it wasn't for Joseph Smith, and it won't be for us. All of us here today have experienced some level of mental, spiritual, emotional, or physical pain that may have tested our faith. There are more challenges ahead, but follow Peter's example and hold to what you know.</p>
<p>In this month's first Presidency Message, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During [times of disappointment, doubt, fear, sadness, or stress], it is easy to get caught up in everything that is going wrong and to make our troubles the center of our thoughts. The temptation is to focus on the trials we are facing instead of on the Savior and our testimony of truth....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But the more we focus on our final heavenly destination and on the joys of following the disciple's path&mdash;loving God, serving our neighbor&mdash;the more likely we are to successfully navigate through times of trouble and turbulence.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I appreciate President Uchtdorf's words, and I know they are true. In 2009, I experienced them for myself as I had the opportunity to work at Walt Disney World as part of the Disney College Program. When the opportunity first came up, I thought it sounded fun but did not expect to go. However, I was surprised at how direct of a prompting I received about accepting a position. I traveled down to Orlando, Florida, on my own and was assigned to work as a Jungle Cruise Skipper. For those of you who do not know what a Jungle Cruise Skipper is&mdash;I wore safari attire, drove boats, and told cheesy jokes. It was awesome!</p>
<p>Actually, it was not quite so awesome at the beginning. My name tag said Brigham Young University-Idaho, and the first few days at the Jungle Cruise, many of my coworkers asked if I was Mormon. I had no problems confirming the question, but it seemed that many of them were uncomfortable and didn't want to talk to me afterwards. One moment in particular, I walked into the break room in time to hear a girl say, "I don't want to hear about their golden bible." With that, the room went silent, and people avoided eye contact with me. Needless to say, things were a little rocky.<br /><br />A few days later, I was scheduled to work all day on a Sunday. It was a long, discouraging day, and at the end of my shift, I sat alone at the bus stop waiting to get home. I was confused as to why I had felt so strongly that I needed to come when it seemed like I would be missing church often and I felt like no one wanted me around because of my religion. What was I doing here? In my moment of despair, I felt a flood of courage come into my heart, and I thought to myself, "This will not break you." I made a choice that I would do all that I could to feed my spirit each day. I would study my scriptures more intently, attend all the meetings I could, and be an active participant in my ward even though I would only be there for a few months. I also decided that regardless of how my coworkers treated me, I would choose to love them and pray for the gift of charity every day.<br /><br />I did have to work on most Sundays, but I was blessed with late-night shifts that allowed me to attend all of my church meetings, for which I am grateful. I look back on that summer with great fondness. I saw the hand of the Lord in my life, and I made wonderful friends at work. Even though our beliefs and our choices differed, we had fun being together and I knew how much the Lord loved them. I hope they felt that love through my love for them.<br /><br />I was also blessed to make wonderful friends from my ward with whom I shared many adventures. That summer was a spiritually enriching and fun experience for me. I am still grateful for the opportunity, mostly because I learned so much about how my personal choices for righteousness helped me overcome challenges and increase in happiness.<br /><br />I continue to learn about the power of my choices, and as part of my work here with employment in Human Resources, I have the opportunity to learn about the personal choices applicants have made. Most of the choices are good and have benefited their lives; other times, information is disclosed about poor choices that they now regret. These choices continue to affect their lives because that is the reality of consequences whether they are good or bad.<br /><br />I enjoy my work and I find it a rewarding experience to be a part of the hiring process. However, with each job offer there are many more individuals who will not be hired. It is difficult to contact these candidates because they often are disappointed. At these challenging times, I learn even more about candidates based on how they choose to respond. Some have chosen to respond in anger and blame, while others have chosen to respond with gratitude and kindness. I am sure you can guess which response can hinder and which can improve future opportunities.<br /><br />There are many employees on campus who were not hired for the first position for which they applied. Over a period of several years, one employee was declined 42 times before the right position, at the right time, was offered. Although it was discouraging, he chose to keep preparing and continued to follow the Spirit.<br /><br />Just over a year ago, I contacted two interview candidates right before Christmas to inform them that they were not selected. These were impressive candidates, and the hiring decision had been difficult to make. Even with the length of time it took to make the decision and the upcoming holiday, these two were very gracious, albeit disappointed. They were remembered for future opportunities, and I am happy to report that they both are employed at BYU-Idaho now. Even seemingly small choices today can affect future opportunities.<br /><br />I want to share with you one more personal experience about exercising agency. During my second semester of college at Idaho State University, I attended a stake conference where the speaker told us to make a plan that week. If the plan changed along the way, it was all right but we needed to start moving forward. I was a bit skeptical, but I chose to put it to the test. So even though I had no idea what I wanted to major in, I determined I would work towards an associate's degree. That way I would have a clean break in school to serve a mission when I turned 21, and if that was not right, I trusted that by the end of the associate's degree the Lord would provide me with more knowledge. Since I was interested in learning another language and about other cultures, I decided to get my Associate's degree in Spanish.</p>
<p>Now I will share with you a great secret&mdash;I don't speak Spanish. I went on an English-speaking mission and I still have yet to get more involved with Spanish. After my mission, I transferred to BYU-Idaho, studied communication, and now I work in Human Resources. Some of you may be tempted to think my plan was wrong or even a waste of time, but I have seen many blessings come from that decision. There may still be more to learn about it but maybe not. Either way, I know the Lord upholds our plans and efforts as we exercise our agency for righteousness.</p>
<p>So my dear friends, choose ye this day, for the power is in you. It is in you. You can choose to pray, you can choose to read your scriptures, you can choose to follow the honor code, you can choose to attend devotional, and you can choose to do many good things of your own free will. In so doing, you will have the Spirit to be with you and you will experience the same blessings King Benjamin shares with his people, when he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>General Authority Seventy</p>
<p>Elder Randall K. Bennett was sustained as a General Authority Seventy of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 2, 2011. &nbsp;He served for four years in the Europe East Area Presidency in Moscow, Russia, and for three years previous to that as mission president of the Russia Samara Mission. He is currently serving as an Assistant Executive Director in the Priesthood and Family Department and assists in supervising the North America Northeast Area.<br /><br /> Elder Bennett received a Doctor of Dental Surgery from the University of Alberta as well as a Master of Science degree in Orthodontics from Loma Linda University in California.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Bennett served as a full-time missionary in the France Paris and France Toulouse Missions. He has served in various ward and stake callings as well as branch president at the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah.</p>
<p>Randall Kay Bennett was born in Magrath, Alberta, Canada on June 17, 1955.&nbsp; He married Shelley Dianne Watchman in 1977 in the Cardston Alberta Temple.&nbsp; They are the parents of four children.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>ELDER BENNETT: My dear brothers and sisters, my wife Shelley and I are deeply grateful and blessed to be with you today. We feel of your incredible spirits!<br /><br />We really wish we could sit down with each of you personally and visit together. Knowing that wasn't possible, as we prayerfully prepared, we felt prompted to have you ask yourselves three eternally significant questions:<br /><br />1. Who am I? We don't mean, who does the world say you are or should be, but who are you really and who were you before you were born?<br /><br />2. What are my greatest desires? By that, we don't mean your desires about classes, school or even dating, but what were your greatest desires before you ever came to earth and what are they now?<br /><br />3. What are my highest priorities? We don't mean your priorities about your chosen profession or career, but what were your highest priorities during your premortal life and what are they now?<br /><br />Let's start with your identity&mdash;who you really are. I testify that each of you is a beloved spirit daughter or son of heavenly parents. You are the very "offspring" of your Heavenly Father.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Each of you has a divine nature, identity, and destiny.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Before being born on this earth, you grew and progressed and you learned to love eternal truth.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;You rejoiced in your Heavenly Father's plan, by which you could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately become like Him.<sup>4</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Because of your faithfulness during your premortal life, you were specifically reserved for this time on earth. Here, you can continue to grow as you make correct decisions and learn from and repent of incorrect decisions. The eternal truths you loved and learned in your premortal life will help you overcome or endure any challenges you experience here.<br /><br />We invite you to think often about and remember your divine nature, identity, and destiny. We invite you to study your patriarchal blessing. We promise you that understanding who you really are will be a key to having righteous desires and priorities, which make possible your return to your heavenly home.<br /><br />Perhaps we can illustrate this best with some of our own experiences. I would like to invite my wife and beloved eternal companion Shelley to join me.<br /><br />SISTER BENNETT: Please understand that my husband and I did not come from perfect families or ideal backgrounds. My mother was baptized three months after I was born, but my father never joined the Church. My father died when I was 17, and my beloved oldest brother died four years later. My husband's parents divorced when he was a young man. We both have siblings who are not active in the Church today.<br /><br />Our own circumstances, and the false philosophies, values, and teachings of the world, can distract and blur our vision of who we really are. When we were your age, we tried to stay focused on who we really were. We decided not to be limited by our circumstances. We also established new traditions and patterns of gospel living for ourselves and our eternal family.<br /><br />ELDER BENNETT: Regarding the second question, "What are my greatest desires?"<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;I testify that among your greatest desires during your premortal life were returning to live with your Heavenly Father, being exalted, and becoming like Him. We invite you to make these your greatest desires now. We promise you that if you recognize and act according to your true, divine, and eternal self, you will be taking an essential step in returning to and becoming like your Heavenly Father.<br /><br />SISTER BENNETT: When I was your age, I knew I was a beloved daughter of God, and my desires came from wanting to be true to that identity. I was attracted to my future husband because I could see that he was clearly guided by his identity as a son of God.<br /><br />Yes, we each have difficult circumstances and challenges, but we are not our circumstances&mdash;or our challenges.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;We are beloved sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father.<br /><br />After my father passed away, I decided I wanted to serve a mission and become a nurse. I was preparing to serve a mission while enrolled in nursing school and decided one evening to attend an institute "ice cream social." While there, I noticed a seemingly shy returned missionary who had been home for only 24 hours. I felt compassion for him, filled a bowl with ice cream, approached him, and said, "Hi, I'm Shelley. Would you like some ice cream?"<br /><br />ELDER BENNETT: When Shelley offered me that bowl of ice cream, I immediately fell in love&mdash;with the ice cream! I was, however, curious about this wonderfully confident, assertive, courageous, and beautiful young woman. Over the course of a few months, we became friends; in fact, we became best friends. I learned that Shelley knew who she really was, and her greatest desire was to return to live with her Heavenly Father.<br /><br />As I studied the scriptures, pondered, and prayed, I realized that my best friend would make the very best eternal companion for me. After fasting, I knew that God approved of our being together forever. So I summoned the courage and asked Shelley to marry me. She smiled and then said, "NO&mdash;I promised God I would serve a mission."<br /><br />I was crushed! How could I negotiate with that answer? Disappointed but not discouraged, I continued studying, praying, and fasting. Several weeks later, I again asked for her hand in marriage. This time she looked very touched, smiled, and after a long pause said, no&mdash;again. But I knew what I felt from the Spirit, and so after a few more weeks, I asked again. This time her answer was absolutely not!<br /><br />SISTER BENNETT: Now, at no time was he overbearing or claiming to have received revelation for me. He was simply an undaunted returned missionary, and he knew I had to receive my own answer. So he actually did ask a fourth time, but this time he shared a general conference talk with me.<br /><br />I smile today as I remember him showing me that talk, with the appropriate paragraph well highlighted! The message to me was that a young woman could choose to marry in the temple without feeling guilty about not serving a mission.<br /><br />He also received a prompting I know was from the Holy Ghost and he followed it. He promised that if I would marry him, we would serve missions together after raising our family. With that promise, I said, "I'll think about it!"<br /><br />As I read my scriptures and that talk, pondered, prayed, and fasted, I felt a sweet calm about accepting his proposal. I still had fears as our futures were very uncertain. I wasn't finished with university, and he had no education. He also had no job, no car, no home, and no money, and my mother thought he had no future! But faith ultimately overcame fear, and several days after his fourth proposal, I said yes.<br /><br />I still felt determined to serve a mission, but marrying in the temple was a better decision&mdash;the best decision for me&mdash;and I trusted that we would eventually serve missions together. He has, by the way, kept that promise!<br /><br />ELDER BENNETT: This, of course, is our story. Your stories will be different, but as you always remember who you truly are and follow the Spirit, you will be guided along a path tailored precisely for you.<br /><br />Question 3: What are my highest priorities? Among your highest priorities before coming to earth were obeying your Heavenly Father, following Jesus Christ, and keeping His commandments.&nbsp;But you knew you would not always obey all His commandments and you would make mistakes. You knew your sins could forever separate you from God.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;However, you rejoiced when His Firstborn, Jehovah, volunteered to become your Savior and atone for your sins.<br /><br />You shouted for joy<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;knowing that, because of Jesus Christ and the blessings of His Atonement, you could repent, progress and eventually qualify for exaltation.<br /><br />You knew that your greatest desires would be possible if you made obeying your Heavenly Father and following Jesus Christ your highest priorities.<br /><br />Let's consider the life of the Savior and the pattern and path He invited us to follow.<br /><br />Jesus Christ loved and trusted His Father in Heaven and had perfect faith in Him.<br /><br />His faith in His Father gave Him strength and power to submit fully to His Father's will and live a perfectly obedient life.<br /><br />To fully obey and show us the way, Jesus was baptized.<br /><br />And the Holy Ghost descended upon Him.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The Savior then perfectly persevered until the end of His earthly life. His life shows us the pattern, the covenant path that we must follow.<sup>10</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>This gospel path can be likened to a spiritual stairway leading forward and upward into more and more light. The steps on the stairway represent the first principles and ordinances of the gospel.<sup>11</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>To follow the Savior and come unto Him, we also need to exercise faith in our Heavenly Father and in Jesus Christ and His Atonement.<br /><br />Our faith leads us to obey His commandments and to repent when we disobey. Repentance is a joyful process. As we become more spiritually minded and pay less heed to temptation, our hearts and minds are changed and we become more Christlike.<br /><br />Repentance first leads to baptism and then to other ordinances and covenants.<br /><br />Renewing our baptismal covenant each week through the ordinance of the sacrament makes it possible for us to have the constant companionship of the Holy Spirit. If we have prepared for this ordinance with broken hearts and contrite spirits, because of and through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost-as a purifier and sanctifier-can cleanse us and make possible a remission of our sins.<br /><br />It is also the Holy Ghost who endows us with a greater measure of faith each time we repeat this process.<sup>12</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles recently gave an address here, entitled "Repeat Over Again... the Same&nbsp;Things as Before." He taught that "repetition is a vehicle through which the Holy Ghost can enlighten our minds, influence our hearts, and enlarge our understanding."<sup>13</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>As we repeat the Savior's pattern of living, the Holy Ghost will help us draw closer and closer to God. Continuously repeating these steps is what we describe as "enduring to the end."<sup>14</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>We climb the stairway by repeatedly exercising and acting in faith through patterns such as daily prayer and scripture study. We also continue repenting and keeping our covenants. These steps invite the Spirit, through whom we are endowed with even more faith and other spiritual gifts. Greater faith gives us the strength to continue to willingly obey and keep our covenants. Obediently keeping covenants invites the Spirit and gifts of even greater faith. As we repeat these steps, we spiritually draw closer to God.<br /><br />Elder Jeffrey R. Holland recently reminded us that we are led back to our Heavenly "Father through the ministry, Atonement, and grace of His Son, with the influence of the Holy Ghost guiding" us home.<sup>15</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>We must be born again and fundamentally changed to inherit the kingdom of God. Accepting and living these first principles and ordinances of the gospel is the process by which we are truly converted. It is during this process that our hearts are changed.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;By living this, the doctrine of Christ, repeatedly pressing forward and upward, we are spiritually born again.<sup>17</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>With each small step upward, we will encounter challenges and adversity. Remembering our true identity and our greatest desires and priorities helps us to rely more fully on Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Following Him will allow challenges and adversity to help us rather than hurt us. With this help, we grow as we endure and take each crucial step along His path.<br /><br />SISTER BENNETT: If, however, we choose to follow the philosophies, teachings, or values of the world, we will fall and descend. If we don't stop our descent by taking small faith-filled steps upward again, we will descend into more and more darkness and misery, separating ourselves from God's influence.<br /><br />Remember that Lucifer has power to influence us only if we give it to him.<sup>18</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Your agency is one of Heavenly Father's greatest gifts to you.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;This is your journey. You decide when to move, how to move, and in which direction to move.<br /><br />As we exercise faith and follow the Savior's path, our desires and priorities quietly change.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;As we willingly stay on His gospel path, we are increasingly filled with light, peace, and joy.<sup>21</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>ELDER BENNETT: As we relate this next experience, watch how following God's prophets, helped us establish priorities that would bless our lives forever.<br /><br />After my best friend finally agreed to marry me, we bought an inexpensive engagement ring. But I felt unsettled&mdash;not about marrying but about what we had learned at a recent general conference. Several of the talks had reinforced the principles of self-reliance and preparedness. To obey the prophetic counsel, we needed to start acquiring a supply of food for emergencies. But we were both students&mdash;with very little money.<br /><br />One day shortly after we got engaged, I felt prompted to sell the ring.... What? How was I supposed to ask Shelley to do that? I had&nbsp;<em>just</em>convinced her to accept the ring. How would she feel about selling her ring to buy dried milk, wheat, and salt?<br /><br />SISTER BENNETT: He didn't know it, but I had also felt impressed to sell the ring. What would he think if I suggested it? I'd already said no three times, followed by an "I'll think about it!"<br /><br />But the prompting was unmistakable, so I brought it up a few days later. We were both surprised and relieved that we had felt the same impression. Miraculously, the jeweler's heart was softened, and he gave us a full refund for the ring. We then used the money to purchase our food storage.<br /><br />To replace my ring, he made me a leather band that I wore for some time. It became a symbol of our decision to always follow the prophet and the promptings of the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />Now, my dear sisters, you don't need to leave here and sell your rings! Buying or wearing a ring isn't wrong. For us, however, because the Spirit had directed us to follow the prophet by selling my engagement ring, our choice was between keeping a ring or following the prophet. Making this decision helped us establish two patterns in our home from the very beginning: following the prophets and following the promptings of the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />We learned to follow the apostles and prophets and not to worry about what others might think. By acting immediately and cheerfully on their invitations and counsel, we have always been blessed. Shortly after graduating from dental school and with two children, we ran completely out of money. Gratefully, we were able to live on the food storage we had purchased.<br /><br />ELDER BENNETT: Because our goals shape our priorities, and our priorities determine our actions, and what we become, we must change our goals if they are not leading us to eternal life and to what we want to become. When I was 12, I had a goal to be a dentist in Hollywood. Twenty years later, Shelley and I were living in Hollywood, with an orthodontic office in Beverly Hills, California. Goal accomplished, right?<br /><br />Well, we realized that our greatest desires, eternal life and exaltation, and our highest priorities&mdash;obeying our Heavenly Father and following Jesus Christ and His prophets&mdash;were at risk because of worldly values and all the material distractions that the world claimed would make us happy and fulfilled.<br /><br />We realized that our greatest desires and highest priorities in eternity must also be our greatest desires and highest priorities now.Thus, Heavenly Father's plan for&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;family required us to move. We prayed for and were eventually blessed with another opportunity that was more ideal for our family.<br /><br />SISTER BENNETT: Brothers and sisters, don't let any desire, plan, priority, or goal&mdash;even if it is an interesting academic or professional one&mdash;get in the way of your exaltation and eternal life.<br /><br />Make righteous plans and then be willing to adjust them, knowing that Heavenly Father has the best plan for you. We invite you to follow the promptings of the Spirit and faithfully work as you wait upon the Lord, pressing forward in faith as His plan for you is revealed. We promise you that great joy will be found on your journey if you act in faith and patiently trust Him.<br /><br />I love you, my dear brothers and sisters. You are incredible, and you are a great example to us of valiant, faithful sons and daughters of God. I bear my testimony that Heavenly Father lives, that Jesus Christ is our Savior, and that President Thomas S. Monson is the Lord's prophet. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />ELDER BENNETT: I promise you that living Apostles of the Lord, Jesus Christ are on the earth today. I promise that they are doing exactly what the Savior is directing them to do.<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;I promise you that you can trust the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, no matter what the world, the Internet, or social media say.<br /><br />I bear my witness that you have a Heavenly Father, and He loves you and is aware of you. I bear my witness that Jesus Christ lives. He is our Savior, our Redeemer, and our great Exemplar. I bear my witness that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith and that, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the gospel was restored to the earth. I promise you that God speaks today through His living prophet, President Thomas S. Monson. These absolute truths I know and testify of, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mathematics Faculty Member</p>
<p>Elaine Rumsey Wagner graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in mathematics and a minor in logic. She received a master's degree in mathematics with distinction from California State University in Fresno and taught in the California Community College System. She received her Doctorate of Education from the University of Idaho, doing her dissertation research on the first-semester calculus students at BYU-Idaho. She had been teaching at Brigham Young University Idaho for six years. She and her husband, Thomas Wagner, have been married for 25 joyful years. They are the parents of four sons and one daughter. She spends her time juggling work and family, attending cultural and sporting events featuring Wagner children, serving in her ward, jogging, and balancing boards on water, in both solid and liquid form. The hardest and best thing she has ever done is having and raising her children.<br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /><br />I am grateful for this opportunity to speak with you and for the opportunity to be a small part of this great university. I am thankful for my family, friends, and students who came to support me. I appreciate the beautiful music that uplifts us each week at the devotionals.&nbsp;To begin I should say that I am typically not a dreamer of profound dreams. When I dream I most frequently dream about attainable, mundane things. I have had dreams about folding socks, washing dishes, and changing baby diapers at a party. I once had a slightly more exciting dream of visiting a paper recycling plant. But one dream has changed me, even though it is not even slightly as profound as Lehi's dream.<br /><br />A few years ago I was momentarily between primary callings having just finished my time as primary chorister. I must add that I am not a singer, but I do love the songs. I got a phone call asking me to substitute teach in a primary class. I agreed and volunteered my daughter, Morgan, to teach with me.<br /><br />The lesson was about the ten lepers. I love this story in the New Testament. The opportunity to talk about gratitude both for others and for the Lord excited me. Jesus's life was so short&mdash;only 33 years&mdash;and his ministry was even shorter&mdash;just three years. Luke recorded and preserved a few precious stories and teachings. I believe that this event with the ten lepers is included in Luke's record not just because gratitude is nice, but because developing a spirit of gratitude is vital to our salvation. Christ's teachings are focused on what we must do to truly become whole.<br /><br />In the Doctrine and Covenants 78:19 we are taught "... he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more."<br /><br />President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said, "How blessed we are if we recognize God's handiwork in the marvelous tapestry of life. Gratitude to our Father in Heaven broadens our perception and clears our vision. It inspires humility and fosters empathy toward our fellowmen and all of God's creation. Gratitude is a catalyst to all Christlike attributes! A thankful heart is the parent of all virtues."<sup>1</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>I knew all of the children in this Primary class from singing time. And although they were an older class they would always gleefully ask to sing action songs like "Once There Was a Snowman"<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;or "Do As I'm Doing."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;My daughter and I settled on an active plan to teach the lesson where we would first convey the idea of leprosy. I have changed the children's names to protect the innocent and the wiggly.<br /><br />After the opening prayer we talked with the children about what it is like to be sick. Sarah said, "My mom sits by me and reads me stories." Sam said, "When I was in the hospital my dad gave me a blessing and I felt better."<br /><br />"We are going to pretend to be in the time when Jesus lived on earth," I told them. "I would like you to think about what it would be like to be sick with a disease called leprosy. Would anyone like to volunteer to help me?" Every hand shot into the air. Nathan stepped forward when I called his name.<br /><br />"Nathan, I am so sorry you have leprosy," I said. "It has affected the whole left side of your face. You need bandages."<br /><br />Morgan wrapped half of Nathan's head in clean toilet paper blocking his vision and covering one ear while the rest of the class giggled. Nathan turned and grinned at them then tried to return to his chair. I stopped him and said, "Oh Nathan, you can't sit by the other kids anymore. They are still clean. Lepers are dirty and will make everyone sick." I moved him to the corner and had him sit on the floor.<br /><br />One by one the children had parts of their bodies bandaged and sat in the corner of the primary room on the floor.Sam asked, "Can I get a drink?"<br /><br />"No," I answered, "lepers can't use the drinking fountain. That is for healthy people. You are unclean."<br /><br />Rachel raised her bandaged hand and asked, "Who took care of the lepers?"<br /><br />"No one took care of them but the other lepers," I explained. "The lepers were taken from their families. Their moms and dads didn't sit by their beds to help them. All of their friends abandoned them. People would run away if they saw a leper coming towards them." Morgan continued, "Lepers had to ring a bell if they were coming close to people and call out 'Leper! Outcast! Unclean!' to warn everyone they were near."</p>
<p>"How would you feel if you were a leper?" I asked. The children were quiet and thoughtful for a few minutes then responded:</p>
<p>"I would miss my mom and my dad."<br />"I would feel sad."<br />"Couldn't they ever go back to their families?"<br />"No," I answered, "not unless they were cured."<br />"Were very many cured?" Joseph asked.<br /><br />"No, not then. Today there is medicine that helps when people are sick, but the lepers in Jesus's time didn't have any hope," I responded. The tissue bandages slipped down around necks, wrists, and legs. Some of the children leaned against one another. A few pulled their knees to their chests and put their heads down.<br /><br />"I would want my mom," Rachel said.<br />"I would too," Morgan answered softly.&nbsp;"Now, imagine that you have heard some exciting news," I told them. "There is a man who heals people. He healed someone who was blind. He healed someone who couldn't walk. This man is coming near where you live with the other lepers. Maybe he can heal you. What do you think this man's name is?"<br /><br />"Jesus!" cried the children.<br />"I would go to him and ask him to help me," said Nathan.<br /><br />I explained that is just what the lepers in Jesus's time did. Their whole world was filled with hope again. Maybe they would get to be with their families again. They went to Jesus and begged him to heal them. And Jesus did heal them. Morgan and I removed all the tissue bandages and the children returned to their seats.<br /><br />"How do you think the lepers that were healed felt now?" I asked. The children cheered and even danced around a little.<br /><br />"I would run to find my dad!" Sam said.<br />"Oh thank you, thank you, thank you!" Sarah said.<br /><br />"I'm so glad you remembered to say thank you," I said. "Do you know only one leper said thank you to Jesus?"<br />Sarah looked surprised, "But he had given them their whole life back."<br /><br />We finished the lesson by reading the scriptures in Luke, talking about gratitude, and making thank you cards. Morgan and I got hugs and lots of "thank yous" as they left.<br /><br />I came home from church tired but proud that the lesson had gone so well with the children. I felt like I had set a good example of teaching primary for my daughter. I settled down for my well-deserved Sunday nap.<br /><br />My dream began with the primary lesson I had just taught. But as the children left the classroom instead of pride at a well-taught lesson I felt an aching sadness. In my dream I could feel the Savior's rebuke that I had missed the most important part of the lesson of the lepers. I could see myself diseased, bruised, and hurting but I looked normal on the outside. No one that looked at me could see the wounds that I carried. I could see that the others around me had unnoticeable secret wounds as well. I yearned to be healed and to be clean. I wanted to be with my family but knew I could not find them. I was utterly hopeless.<br /><br />I startled awake with cold regret washing over me. I would not teach these children again next week. The primary class was not mine, I was just a substitute. I would not get to tell them that the story of the ten lepers was not just about gratitude and thank you notes, it was about the Atonement; that each of us walks around in life with wounds, and sores, and missing parts. For some of us the wounds are visible, but for most of us the wounds are not on our physical bodies. Our spirits are wounded and bruised, sometimes from our own actions and choices. Sometimes our bruises come from the actions and choices of others. Like the lepers there is no hope for us, there is no medicine or procedure to cure us, even with all the fabulous modern methods that we have now, there is no hope for us to be with our families again except through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. "For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made."<sup>4</sup><sup><br /></sup></p>
<p>Of course this dream has prompted me to ponder the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to think more about the scripture account of the lepers found in Luke 17. All ten lepers were healed. They were physically cured of the disease of leprosy, but only to the Samaritan leper who returned to give thanks did Jesus say, "thy faith hath made the whole."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;I do not believe that the other nine men were "un-healed" or afflicted with leprosy again. So there must be a difference between being healed and being made whole. In the Guide to the Scriptures we learn that "to be whole" is synonymous with "to be complete or fully developed" or in other words to be made perfect through Christ's grace and Atonement.<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>In addition to developing a spirit of gratitude, what do we need to become whole? Jesus told the Samaritan leper that his faith had made him whole. Consider also the story of the woman plagued with an issue of blood. After touching the hem of Jesus's clothes she was healed and Jesus turned to her saying, "Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;This is the kind of faith in Jesus that He can and He will deliver us. This is faith in Christ as our Savior&mdash;He who saves us from the consequences of the fall, and as our Redeemer&mdash;He who pays the consequences of our sins and fulfills justice. It is deeper than faith in general&mdash;like the faith that if we study hard we can do well on our exams, or even the faith that Jesus is our benevolent big brother who wishes us well. It is different than the faith in Christ as the Lord of Hosts that will fight our battles.</p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales explained, "Only faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement can bring us peace, hope, and understanding. Only faith that He suffered for our sakes will give us the strength to endure to the end. When we gain this faith, we experience a mighty change of heart."<sup>8</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Alma emphasized this faith when he asked, "Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?"<sup>9</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>How does such faith in the roles of Jesus as Savior and Redeemer affect us? On lds.org it says, "Having faith in Jesus Christ means relying completely on Him&mdash;trusting in His infinite power, intelligence, and love. It includes believing His teachings. It means believing that even though we do not understand all things, He does."<sup>10</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>This is the faith that motivates and guides our actions and our choices. This is the faith that makes us turn to the Lord and ask for healing. This faith leads us to repentance and gives us the motivation to make daily consistent righteous choices. Armed with faith we speak kindly to our grouchy roommate. We accept callings, even though we are uncertain about our abilities, like nursery leader, gospel doctrine teacher, or bishop. We come to church even though it is easier to stay home with the cranky toddler. As we cultivate this faith we are led to make and keep sacred covenants to bind ourselves to the Savior and Redeemer. To become whole we need a spirit of gratitude and faith in our Redeemer, and like the ten lepers, we must plead with the Lord for healing and for strength.<br /><br />In Alma 37:37 we read, "Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day."<br /><br />Consider the story of Enos. I think he was a lot like you and me. We have been taught the gospel and he too had been taught "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." One day as he thought about eternity and life and joy, his soul hungered and he cried out in "mighty prayer and supplication." Like the Samaritan leper and the woman with the issue of blood, Enos was told that his faith in Christ had made him whole.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;He then began to pray for others, starting with his people, the Nephites. He prayed that if all else failed their records would be preserved. He then prayed that the Lamanites would not be destroyed. Why did he do that? Didn't he know that the Lord had already promised several prophets that he would preserve the Nephite records and the Lamanite people? Perhaps not because the Lord does tell him. In verse 18 we read, "And the Lord said unto me: Thy fathers have also required of me this thing; and it shall be done unto them according to their faith; for their faith was like unto thine."<br /><br />I wondered how Enos would have prayed for the exact thing that prophets had prayed for, for the things that the Lord had already promised. As we pray in faith and gratitude our desires change from our will to what the Lord desires.<br /><br />In the Bible dictionary it states, "Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant but that are made conditional on our asking for them. Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings.... We pray in Christ's name when our mind is the mind of Christ, and our wishes the wishes of Christ&mdash;when His words abide in us (John 15:7). We then ask for things it is possible for God to grant. Many prayers remain unanswered because they are not in Christ's name at all; they in no way represent His mind but spring out of the selfishness of man's heart."<br /><br />As we live in "Thanksgiving daily,"<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;act in faith, and pray sincerely in Christ's name, we then can become what the Lord wants us to become&mdash;and what the Lord sees for us is always better than what we can see for ourselves.<br /><br />Let's think about our beginnings. We are each born into a family and we grow and learn. Our childhood and teen years are a time where we focus on ourselves&mdash;necessarily so&mdash;as we learn to eat, drink, walk, talk, and love. We learn math and reading, winning, and losing. We learn the stories of Jesus and the Primary answers. We learn to get along with others even when they are annoying. We learn to drive, and to work, and to study, and more, all while being supported and encouraged by our parents who we rarely thank for changing our diapers.<br /><br />Then comes a time for a change in our focus. If we willfully choose to stay in the self-focused stage of life, we become selfish. Our progression is stopped no matter how many things we can check off our personal "bucket list." We are like the rich ruler that approached Christ. He had kept the commandments. He wanted eternal life, but when Jesus told him to give his possessions to the poor and follow Him, the ruler turned away sorrowfully.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;We too find only sorrow as we turn from our Lord to our selfish desires.</p>
<p>The Savior is the Master Teacher. He teaches with history, words, and parables. He teaches by example, providing a perfect example to follow. And He provides experiences in our lives that lead us to Him and help us come to know Him better, promising each of us that, "All things shall work together for your good."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;It is essential that we come to know Him because He is the only way we can be made whole.<br /><br />May I share a little about how I recently realized that I have been taught by the Savior. For some the change from self-focus begins during a mission, where the hard work of being a disciple is practiced. For me it began at college. But first a little background, I grew up in a family with three girls. We had no close neighbors, especially no boy neighbors. By the time I was in college I realized that talking to men, especially young unmarried men, especially cute, young unmarried men, about non-academic subjects made me nervous, which definitely does not help on lonely Friday nights. I knew I needed to improve my communication skills so I decided to practice. I began to practice by talking to one cute young unmarried man who occasionally came to visit in my apartment. His name was Tom. While I did begin by helping with his math homework, I also worked on talking about non-academic subjects. Practice seemed to be going well, even though once I said "hi" on campus and he totally ignored me. He started showing up in my Physical Science class and his apartment visits became more frequent. Soon we moved to dating, but I had goals and plans and I was just practicing after all. I remained oblivious.<br /><br />You know that sometimes promptings from the Holy Ghost come as a quiet whisper, or a burning in your heart. One day as I was walking up to campus I received a prompting in a very different way, more like a slushy snowball to the back of the head and the strong, loud words in my mind, "If the Lord wants you to marry Tom Wagner you had better get ready to marry Tom Wagner." Later, thankfully, more gentle confirmations from the Spirit followed.<br /><br />As I willingly chose to marry Tom, I literally took upon myself a new name, his name. I was identified as his, just as he was identified as mine. My focus changed from a self-focus to an us-focus. Not perfectly of course, but we were united and what seemed important to me had changed. Many experiences followed leading us to paths and vistas we never would have or could have had alone. We had the excruciating and wonderful experience of giving birth to five children, watching them grow, learn, and struggle. As parents, as adults we look around us and say in effect, "Bucket list-Smucket list. For these that I love&mdash;my family&mdash;I would give my all. I will give every effort every day. I would give my life for these." And we realize it is the hardest, but best thing in the world.<br /><br />As I looked back at this experience, the spirit taught me that in my life it is a type of uniting in purpose with Christ. To unite in purpose with Christ we sometimes fear to give up self, our selfish goals, or our bucket list. But as we take upon us His name willingly we become part of something new. It is not always easy, but it is always better than what we saw for ourselves. Like King Lamoni's father we can choose to give up our sins,<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;like pettiness, pride, and jealously. We can choose to bury our weapons of war and submit our will to the will of the Lord. It is the only way.<br /><br />However, just because we have a spirit of gratitude, faith in the Savior, and pray sincerely does not mean we will not have trials and hard times. We learn and grow from the experiences we have here in mortality. I grew up with wonderful parents that exemplified the gospel. My mother taught Spanish and my father was a civil engineer. My father was big and strong. When I was young I loved to have him throw me up in the air then catch me laughing. He carried me on his shoulders and showed me the world. Later he carried his grandchildren the same way.<br /><br />When I was about six I realized that he was one of the kindest people in the world. One day as we stood in line for an ice cream cone he left me with my sister and walked past the angry customers to the front of the line. He quietly told the frustrated clerk that he would pay the difference between the handful of pennies a messy little boy had spread on the counter and the food the boy had ordered. It was a small thing really, maybe a few dollars, but it made a huge impact on me. I first began to understand the love of the Savior because of the love my father showed.<br /><br />About a month ago my father died. We had 12 hours from the time that the Life Flight helicopter landed at the hospital for my family to gather. Machines surrounded his bed in the critical care unit. They buzzed and cried out while they traced the electronic patterns of his failing body. At the end, I stood at his bedside with my mother and my sisters, my husband and my children, and we wept. At that moment everything else fell away&mdash;all concern with pretense, or positions, or possessions did not matter. The only things that remained important were the covenants that held my family together and the Savior's victory over death.<br /><br />The next Friday, after work, I walked along the snow-packed streets of Rexburg. I would like to thank the many BYU-Idaho students who stopped to offer me a ride. I'm sure I looked cold walking in the snow and slush, but despite the skirt I was wearing I just felt the need to walk and think. No one could see the invisible hurt and sorrow I was carrying. When I looked up through the swirling flakes I could see the temple, creamy white in the snow. But instead of peace, questions machine-gunned into my mind, not because I doubt, but because I hurt. Where was my father? Is the gospel real? Can these covenants really keep us safe? How will I help my mother? Where is hope? Will this winter ever end? By the time I got home I was numb, even more in my heart than in my toes. I talked, walked, made dinner, and slept numb.<br /><br />In the morning the sun rose. Outside, as I ran past the snowfields, answers came. Past the despair and pain that seemed to hang in the air, I could breathe in the hope given through the Atonement. Through the Savior's sacrifice my heart could beat, my lungs could fill, and blood could circulate without collapsing under the weight of forever losing someone I loved, because of the Atonement; because of the covenants my father and mother made and spent their lives keeping; because of the covenants I have made and am striving to keep, we can be united as a family again. The Savior and Redeemer knows perfectly how to succor us.<br /><br />Alma taught that Jesus Christ "...shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people. And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities...the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance"<sup>16</sup><sup><br /></sup><br />Like the lepers in Jesus's time, there is only one way, there is only one hope for me, and for you, to be healed, to be made clean, and to be made whole. It is through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. We must remember Him and we must remember the price He paid through His unfathomable suffering. We must turn to Him and plead for His help having faith that He will deliver us. We must show our gratitude and love by obeying His laws and making and keeping sacred covenants. There is no other choice that matters and no other way. Nephi told us the Lord "...loveth those who will have him to be their god."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;We must choose Him.<br /><br />As we turn to the Lord it is vital that we remember His sacrifice for us. When I was younger I shied away from thinking about Christ's suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, the cruelty of His trial, and the agony He suffered on the cross. It seemed gruesome and so sad. Yet the resurrected Lord called direct attention to the nail prints in His hands and feet and the piercing in His side that He still bares. He invited his disciple Thomas and the thousands of Nephites to "thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet." And why did He do this? "That ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;He revealed to Joseph Smith the suffering that he endured so that we would not have to suffer the price of justice for our sins.<br /><br />"For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I; Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit&mdash;and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink."<sup>19</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>We sing with our primary children, "It shouldn't be hard to sit very still and think about Jesus, his cross on the hill, and all that he suffered and did for me; it shouldn't be hard to sit quietly."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;We, and even small children, must remember and ponder Christ's suffering because even a partial understanding of the Atonement that He made for our sins incites us to turn to Him, to plead with our Father in Heaven for help and hope through Him, to turn to Him in gratitude and obedience. With even our limited understanding, we are moved to learn what He would have us learn, to do what He would have us do, and to become what He would have us become.<br /><br />I testify that He lives and He loves you. He is the creator of our world. He is the only begotten of the Father&mdash;the baby who fulfilled prophecies born of a mortal mother. He lived a perfect life and provided us a perfect example. He is the master teacher, the healer, the rest giver, the forgiver of sins, the master of elements, the keeper of covenants. He came to earth to suffer, to be rejected, to die and to rise again. He took upon Himself our pains, our sorrow, our sins and bore the unbearable price to rescue us. He died and rose again on the third day, conquering death and forever changing the world. He is our advocate with the Father who stands betwixt you and justice<sup>21</sup>. One day He will come again to reign in glory on the earth. All of this because He knows you and because He loves you. This is the testimony I leave with you in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Over forty-five years ago, when Dallin H. Oaks was a law professor at the University of Chicago, he had a harrowing encounter that almost ended in bloody tragedy. One evening, after a late church meeting, Elder Oaks and his wife, June, drove another sister to her apartment building. Returning to the car after walking this sister to her door, he was accosted by a young man brandishing a gun. The agitated juvenile jabbed his barrel into Elder Oaks' belly, demanding all his money. When he discovered Elder Oaks didn't have any cash, he demanded access to the car where June was inside watching this terrifying drama through the window. Think for a second, how would&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;have responded to that threat? Elder Oaks chose to not give in to his demands. A stand-off ensued, and the young man threatened to kill him if he didn't comply. But Elder Oaks stood firm.<br /><br />At one point during this tense stalemate, the young man became distracted by a bus approaching behind him, out of his view, and he let his gun drift a bit to one side. Elder Oaks saw an opportunity, fully confident he could disarm the young man if he acted quickly to seize the weapon. Now what would&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;have done? Would you have made a grab for the gun? Elder Oaks almost did. But then something happened. "I did not see anything or hear anything, Elder Oaks said, "but I&nbsp;<em>knew</em>&nbsp;something. I knew what would happen if I grabbed that gun. We would struggle, and I would turn the gun into that young man's chest. It would fire, and he would die. I also understood that I must not have the blood of that young man on my conscience for the rest of my life."<sup>1</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>It was a surprising thought for Elder Oaks; his life and the life of this stranger, this young man who wanted to harm him, were intertwined. Either they both made it out alive or both of them would be damaged. And that simple thought, that connection, completely changed the situation. "I relaxed," Elder Oaks said, "and as the bus pulled away I followed an impulse to put my right hand on his shoulder and give him a lecture. June and I had some teenage children at that time, and giving lectures came naturally. 'Look here,' I said. 'This isn't right. What you're doing just isn't right. The next car might be a policeman, and you could get killed or sent to jail for this.'"<sup>2</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Now it was the young man's turn to be surprised. The man he'd threatened to kill wasn't scared or angry, but was acting like a loving father, placing a warm hand on his shoulder and expressing genuine concern for his safety. This totally threw him off. "With the gun back in my stomach," Elder Oaks noted, "the young robber replied to my lecture by going through his demands for the third time. But this time his voice was subdued. When he offered the final threat to kill me, he didn't sound persuasive. When I refused again, he hesitated for a moment and then stuck the gun in his pocket and ran away."<sup>3</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>This encounter is remarkable on many levels, but notice how well Elder Oaks followed counsel our Savior gave about how to overcome violence and aggression. "Love your enemies," he told his astonished disciples, "bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Two thousand years later, that counsel still astonishes us.<br /><br />It astonishes us because at first glance it doesn't seem like very practical advice for overcoming violence. It runs counter to our intuition, and the wisdom of the world. "Love is nice," the world tells us, "but in the face of aggression or lethal violence, it is weak and ineffective. In such situations we need something stronger than love." Only violence can overcome violence, the world tells us, and so our choice in the face of violence is to either fight back or surrender or flee. Think about how often this message is reinforced in our culture. How many times have most of us watched a movie where a hero or heroine has used some type of verbal or physical violence to defeat an enemy? How many times have some of us employed a virtual weapon in a video game to destroy a virtual "bad guy"? Now think about how well we may have absorbed these lessons. How often do we celebrate the violence we see in the movies? Or enjoy video game violence? When someone verbally attacks us online, at work, at school, or in our neighborhoods and homes, is our instinct to strike back (or fantasize about striking back)? We live in a world saturated with a simple logic: violence is the only effective answer to violence.<br /><br />But the experience of Elder Oaks and the words of our Savior prove that the world's logic is flawed. Counter-attacking isn't the only way to resist violence. It isn't even the most effective. Love can stand up to and overcome violence. In fact, love is actually more powerful and more effective than a counter-attack. Love is bold. Love is potent. We don't often think of it in those terms, but love is capable of disarming violence. The master of the universe, the Great Jehovah, has unsheathed a formidable weapon&mdash;the sword of his divine love&mdash;and he invites us to follow him, to "rise in might," wield a similar "sword of truth and right," and boldly vanquish our foes by conquering their aggression with our love.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><strong>The Power of Turning the Other Cheek</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Unfortunately, the potency of our Savior's counsel is too often dismissed, distorted, or watered down, and many "plain and precious parts" of his original message have been lost.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Consider, for example, a phrase that initially held extraordinary power, but has since become a somewhat weak clich&eacute;: "Turn the other cheek." When people use this phrase, they are usually implying that when someone attacks us we should do nothing in response. But this is the opposite of what the phrase originally meant. Our Savior was actually showing his ancient disciples how to lovingly resist and transform their attackers. This might not seem obvious at first, but it becomes easier to perceive if we better understand the cultural context in which the phrase was first uttered. As biblical scholar Walter Wink has pointed out the precise wording is crucial, "whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Why the right cheek? Is this particular detail important? It must be, because Jesus repeated it to the people in the Promised Land.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But to understand why, we have to understand that in the ancient world right and left hands were considered respectively clean and unclean, and used for different purposes. Ancient people used their right hands to smite, so to strike someone's right cheek meant hitting with the&nbsp;<em>back</em>&nbsp;of the right hand. To backhand others in this manner was, and still is, an attempt to assert dominance. Ancient people backhanded other people they believed were subordinate or inferior&mdash;servants, children, or women&mdash;and aggressors expected subordinates to cower and submit. Occasionally subordinates might strike back, trying to assert their dominance, but such responses could lead to vicious retaliation.<br /><br />Our Savior offered a revolutionary alternative; turning the other, or left, cheek. This doesn't seem revolutionary to us because, again, we miss the cultural significance. It is impossible to use a right hand to backhand a left cheek. To strike a left cheek, an attacker must use an open palm or a closed fist. But in the ancient world, striking with a palm or fist was only for people of equal social standing. So turning the left cheek presented an attacker with a cleverly constructed choice: either back away from your violence or strike again as my equal. This choice also communicated a powerful truth. It said: "I will not submit to your violence, neither will I be provoked into responding in kind, but I will firmly resist your violence with my love." Under the best of circumstances, aggressors would come to their senses, repent of their violence and seek reconciliation. But even if they didn't, such firm but loving resistance effectively thwarted their goal of domination. This is the true significance and power of "turning the other cheek."<br /><br /><strong>Extinguishing the Fires of Violence</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>So, if we don't have eyes to see we can miss love's potency; its capacity to challenge, overcome, and thwart physical, emotional, or verbal violence. There is nothing mystical or magical about this power. Love overcomes violence in practical and easily understood ways, similar to the way water extinguishes fire. A fire needs three elements to sustain itself: a fuel source, oxygen, and heat. If any of these elements are sufficiently reduced or eliminated&mdash;if the fuel is removed, if the oxygen supply is smothered, or the temperature is cooled&mdash;the fire dies. With wood fires, water works at all three levels: cooling, smothering, and transforming the fuel into something that is no longer combustible.<br /><br />Similar to fire, violence needs certain elements to sustain itself. First, violence needs a rationale to justify its existence. Everyone who uses violence usually feels they have a good reason. People believe they&nbsp;<em>have to</em>&nbsp;attack, physically or verbally, because they feel endangered or feel they must avenge some past harm or wrong. Laman and Lemuel, after all, felt threatened by Nephi's leadership.9\<sup>9</sup>Likewise, Ammoron felt he had to avenge the death of his brother Amalickiah.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;We often behave the same way. The greater the threat or past harm&mdash;whether from a coworker, or a family member, or a roommate&mdash;the more justified we feel in striking back.<br /><br />Second, violence feeds on distance. It is easier to lob a bomb from miles away than to strike someone at arm's length. And it is easier to make a snide remark online than to say it face-to-face. With geographic distance we can dismiss or ignore the effects of our violence. But emotional distance, a sense of disconnection, what the scriptures call "love [that] "wax[es] cold," is even more crucial.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;It is easier to harm someone whom we perceive as separate from rather than connected to us. The greater the distance, the easier it is to perpetuate physical or verbal violence.<br /><br />Third, violence counts on a predictable response; either fight or flight. When the Gadianton robbers threatened the Nephites, they expected their intended victims to either fight back or submit to their rule.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;When others fight back, their violence creates a new reason for our violence, because now we have to defend ourselves. Likewise, when people cower or flee or submit to our violence, their behavior helps justify our aggression because their weakness becomes an invitation for us to dominate. Our violence was effective, and so we use it again.<br /><br />Just as water reduces and eliminates the elements that sustain wood fires, so love reduces and eliminates the elements that sustain violence. Authentic concern for our attackers makes it difficult for them to maintain a sense of endangerment or grievance, starving violence of its essential fuel source. Love closes distance by establishing (or reestablishing) vital human connections. These connections can be physical, as when Elder Oaks put his hand on the shoulder of his young assailant, but more importantly they&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;be emotional; acknowledging and reinforcing the divine ties that bind all of God's children together. Finally, love is unpredictable. By neither fighting back nor fleeing nor surrendering, love stands strong in the face of aggression, eliciting awe in attackers. And in that moment of wonder, starved of fuel and sensing emotional connection, the fires of violence quietly yet quickly die out.<br /><br /><strong>Loving "Bloodthirsty" Lamanites</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>We can observe these principles in the dynamic between the Nephites and the Lamanites. For centuries, they engaged in repeated cycles of violence, sustained by the three elements we've discussed. Each side stoked its&nbsp;<em>rationale</em>&nbsp;for violence based on generations of grievances. From the Lamanite perspective, all Nephites were "liars" and "robbers."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;From the Nephite perspective, all Lamanites were "stiff-necked" and "blood-thirsty."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;These grudges created and sustained a deep emotional and geographic distance. And when one group attacked, the other side usually gave a predictable response&mdash;either fighting back or fleeing&mdash;which only reinforced each side's justification for their own violence.<br /><br />These cycles might have gone on indefinitely, but then the sons of King Mosiah did something rather remarkable&mdash;they went out to meet their traditional adversaries armed with the sword of compassion. Long before our Savior told his astonished disciples to love their enemies, these precocious young men were already doing it. They felt no anger, no hatred, no fear&mdash;only deep and genuine empathy, "for they could not bear that&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;human soul [including their enemies] should perish."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;So they went straight for the heart of their enemies, so to speak&mdash;journeying into their territory, offering to serve them, bridging the wide geographic and emotional distance. The humble gift of themselves undermined Lamanite grievances against Nephites, and utterly bewildered these long-standing adversaries, throwing them off balance, reconfiguring their cultural paradigm. This was not the way Nephites were&nbsp;<em>supposed</em>&nbsp;to act. In the same way Elder Oaks surprised and disarmed his attacker with genuine concern for his well being, the sons of Mosiah surprised and disarmed the Lamanites with their unexpected compassion. First King Lamoni, then his father, and ultimately tens of thousands of Lamanites were inspired to abandon their violence and be reconciled with their former enemies.<br /><br />These Lamanites were so deeply moved by the love of the sons of Mosiah, that when their own enemies came to destroy them, they buried their swords and went out to meet their attackers armed only with prayer, employing the same principles of love that had worked to transform them. And their compassion startled and touched their enemies so deeply that it extinguished the fires of violence in their hearts and they repented of their anger and aggression, throwing down their weapons and joining their enemies in prayer. Thus we see that the ripples of love spread far, and wide, and fast. A little-known painting by Minerva Teichert captures the power of this moment. In a telling but easily overlooked detail, Teichert employs a brush of red in the palm of an expectant defender, subtly yet vividly connecting his willingness to absorb violence, his willingness to give &nbsp;rather than take from his enemies, to the ultimate gift and sacrifice of his Master, Jesus Christ.<br /><br /><strong>Acquiring the Strength to Love</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Of course, our Savior's compassionate life and self-sacrificing death are the most powerful examples of exactly how to love one's enemies. His mortal path was one of noble and potent love, absorbing brutal violence from both Jewish and Roman authorities without striking back or surrendering. Rather, with quiet dignity he firmly insisted on demonstrating his infinite love, speaking words of hope to the other malefactors at Calvary and even forgiving the soldiers who carried out his crucifixion, causing one of them to proclaim: "Certainly this was a righteous man."<sup>16</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Unlike our Savior's suffering in Gethsemane, a burden only he could bear and which he has never invited us to share, his suffering of the cross is a path he has repeatedly invited us to follow. &nbsp;"[C]ome, take up the cross, and follow me," he calls to us. Be willing to absorb violence rather than inflict it, because the way of the cross is love; to bless them that curse us, to do good to them that hate us, to pray for those who despitefully use us and persecute us, the way he loved and served.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Of course we cannot develop such remarkable love without his divine assistance, but it is there for the asking. As Mormon taught, all we have to do is "pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that [we] may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;And when we ask for it, the love will come to heal our hurt and our hate, our anguish and our anger, for us and for our enemy. This is his loving gift to us and for us.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as with any gift, we must practice using the sword of compassion if we want to learn how to wield it with strength and courage. The U.S. military has a training pattern that might serve as a model in this regard. Known as "Reflexive Fire Training," soldiers practice shooting their weapons over and over and over in simulated combat situations. They do this so rapidly and so often that their muscles and reflexes become finely honed to pull their triggers without any conscious thought. In a similar way we might train ourselves to wield weapons of love. Over and over and over, in our daily interactions and petty conflicts&mdash;when a roommate or a family member yells at us, or when we are assaulted with snarky comments on social media, or anytime anyone intentionally or unintentionally abuses us&mdash;we can, with our Savior' help, train our mental muscles and moral reflexes to not strike back, nor surrender, but to resist the violence with our love.<br /><br />We learn to wield the sword of compassion when we respond to "wrath" with firm yet "soft" and loving "answers."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;We hone our skills in the weapons of love when we refuse to be drawn into anger or hate, no matter how much the world tells us we are justified in those feelings. We learn how to resist violence with love when we refuse to bow or surrender to other people's anger or aggression, and instead find ways to minister to our attackers; to feed, and clothe, and visit, and pray for them.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Every time we choose to stand and love instead of strike back or shrink away, every time we serve instead of surrender or retaliate, we improve our responses and build moral muscle memory. Again, the enabling power of our Savior's atonement will guide us if we let it. And the more we hone these divine reflexes the better prepared we will be when the next moment of crisis comes, as it always does, at a time and in a place where we least expect it; on a dark Chicago street after a church meeting, or in our apartment, or at our workplace, or some other location we can hardly now imagine. Moreover, the better each of us<em>individually</em>&nbsp;enhances our skill with love, the easier it will be to&nbsp;<em>collectively</em>&nbsp;answer threats with a coordinated force of compassionate warriors&mdash;"Zion's army," as the hymn goes&mdash;lovingly resisting and overcoming the culture of violence that seems poised to consume our modern world.<br /><br /><strong>The Fearless Way of Love</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Of course, as with any weapon, wielding the sword of compassion is a risky enterprise, requiring extraordinary courage, even fearlessness. There have been and will be serious casualties, perhaps even death, because the way of love isn't safe or foolproof. Love can come with a cost, as it did for our Savior, the one who wielded it best. Violence can even seem to triumph for a time. Furthermore, there may be some people who are "past feeling," who have placed themselves beyond confrontational compassion. Yet such people are rare, much rarer than the world would have us believe, as the Sons of Mosiah demonstrated with their love for the supposedly "stiffnecked" and "bloodthirsty" Lamanites. This much is sure: resisting violence with compassion is more effective than resisting it with violence. It may not work every time. No weapon ever does. Even righteous Nephite generals suffered many defeats. But love will work more often than anything else, a fact that is increasingly supported by modern research.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Of course this shouldn't surprise us. After all, love is the higher way of God, and though his ways may seem "foolish" and "weak" to the world, "the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men."<sup>22</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>Love may seem weak or soft, yet it is not. It is firm. It is robust. But in order for it to work, any love we have for our enemies&mdash;whether we find them at home, or at work, or in our communities, or our politics, or some distant land&mdash;must be genuine. Antoinette Tuff, an elementary school bookkeeper who stopped a mass-shooting at her school by expressing sincere compassion for her attacker, later told a reporter: "He was really a hurting young man... I didn't know his name. I didn't know much about him. But I did love him."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Such capacity to imitate our Savior, to see beyond the immediate threat, to look past the anger and aggression, to see him as a flesh and blood person rather than as just an attacker is remarkable. Likewise, for each of us to go against our cultural training and choose divine love is a tall order, to be sure. But I have faith that we can achieve it, because our Savior said we can, and promised to help us, and I believe him. We can be Zion's army&mdash;compassionate warriors whose coordinated efforts vanquish their foes by collectively serving them&mdash;because principles of loving resistance apply not only to individuals and families, but also to communities and nations. In a world awash in the logic of violence, the best responses to current threats&mdash;in our nations and in our families&mdash;are the same ones proclaimed two thousand years ago: "love your enemies" and "be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;We have the commitment, the creativity, and the spiritual resources to figure out how marshal our collective capacity for compassion in the struggle against evil. And with heaven's help we will figure it out, fulfilling a prediction made by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a philosopher and theologian: "Some day," he said, "after we have mastered space, the winds, the waves, the tides, and gravity, we will harness for God the energies of love. And then, for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;This is the future for which most of us yearn&mdash;a future filled with the fires of love rather than the fires of violence&mdash;and if we take up our crosses and follow our Savior, he will lead us to that blessed land. This I know and promise you, in the name of him who is the embodiment of extraordinary, genuine, and transforming love, even Jesus Christ, amen.<sup>26</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>General Authority Seventy</p>
<p>Elder Michael T. Ringwood was sustained a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The<br /><br /> Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 4, 2009, at age 51.</p>
<p>Elder Ringwood graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in accounting from Brigham Young University in 1983. In 1986 he became vice president of the Huntsman Corporation and remained there for fourteen years. In 2000 he was named president of Bear Creek Foods and more recently, president and chief financial officer of Packsize LLC. In addition he was a member of the Board of Advisers at the BYU School of Accountancy.</p>
<p>Elder Ringwood has served in a number of Church callings, including a full-time missionary in the Korea Seoul Mission, bishop, high councilor, high priests group leader, Scoutmaster, stake president, and mission president. He is currently serving at Church headquarters.</p>
<p>Michael Tally Ringwood was born in Provo, Utah, on February 14, 1958. He married Rosalie Nelson in December 1982 in the Jordan River Temple. They are the parents of five children and reside in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is an honor to be standing here today. I am grateful for the invitation from the First Presidency to address you this afternoon. My prayers relating to this assignment have often been focused on you. I found myself praying that you would come today prepared to be taught by the Spirit. My faith is that you will be blessed with answers and inspiration needed. I have sought help from Heaven in what I might speak about today. I am grateful for inspiration that came in the early morning hours back in December to speak to you about the power of the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>Let me begin today with an experience that I had several years ago. While serving as a stake president for a married student stake in Salt Lake City, we planned a temple night. It was busy that night at the temple. Mid-point of our temple work we experienced a delay that allowed us to sit quietly and ponder. I found myself thinking about the experience in the Book of Mormon where Lehi sent his sons back to Jerusalem to obtain their scriptures, the brass plates held by Laban.</p>
<p>We all know that story. Laman and Lemuel were not excited for this assignment. That is what we call murmuring, correct? It was a hard thing and they were not excited about making the journey back home. Can you really blame them? Scholars estimate it was about 500 miles round trip and would have taken at least three weeks (Thomas R. Valletta,&nbsp;<em>The Book of Mormon Study Guide</em>&nbsp;[2015], 27). I don't think they were all that willing to venture out into the wilderness and leave everything behind and then here dad is, after making them leave, asking them to return and do something hard.<br /><br />I then began thinking about Nephi and his attitude. It helped that his father told him his older brothers were not excited, but that he had received a commandment of the Lord and encouraged Nephi that if he would go without murmuring, he would be favored of the Lord.&nbsp;It was then that Nephi spoke the words that most Latter-day Saints have memorized. "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he hath commandeth them." (1 Nephi 3:7)<br /><br />Soon I began to think about the second trip back to Jerusalem. This time there was no murmuring. They were being sent to find wives and it appears that Laman and Lemuel were actually excited about this trip. As I pondered this, I wondered why they were not sent to bring wives the first time and scriptures the second or at least accomplish both tasks in one trip. As I thought about the fact that there were two trips and the order in which they came, I felt a message that said it is important to establish a pattern of righteousness, valuing and using the scriptures, before entering into the most important relationship in time and in eternity. There was wisdom in obtaining the plates first. Two trips were necessary to emphasize this pattern.<br /><br />Soon after Lehi reviewed the plates, their scriptures, he stated that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children. Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry them with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land of promise. (1 Nephi 5:21-22) I remind you that our promised land is any land where we can make promises that will allow us to live with our families and with Heavenly Father for eternity.<br /><br />Just as scriptures were vital to Lehi and his family, I testify to you that the scriptures are equally vital for us if we wish to reach our promised lands and our eternal potentials. We especially need the power of the Book of Mormon. It is indeed wisdom in the Lord that we should carry it with us as we journey through life.<br /><br />Elder Jeffrey R. Holland spoke to students at BYU on January 17, 1989. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Let me use an example from what is often considered by foes, and even by some friends, as the most unsavory moment in the entire Book of Mormon. I choose it precisely because there is so much in it that has given offense to many. It is pretty much a bitter cup all the way around.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I speak of Nephi's obligation to slay Laban in order to preserve a record, save a people, and ultimately lead to the restoration of the gospel in the dispensation of the fullness of times. How much is hanging in the balance as Nephi stands over the drunken and adversarial Laban I cannot say, but it is a very great deal indeed.</p>
<p>He then explained that although we now know how important this moment was, Nephi did not. He had always been taught he should not kill. He had covenanted to obey the commandments. Nevertheless, he was constrained by the Spirit that he should kill Laban (1 Nephi 4:10). Elder Holland continued:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We don't know why those plates could not have been obtained some other way&mdash;perhaps accidentally left at the plate polishers one night or maybe falling out the back of Laban's chariot on a Sabbath afternoon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For that matter, why didn't Nephi just leave this story out of the book altogether? Why didn't he say something like, 'And after much effort and anguish of spirit, I did obtain the plates of Laban and did depart into the wilderness unto the tent of my father?' At the very least he might have buried the account somewhere in the Isaiah chapters, thus guaranteeing that it would have gone undiscovered up to this very day.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But there it is, squarely in the beginning of the book&mdash;page 8&mdash;where even the most casual reader will see it&nbsp;<em>and must deal with it.&nbsp;</em>It is not intended that either Nephi&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>we be spared the struggle of this account. ("The Will of the Father," BYU Speeches, January 17, 1989)</p>
<p>As I have considered Elder Holland's words, I believe that this was included at the beginning of the record partly to help us understand just how important the scriptures are and specifically how important the record that Nephi was writing would be to us.</p>
<p>I desire to impress upon your minds the power the Book of Mormon can provide in the journey to your Promised Land. Let me testify to each of you that the Book of Mormon was worth the sacrifices that were made to write it, preserve it, and bring it forth in our day because it is the word of God. It will lead us to do good. We can and must know it is true and pass the book and our testimonies of it to future generations.</p>
<p><strong>The Word of God</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The Book of Mormon is the word of God. We are taught that from the 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;chapter of 2 Nephi. This chapter tells about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon in the latter days and we are told that the words in this book are the words of God. Verse 14 contains a warning to those in our day when it says, "wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God!" (2 Nephi 27:14). This sentence ends with an exclamation point.<br /><br />As Nephi explains the meaning of the dream of the tree of life, he tells us that the rod of iron represented the word of God. He then promised that "whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto darkness, to lead them away to destruction" (1 Nephi 15:24).<br /><br />This book containing the word of God also teaches us to believe in Christ. Nephi, in talking about what he was writing in the records that would become our Book of Mormon, said: "For we labor diligently to write, to&nbsp;persuade&nbsp;our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by&nbsp;grace&nbsp;that we are saved, after all we can&nbsp;do" (2 Nephi 25:23). Nephi reinforces this purpose of the Book of Mormon when he writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The words which I have spoken shall stand as a&nbsp;testimony&nbsp;against you; for they are sufficient to&nbsp;teach&nbsp;any man the&nbsp;right&nbsp;way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not; for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and&nbsp;worship&nbsp;him with all your&nbsp;might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out" (2 Nephi 25:28-29).</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer taught if we study the scriptures and understand them we can say we have heard the voice of the Lord. (Doctrine and Covenants 18:35-36) He added "what is taught in the scriptures is most worth knowing" (BKP, GA Training 3/31/2011 see also Mormon 8:14).</p>
<p>I add my testimony that the Book or Mormon is the word of God and it will teach us to believe in Christ. It will teach us the right way! That is worth knowing.</p>
<p><strong>To Do Good</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Nephi ends his writing in the Book of Mormon with the promise that the words written in this book will persuade us to do good and to endure to the end.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great&nbsp;worth, and especially unto my people. For I&nbsp;pray&nbsp;continually for them by day, and mine&nbsp;eyes water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my cry.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my people. And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong unto them; for it&nbsp;persuadeth&nbsp;them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life&nbsp;eternal (2 Nephi 33:3-4).</p>
<p>Nephi adds that the words in this book are the words of Christ and they were given to him to write and that they teach all men that they should do good (2 Nephi 33:10).</p>
<p>Alma likened the Liahona to the scriptures:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these things are not without a&nbsp;shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to this compass... they did not prosper;...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the&nbsp;word&nbsp;of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the Promised Land.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now I say, is there not a&nbsp;type&nbsp;in this thing? For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the Promised Land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">O my son, do not let us be&nbsp;slothful&nbsp;because of the easiness&nbsp;of the&nbsp;way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would&nbsp;look&nbsp;they might&nbsp;live; even so it is with us. The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, my son, see that ye take&nbsp;care&nbsp;of these sacred things, yea, see that ye&nbsp;look&nbsp;to God and live (Alma 37:43-47).</p>
<p>I love this part of the Book of Mormon. I add my testimony that the words written in this record are sacred. They will help us to do good. They will help us look to God and live!</p>
<p><strong>We Can Know</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In our day it is so easy to go to the Internet and read what everyone else thinks or feels about the Book of Mormon. We might be tempted to spend more time reading what is written there than reading the source document. The Book of Mormon is one of those books that must be read and experienced by each of us. It is one of those books that can't be understood through another person. It is a book, after all, that comes with a promise.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how&nbsp;merciful&nbsp;the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and&nbsp;ponder&nbsp;it in your&nbsp;hearts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would&nbsp;ask&nbsp;God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not&nbsp;true; and if ye shall ask with a&nbsp;sincere heart, with&nbsp;real intent, having&nbsp;faith&nbsp;in Christ, he will&nbsp;manifest&nbsp;the&nbsp;truth&nbsp;of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may&nbsp;know&nbsp;the truth&nbsp;of all things." (Moroni 10:3-5).</p>
<p>Millions of people have put this promise to the test and have gained a testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. I am one of those millions. For some the testimony may have come easily and quickly, but for most of us it takes time and effort to gain the testimony promised. For me it really did require me to remember how merciful Heavenly Father has been to His children from the days of Adam to our time. It required me to read with believing eyes and a believing heart and then with real intent. That means I had to let God know that I was willing to live in accordance with a witness if it was received. It required me to have the commitment to make changes to my life if the answer did come. I did ask of God and received that witness.<br /><br />If you have not yet received that witness for yourself, do not be discouraged. Lean on my witness. That is why I am here speaking to you today. Follow the same pattern I followed. It took time for me. It will take time for you. Do not give up. I find it very interesting that we only tend to value what comes at a cost and a price of intent and intensity. It is so important to know for ourselves. We must read from its pages and search the words personally. What is written in the pages of this book is so much more important than what is written about it by others.<br /><br />For those who have already been given a testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, remember that it can be lost so quickly. Keep reading, studying, and nurturing that testimony. Remember how it felt to receive your witness. Share that witness with others often. Christ taught the importance of having a personal witness when He appeared to the Nephites after His resurrection. After introducing himself he invited each person present to approach Him and feel the nail prints in his hands and feet. There were 2,500 people there that day. Have you ever wondered how long it took for each of them to come forward and feel for themselves? If it took five seconds for each person to experience this, Christ stood there for three-and-a-half hours. If it took 10 seconds he was there for seven hours. Yet He was willing to do that because He knows that each of us has to know for ourselves After the 2,500 came forward, we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and&nbsp;did&nbsp;feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship&nbsp;him (3 Nephi 11:15-17).</p>
<p>Christ could have asked Nephi to come forth and feel the nail mark in His hands and feet and then to let everyone else know via twitter, Instagram and Facebook, but He didn't. Some things are not to be experienced vicariously.</p>
<p>We must know for ourselves that Jesus is the Christ. The Book of Mormon can teach us that. We must know for ourselves that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. We need to experience it by ourselves, not through anyone else.</p>
<p>I promise you if you have a testimony of this book, no matter how easy or difficult it was to obtain it, if you continue a serious study of it your testimony will only strengthen. You will never lose it. I promise you, if you don't have a testimony now, if you begin a serious study of this book you will come to know by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. Remember the words of President Packer, "what is taught there is most worth knowing." Moroni promised that those who receive this record and condemn it not shall know of [even] greater things (Mormon 8:12).</p>
<p>This is a promise of revelation as we study this book!<br /><br />My love of the scriptures and the Book of Mormon really started while I served a mission in Seoul Korea. Where it really became a part of me, however, was after my mission.<br /><br />I am most grateful today for a wise mission president who committed me to do 14 things as I finished my mission. You will see the letter outlining these commitments and my signature on the screen. One of these, number nine, was to continue to love the scriptures and to read from them daily.<br /><br />It was that commitment that kept me from missing too many days in a row. It was that commitment that helped me reintroduce structure in my life similar to the mission field so I could study every day. For most of my married life I was diligent from Monday to Friday. I always knew when I needed to wake up so I could exercise and study before I needed to be at school and then later at work. Saturday belonged to my children and I didn't usually read on that day due to the constant going and coming from sports, dance and lessons. The point is that even though I didn't keep my commitment to read daily, I did read regularly. I established a positive pattern and habit. When I missed a day or two, I got right back on track quickly.<br /><br />When my oldest son was speaking in church before beginning his mission he made a statement that really helped me understand how grateful I was for my mission president, F. Ray Hawkins. He reported that each morning he would come upstairs to read the Book of Mormon with the family prior to going to school he always knew he would find his father at his desk reading the scriptures. I am indebted to a wise mission president for helping me have a generational impact on my son. If you have not begun a life-long commitment to study daily from the scriptures, I invite you to begin today. If you are doing this, I invite you to continue. I am sure that many of the returned missionaries made a commitment to a mission president similar to mine. I invite you to be truly committed to do just what you were challenged to do. I would plead with you to make the Book of Mormon a large part of that daily commitment. When you slip, start again. Don't let one missed day turn into two and then three and four. Turn it around. This will be a blessing to you, but it will also impact your children. One day your own son or daughter may stand to speak in church and say, "I remember always seeing my dad and my mom reading the Book of Mormon."</p>
<p><strong>Generation to Generation</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In 2 Nephi 25 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I&nbsp;write&nbsp;shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never&nbsp;perish&nbsp;as long as the earth should stand.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the will and pleasure of God; and the nations who shall possess them shall be&nbsp;judged&nbsp;of them according to the words which are written" (2 Nephi 25:21-22).</p>
<p>Not only is the Book of Mormon written for us, it is meant to be passed down from generation to generation. Who gave you your first copy of the Book of Mormon? If you are not a first generation Latter-day Saint, it is likely that your first copy of the Book of Mormon came from your parents or grandparents. You, likewise, will pass down this wonderful book to your children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>When Alma turns over the custody of the records, which will become our Book of Mormon, as well as the many records which will become our Bible, he teaches Helaman about these future records.<br /><br />"Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be kept and&nbsp;handed&nbsp;down from one generation to another (Alma 37:4, 8).<br /><br />Not only can you pass the book to your children and their children, but you can pass along the example of your consistent and regular study habits.</p>
<p><strong>Testimonies of Truth</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>President Gordon B. Hinckley shared his testimony of the Book of Mormon this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is real. It has weight and substance which can be physically measured. I open its pages and read, and it has language both beautiful and uplifting. The ancient record from which it was translated came out of the earth as a voice speaking from the dust. It came as the testimony of generations of men and women who lived their lives upon the earth, who struggled with adversity, who quarreled and fought, who at various times lived the divine law and prospered and at other times forsook their God and went down to destruction. It contains what has been described as the fifth Gospel, a moving testament of the New World concerning the visit of the resurrected Redeemer on the soil of this hemisphere.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The evidence for its truth, for its validity in a world that is prone to demand evidence, lies not in archaeology or anthropology, though these may be helpful to some. It lies not in word research or historical analysis, though these may be confirmatory. The evidence for its truth and validity lies within the covers of the book itself. The test of its truth lies in reading it. It is a book of God. Reasonable people may sincerely question its origin; but those who have read it prayerfully have come to know by a power beyond their natural senses that it is true, that it contains the word of God, that it outlines saving truths of the everlasting gospel, that it "came forth by the gift and power of God ... to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ" (Book of Mormon&nbsp;title page).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is here. It must be explained. It can be explained only as the translator himself explained its origin. Hand in hand with the&nbsp;Bible, whose companion volume it is, it stands as another witness to a doubting generation that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. It is an unassailable cornerstone of our faith ("Four Cornerstones of Faith,"&nbsp;<em>Ensign,</em>&nbsp;February, 2004).</p>
<p>In August of 2005, President Hinckley challenged the whole church to read the Book of Mormon before the end of that year. In doing so he made this promise:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Without reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe this simple program, regardless of how many times you previously may have&nbsp;read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God.</p>
<p>He also said this in that same article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Book of Mormon narrative is a chronicle of nations long since gone. But in its descriptions of the problems of today's society, it is as current as the morning newspaper and much more definitive, inspired, and inspiring concerning the solutions of those problems...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While the Book of Mormon speaks with power to the issues that affect our modern society, the great and stirring burden of its message is a testimony, vibrant and true, that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Messiah, He who walked the dusty roads of Palestine healing the sick and teaching the doctrines of salvation; who died upon the cross of Calvary; who on the third day came forth from the tomb, appearing to many. Prior to His final Ascension, He visited the people of this Western Hemisphere, concerning whom He earlier had said, "And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd (John 10:16) (Gordon B. Hinckley Ensign, August, 2005).</p>
<p>I encourage you to read The Book of Mormon. I encourage you to experience it personally. It is the word of God. It will lead you to do good. You can know it is true and you can pass it on to future generations.</p>
<p>We all need power as we deal with this life. There is daily power to be gained as we read the Book of Mormon again and again. You can feel that power by deeply studying the Book of Mormon every day. And as you do this you have the promise that God&nbsp;will&nbsp;lead you to your land of promise.</p>

<p>Registrar</p>
<p>Kyle Martin has served as the Registrar at BYU-Idaho for the past nine years. Previous to that he was an Assistant Director in the Admissions Office. As a Rexburg native he has had an affiliation with Ricks College and BYU-Idaho his entire life. Both of his parents worked at Ricks College for many years.<br /><br />After serving a mission for the Church in Brazil, Brother Martin graduated from Ricks College with an Associate Degree in Business Management. He subsequently attended Brigham Young University where he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Business Management with an emphasis in Computer Information Systems. He later earned a Master of Business Administration from Western Governors University.<br />Brother Martin currently serves as the Bishop of the Rexburg YSA 3rd Ward. He has also served as a high councilor, ward clerk, and in a young men presidency and a bishopric. <br /><br />While attending BYU he met Alisha Dayley from Rigby, Idaho. They were married in 1996 and have one daughter and three sons. Their favorite past time is playing golf as a family.</p>

<p>In my work as the registrar I have responsibilities for the implementation of policies, processes and systems that affect each and every one of you during each term you are enrolled at BYU-Idaho. As significant as these responsibilities are, they seem straightforward and doable as I look at you from this pulpit and consider my responsibility to you on this singular occasion. Nonetheless, I am confident the Lord can magnify both you and me, and I pray that we will have the companionship of the Holy Ghost to attend us today so we may understand and be edified together.<sup><sup>1</sup></sup><br /><br />Over the years, I have noticed a pattern that devotional speakers often draw upon their various roles in life to shape their messages. I will continue that pattern today. However, as dynamic and fascinating as the work and world of a registrar and his attendant record-keeping duties might be, I have instead drawn upon my role as the bishop of a young single adult ward for my topic. Specifically, I want to share with you what I have learned about building a solid foundation. My message about the importance of good record-keeping will have to wait for another day in a different setting&mdash;I am sure my children will look forward to that message as an intriguing, suspenseful family home evening lesson.<br /><br />At the end of the Sermon on the Mount, the Savior taught about foundations. He said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Therefore whosever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.<sup><sup>2</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>The specific foundation I want to address today is the foundation of your dating and marriage relationships. As you know, "...the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children."<sup><sup>3</sup></sup>&nbsp;Much has been taught about the divine nature of the family, and I believe most of you have at least a basic understanding of the need and desire to marry a worthy man or woman. Therefore, I will focus on how to build your relationships on a solid foundation. I firmly believe that by applying the principles I will share today you will be laying the foundation for a rich, robust and long-lasting&mdash;even eternal&mdash;relationship. I do want to say, however, that my message is intended to provide some guidelines and may not be comprehensive. You should counsel with the Lord, your parents, ecclesiastical leaders, and other trusted associates as you seek to make these important decisions.</p>
<p>First, let's identify some foundational characteristics of a strong, healthy relationship. These are the core elements that must be present for any relationship to be successful. This is not a long list, and this list might not be all-inclusive. However, all healthy relationships must have these core elements to work. These characteristics will include respect, trust, selflessness, repentance, forgiveness, commitment, and communication.<br /><br />If your relationship is built on these foundational characteristics you will understand the inherent worth of your spouse as a child of God. You will rely on his or her integrity, strength, and surety. You will focus on and be attentive to his or her needs and desires, without continual comparison to your own. You will be patient with your spouse's imperfections and seek to identify and strengthen your own weaknesses. You will be loyal and faithful in thought, word and deed. You will work to understand one another with patience, meekness, and humility.</p>
<p>Marriage comes with many wonderful, exciting and rewarding experiences. It is the relationship through which true happiness can be achieved in both this life and the next. In reality, however, it also comes with challenges, frustrations, and opportunities for growth. Therefore, we must build our relationships on these foundational characteristics so we can "...have a marriage in which [we and our] children live in joy and happiness,"<sup><sup>4</sup></sup>&nbsp;as President Spencer W. Kimball once counseled.<br /><br />I cannot emphasize enough the importance of building your marriage relationship on these foundational characteristics. This is the gospel plan; our Heavenly Father wants a man and a woman who are compatible and seek to make and keep sacred covenants to build a wholesome, worthy relationship on these foundational characteristics. Then, the man and the woman are prepared to experience marriage as President Kimball outlined. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While marriage is difficult, and discordant and frustrated marriages are common, yet real, lasting happiness is possible, and marriage can be more an exultant ecstasy than the human mind can conceive. This is within the reach of every couple, every person. 'Soul mates' are fiction and an illusion; and while every young man and young woman will seek with all diligence and prayerfulness to find a mate with whom life can be most compatible and beautiful, yet it is certain that almost any good man and any good woman can have happiness and a successful marriage if both are willing to pay the price.<sup><sup>5</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>An important part of paying the price is building your relationship on these foundational characteristics.</p>
<p>The process by which we build the foundation for a robust, healthy relationship is exciting and exhilarating. We were reminded of this when, in the April 2015 General Conference, President Boyd K. Packer spoke of his budding romance with Sister Packer while they were both attending Weber College. As you will recall, he would wait outside of Sister Packer's home economics class, and "she would slip out with a cookie and a kiss."<sup><sup>6</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>As you build your relationship with that special someone you will make emotional commitments with him or her. Making and keeping those emotional commitments will then bring a desire to express those commitments through physical affection. A vital element of building a healthy relationship is to understand the role of physical expressions of affection in the context of your emotional commitments. With this in mind, I would like to discuss how emotional commitment levels and physical expressions of affection should be aligned.<br /><br />For the purposes of our discussion today, I will define four emotional commitment levels: friendship, dating (not exclusively), courting (dating exclusively through engagement), and marriage. With each of these four emotional commitment levels, there are appropriate expressions of physical affection. For example, the emotional commitment level of friendship might include a handshake, high-five, knuckles, or a "pat" hug.<br /><br />The emotional commitment level of dating might include him opening the door for her, holding hands as he leads her onto the dance floor or through a crowd. It might include her giving him a brief hug at the end of the date.<br /><br />Next, the emotional commitment level of courting might include strolling arm-in-arm as you discuss the unlimited possibilities of a future together, him putting his arm around her during a concert or play, or her showing him she cares with a "cookie and a kiss." This kiss, however, should not be passionate.<br /><br />You may wonder where you should draw the line when expressing physical affection in a relationship during the friendship, dating, and courting emotional commitment levels. Thankfully, the Lord's prophets and apostles have been very clear on where to draw the line. In&nbsp;<em>For the Strength of Youth</em>&nbsp;we read,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Never do anything that could lead to sexual transgression. Treat others with respect, not as objects used to satisfy lustful and selfish desires. Before marriage, do not participate in passionate kissing, lie on top of another person, or touch the private, sacred parts of another person's body, with or without clothing. Do not do anything else that arouses sexual feelings. Do not arouse those emotions in your own body. Pay attention to the promptings of the Spirit so that you can be clean and virtuous. The Spirit will withdraw from one who is in sexual transgression.<sup><sup>7</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>That is the line. Sisters, if you find yourself in a situation in which you are approaching this line, give him a high-five and send him on his way. Or, brothers, be like Joseph in the presence of Potiphar's wife and flee.<sup><sup>8</sup></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the emotional commitment level of marriage between a man and a woman will include sexual intimacy. Again, in&nbsp;<em>For the Strength of Youth</em>&nbsp;we read, "Physical intimacy between husband and wife is beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife. God has commanded that sexual intimacy be reserved for marriage."<sup><sup>9</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>Having outlined the emotional commitment levels of a relationship that starts as a friendship and leads to marriage, you can clearly see how to keep your physical expressions of affection properly aligned with the emotional commitments you have made. Keeping the emotional commitments and physical expressions of affection properly aligned is critical to building a firm foundation.<br /><br />Additionally, understanding the emotional commitment levels can help you determine when moving from one level of your relationship to the next is appropriate. For example, as you interact as friends you can evaluate your interactions to determine if the foundational characteristics are present. If they are, it might be worth moving to the next emotional commitment level of dating. As you date, if the foundational characteristics begin to develop and deepen, it may be appropriate to move to the next emotional commitment level of courting. And, yes, if the foundational characteristics continue to grow and deepen and develop, that is an indicator that you ought to consider moving to the next emotional commitment level of marriage.<br /><br />The companionship of the Holy Ghost will be vital as you progress through the emotional commitment levels and determine if your relationship is built upon the foundational characteristics. He will provide promptings, thoughts, and feelings that you can trust as you decide if you should move forward in the relationship. To receive this divine guidance you must do those things that invite his presence. You must keep the physical expressions of affection properly aligned with the emotional commitments you have made.As important as this alignment is, I have found that too many young adults&mdash;married or single&mdash;do not have a sufficient understanding of why this alignment is important or how a misalignment between the emotional commitments and physical expressions affects the relationship. The world perpetually bombards you with incorrect and inappropriate messages that would undermine your ability to build a relationship on a solid foundation.<br /><br />We need to clearly understand that physical intimacy is ordained of God and is central to His plan of happiness. President Packer taught,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The commandment to multiply and replenish the earth has never been rescinded. It is essential to the plan of redemption and is the source of human happiness. Through the righteous exercise of this power, we may come close to our Father in Heaven and experience a fullness of joy, even godhood.&nbsp;<em>The power of procreation is not an incidental part of the plan; it is the plan of happiness; it is the key to happiness</em>."<sup><sup>10</sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>The proper alignment of emotional commitments and physical expression will strengthen and deepen your relationship.</p>
<p>Allowing the emotional commitments and physical expressions to get out of alignment will undermine and destroy the foundational characteristics of your relationship. Engaging in sexual intimacy outside of marriage is not based upon respect for the other person. It does not build trust as you violate commandments and covenants. It is selfish and focused on you. It undermines your commitment to one another. It closes the channels of communication.<br /><br />The world would have you believe that these standards of morality are old-fashioned or outdated. If it goes unchecked, the world's view can easily cloud your vision regarding the Lord's standards of morality. I would like to share two significant consequences that sexual transgression brings.<br /><br />First, it violates God's commandments. It is sin. Prophets both ancient and modern have taught the fundamental truth that "...the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife."<sup><sup>11</sup>&nbsp;</sup>Sin brings spiritual death and makes us ineligible to receive God's blessings. This is the Lord's standard. It is fixed, true and sure. It does not change with the cultural whims of a fallen world. You can no easier eliminate this truth than you can remove the earth from its orbit. It has always been central to His plan and always will be.<br /><br />Second, and maybe less understood, is the impact that inappropriate physical intimacy has on the relationship itself. When you express physical affection that is out of alignment with the emotional commitment you have made, the foundational characteristics of your relationship are immediately undermined. They are weakened. They begin to erode. The fissures that begin to take hold in the foundational characteristics are a natural consequence of making choices that are contrary to the covenants you have made. Left unattended, these fissures will continue to grow and deepen and, ultimately, cause the foundation of your relationship to crumble. You are free to choose how you will act. However, the consequences are fixed and immovable. When you choose to live according to the Lord's standard you receive His blessing. When you choose to live contrary to the Lord's standard you lose His blessing.<br /><br />When you engage in sexual intimacy outside the bonds of marriage you relinquish the two things you want most for what you want in the heat of the moment. First, you forfeit the blessings your Heavenly Father has prepared for you, including the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Second, you sacrifice the foundational characteristics of the relationship that would otherwise bring you happiness and joy. Relationships are built when the emotional commitments and physical expressions are properly aligned. Relationships are destroyed when the emotional commitments and physical expressions are not properly aligned.<br /><br />A natural question might be if a relationship can be repaired after the emotional commitments and physical expressions have been misaligned. I believe the answer in most cases is, yes, they can. To repair the foundation you need to change; or, in other words, you need to repent. Because sexual transgression is serious in the Lord's eyes, you need to visit with your bishop. I recognize the prospect of such a visit can be intimidating, embarrassing, and overwhelming. However, I know from my service as a bishop that your bishop loves you. When your bishop was set apart he received priesthood keys for you. As the mantle rests on him in his sacred calling, his capacity to love and understand is enhanced and strengthened. He wants to help you through the process of changing, of repenting, of helping you qualify once again for God's blessings, of having the companionship of the Holy Ghost. If you have made choices that have caused your emotional commitments and physical expressions of affection to be misaligned, please visit with your bishop. Do not delay. All is not lost. There is hope. He will help you see the way to peace and happiness.<br /><br />As you prepare for and approach marriage, having a solid foundation in place by keeping your relationship emotionally and physically aligned is critical so you can weather the storms that will inevitably come your way. In some form or another, you will experience challenges in your relationship after you are married. As the responsibility and weight of life settle in, you may wake up one morning, look at that person lying next to you and think, "Wow, this person is annoying!" If you have built a relationship on the foundational characteristics we have discussed today, you will quickly realize you are just having an off day. Those days happen. You will have hope that tomorrow will be better&mdash;and it will be.</p>
<p>However, if you have built your relationship on physical intimacy and you wake up one morning and find your spouse to be annoying, what will you fall back on? The very thing that was holding you together is now gone. In fact, the very thing that was holding you together may now be driving you apart. Bruce C. Hafen, a former President of Ricks College and member of the First Quorum of the Seventy once shared the following thought at a Ricks College and a BYU Devotional:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Because sexual desire is in the minds of most people coupled with the idea of love, they are easily misled to conclude that they love each other when they really want each other physically. But if this desire is not stimulated by real love, it leaves strangers as far apart as they were before&mdash;sometimes it makes them ashamed of each other, or even makes them hate each other, because when the illusion has gone, they feel their estrangement even more markedly than before.<sup><sup>12</sup>&nbsp;</sup>In short, one might simply say: save your kisses&mdash;you might need them some day.<sup><sup>13</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>If you build your relationship on the sandy foundation of physical intimacy you will have a higher price to pay because building a solid foundation first is much less costly than assembling a glamorous fa&ccedil;ade and then trying to construct the foundation later.<br /><br />President Packer said it elegantly when he stated, "Married couples are tried by temptation, misunderstandings, financial problems, family crises, and illness, and all the while love grows stronger. Mature love has a bliss not even imagined by newlyweds."<sup><sup>14</sup>&nbsp;</sup>To achieve this bliss offered by mature love you must work today to build your relationship on the foundational characteristics of respect, trust, selflessness, repentance, forgiveness, commitment, and communication.<br /><br />With this understanding of the foundational characteristics of your relationship and the appropriate physical expressions of affection for each of the emotional commitment levels, I would like to explain how they are connected. The world would have you believe that you have a good relationship if you have a desire to be physical. However, this is not true. As we have already discussed, a healthy relationship cannot have a foundation based upon physical intimacy. This is what is meant by lust. The misalignment of emotional commitments and physical expressions of affection is really just another way to describe lust. In&nbsp;<em>A Parent's Guide</em>, a manual published by the Church, we are taught that "Lust dulls the senses and encourages people to increasingly bizarre efforts to feel pleasure. Lustful men and women, married or not, will be preoccupied with selfish mental or physical gratification of their appetites without feeling the joy of natural affection."<sup><sup>15</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>As you know, the Lord's plan is different. Once again from&nbsp;<em>A Parent's Guide</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...intimacy between husband and wife must be guided by righteous attitudes toward each other. The most sacred intimacy must be shared in a relationship characterized by genuine love. If we truly love others and desire their eternal joy&mdash;if we are our brother's keeper&mdash;our intimate relations as husband and wife will uplift rather than degrade... Virtuous behavior...does not reject the feeling and joy of the physical senses but provides a full and satisfying enjoyment of them.<sup><sup>16</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><sup></sup></sup>What we are being taught is that a real relationship is based upon the foundational characteristics of respect, trust, selflessness, repentance, forgiveness, commitment and communication. Sexual intimacy, then, is a sacred method by which a husband and wife express these foundational characteristics to one another. Because the relationship is built upon the foundational characteristics, there is nothing selfish or lustful about this expression. It is beautiful and worthy and wholesome. It enhances and enriches the relationship. It is central to the Creator's plan of happiness.</p>
<p>The innate desire you have to find a spouse, develop a strong, healthy relationship, to express the foundational characteristics of your relationship through physical intimacy, to have a family, and to build your life together comes from your Heavenly Father. Those desires are innate because that is the plan of happiness. It is now your responsibility to be a wise steward and to act according to the plan. &nbsp;<br /><br />Over the past couple of years I have come to understand that the clarity and beauty of the plan of happiness is being clouded over and debased by the unworthy messages the world is screaming on television shows, movies, web sites, and mobile apps. Too many of you have a superficial understanding of the Lord's law that governs a marital relationship&mdash;the law of chastity. Too many of you view the law of chastity as a simple list of things you cannot do until after you are married. While technically this might be true, this oversimplification is terribly incomplete and casts the power of procreation in the wrong light.<br /><br />Specifically, viewing the law of chastity as a list of things you cannot do until you are married can have the unintended consequence of leading you to believe that sexual intimacy is wrong or bad. Additionally, this limited view can also give the wrong impression that marriage is about sexual intimacy. Neither of these myths are accurate. First, the power of procreation is designed by our Heavenly Father and makes us like him. When employed according to His standards, it is right and good and beautiful. Second, marriage is about the foundational characteristics; it is about building a life together, it is about standing together and facing and weathering the storms that will inevitably come your way. Sexual intimacy is a sacred, ordained way by which husband and wife express the foundational characteristics and their commitment to one another.<br /><br />I encourage you to take some time to learn and understand how to build a solid foundation upon which the many important decisions you are making can rest for the remainder of your life. No decision you make during this time will be more important than the marriage decision. However, do not let the importance of this decision paralyze you. As you develop a friendship that grows into a dating relationship, which grows into a courtship, which grows into marriage, regularly take an inventory of the relationship to ensure that the foundational characteristics are present and accounted for.<br /><br />Elder Robert D. Hales offered timely and wise counsel in his October 2015 General Conference Address titled "Meeting the Challenges of Today's World." I highly recommend his message to you as you seek to build a strong relationship. Live up to your covenants by keeping your physical expressions of affection properly aligned with the emotional commitments you have made. As you do so you will be guided by the Holy Ghost in your decisions. You will make the right decisions. You will have built your house upon a solid foundation and the floods will come, the winds will blow and beat upon your house; and it will not fall because it is built upon a rock.<sup><sup>17</sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup><sup><sup><br /></sup></sup>In conclusion, I want to say that I am grateful for the plan of happiness. I am grateful for the rock upon which we can build our house. I am grateful for the Savior, Jesus Christ, for His teachings and His gospel. I am grateful for the light and guidance He gives in a world that is dark and confused. I know that He lives. I know that He knows and loves each one of us. I know that by following Him we will truly be happy. I testify of these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's a pleasure to be with you this afternoon and to have an opportunity to share some thoughts. I came to BYU-Idaho just over two years ago and in that time I have truly come to love devotional. Each week we are provided an opportunity to come together in faith and to share in the powerful spirit present in this building. I pray that same spirit will be with us today and that my words will not detract from that.</p>
<p>Today I would like to address the second sentence in the BYU-Idaho Mission Statement. In it we are reminded that the mission of BYU-Idaho "is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities".<sup>1</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>A few years ago, at the outset of 2011, I introduced to my family an idea that had been on my mind for some time. My brainstorm, received by some of my family with joy and excitement, and by others with a little anguish and trepidation, was to plan an excursion to backpack into the High Uinta Mountains in Utah and ascend Kings Peak. The High Uintas are a beautiful and rugged mountain range with plentiful opportunities for hiking, backpacking, and fishing. Unfortunately, each year some, who underestimate the rugged nature of this wilderness, get lost. Many are rescued after a few scary nights spent wandering the hills. Others experience serious injury, and in some cases lives are lost if the appropriate care is not taken. These are mountains that demand respect and will punish those who do not give it.<br /><br />Kings Peak sits atop this range and stands supreme as the highest peak in the state of Utah. It is only accessible to those willing to pay the price of an arduous outdoor adventure. I had on multiple occasions stood at the top of Utah and looked over the miles and miles of spectacular views and thought that the moment had been perfect, only to realize that the one thing that would have improved that moment would be to have my wife and children with me. That was the origin of the adventure we would embark on during the summer of 2011.<br /><br />There are more theories and approaches to leadership than one could possibly study in a lifetime. As we wade through the deluge of books, articles, TED talks, webinars, classes, and endless advice it becomes nearly impossible to find the secret recipe that will transform us into the perfect leader. Most of us are not dissuaded, however, and we continue to seek these elusive traits. I, for one, have spent plenty of time, and money contributing to the elevated stature and compensation of those deemed as visionary leaders in our world. To be fair, in that search I have learned much that has helped me in my life and in my career. Conversely, however, I have also discovered that certain aspects of leadership, as defined by the world leave me perplexed as to their effectiveness. In fact, as I have employed some of these strategies I have found their effects to be short lived in some cases and ineffective in others.<br /><br />As the sun rose on August 7, so did we. We ate breakfast, broke camp, and prepared for the day. I checked with each individual, balanced the loads, and adjusted backpacks. Satisfied, we gathered at the trailhead, prayed, took this picture that I love, and then departed. It was a glorious day; there was a brilliant blue sky, the temperature was perfect, and spirits were high. This was to be an incredible trip.<br /><br />We made great progress for a while, but as the miles began to pile up enthusiasm began to wane. Charlie, for example, our youngest hiker, began to realize how long this day really would be. Discouraged, he slowed, and we slowed with him. I realized we were falling behind schedule and that I needed to do something to motivate him. To this day the kids tease me about the story that I made up as I held Charlie's hand and hiked, side-by-side with him for probably five miles. Somehow, ideas came to my mind and I weaved a tale of intrigue, aliens, explosions, betrayals, and surprises.<br /><br />With Charlie distracted, our momentum increased. We made great progress for several miles and eventually we arrived at Henry's Fork Basin. Not long after, we came to our next obstacle. We had to cross a swelling Henry's Fork River. The bridge, constructed from trees and some rope, was safe, but crossing it tired and with the weight of the backpacks created some fear in a few of the team. After some coaching and motivation, everyone successfully forded the river.<br /><br />At this point, the trail slopes into a significant ascent that would be our most challenging climb of this first day. Not long after we began to climb, we were faced with our next challenge; Doug, our son-in-law, began to suffer with respiratory problems. The closer we got to timber line, the altitude where the oxygen is too thin for trees to grow, the more serious Doug's problems became. Finally, after his courage and determination were overcome by his biological need for air, we were forced to stop again. After a prayer and a priesthood blessing, it was decided that Doug would leave his pack and begin walking. I hiked as fast as I could to the top of the ascent, dropped my pack and returned to carry Doug's to the top of the hill. From there we regrouped and moved forward to our camping spot at Dollar Lake.<br /><br />That night, surrounded by my family in this beautiful place, we sang, told stories, and talked until one-by-one the kids and my wife retired to their sleeping bags. As is usually the case with me, I found myself sitting alone by a fire with an incredible sky full of stars and plenty of time to think. As I reflected on the day that had passed, I admit that a little pride set in as I mused at what a great leader I was. After all, during that day I had been presented with challenges of discouragement, exhaustion, fear, and even physical problems. In each case I had used my leadership toolkit to overcome the problems, and now, here we were. Not only that, but how awesome was it going to be to stand on top of Kings Peak with my loved ones. And how great was it going to be to send that picture out as our Christmas card to all my friends. That was going to be an accomplishment I would be proud of.<br /><br />Well, there's a funny thing about pride; as soon as we begin to be puffed up in our own superiority and accomplishment, God has a knack for teaching us a lesson. The next day He took full advantage of that opportunity and taught me lessons I will never forget.<br /><br />For a minute, I'm going to borrow from a talk by President Kim B. Clark, given on this campus in 2015.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;In his talk on disciple leadership he taught us that the purpose of a leader, and especially a Christ-centered, disciple leader is to chase away darkness. Disciple leaders are those who generate light and drive out darkness.<br /><br />Darkness takes many forms and enters our organizations through arrogance, deception, corruption, mediocrity, exploitation, waste, negativity, and other destructive behaviors. Light, on the other hand, also comes in many forms, and as we know Jesus Christ is the source of all good things. Positive behaviors that bring light include kindness, community, shared purpose, high standards, excellence, and love.<br /><br />Over the years, as I have had experiences like the one I am sharing with you today, and as I have thought about my personal successes and failures, I have taken the opportunity to evaluate the meaning of true Christ-centered leadership. I bear testimony that the characteristics of a true leader, a disciple leader, can only be discovered by learning of Him who led with perfect purpose, with perfect intentions, and with perfect vision. I testify that the only perfect leadership is Christ-centered leadership.</p>
<p>I would like to discuss six attributes of a Christ-centered leader. These attributes are:</p>
<p>First, let's talk about obedience. As we roused ourselves the next morning, we were excited to get moving. We were already behind schedule when we left, but I knew of a shortcut that would get us to the top quicker. As we arrived at the top of Gun Sight Pass, where a slight deviation would lead us to the shortcut, the spirit whispered, nay yelled at me, that it was not a good idea to take the shortcut. We obeyed and decided to take the longer trail considering that we could still make the top and get back down by midafternoon.<br /><br />In a familiar Primary song, we are taught about the eternal principle of obedience. The song is simply entitled "Baptism,"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;and recounts the story of Jesus' baptism by John the Baptist. "To fulfill the law, said Jesus, when the Baptist questioned why. And to enter with my Father in the Kingdom up on high" are the words of this song that emphasize the critical and eternal importance of obedience.<br /><br />Obedience is, and always will be the key to unlocking the powers of Heaven. It is a confused leader who seeks lasting power through breaking the rules of an organization or the violation of the Laws of Heaven. In Doctrine &amp; Covenants 130: 20-21 we read:<br /><br />"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated&mdash;And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated."<sup>4</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>As we obey, we are blessed, as we are blessed, we become more effective and we enable ourselves, and our teams, to accomplish incredible things.<br /><br />The next attribute is patience. As we descended the back part of the pass, and subsequently began to climb, the rough terrain began to take a toll on my family. Over and over we rested and restarted. I started feeling anxious about our slowed progress. As we proceeded, our pace reduced even more. I began to move past anxiety to genuine worry as we were already into the afternoon hours and were not yet close to the peak. In my mind, we simply needed to move faster, so I continued to push.<br /><br />It must have been difficult for Christ, at times, with His full understanding of the plan, to work with the apostles, who in the overall scheme of things were learning, much in the way a toddler learns to walk. The gospel was so new to them and although they were inspired and spiritual men, they occasionally required the correction of a loving leader.<br /><br />In Luke chapter 18<sup>5</sup>, we witness Christ's patience as His apostles attempted to protect Him by barring those desiring to bring their children to Him to be blessed. With love and forbearance, Christ corrected them and in so doing taught them eternal principles about the kingdom of God and instructed them that only the adoption of the attributes of these beloved and innocent children would qualify them to enter God's rest.<br /><br />Patient leaders know how to wait for their teams, and for themselves to learn, but more importantly they know how to nurture and teach to accelerate and amplify learning. They also labor to understand the Lord's way and the Lord's timeframe and recognize that the vision of man cannot outreach the vision of God. Sometimes we must be patient as God's plans rollforward. Finally, a truly patient leader has turned their life over to the Lord and has the enduring faith to withstand the seemingly urgent emergencies of the world while they wait for the much deeper rewards that will come.<br /><br />Humility is the next attribute. We arrived at the base of the Anderson Pass. This pass marks the final ascent to the peak, an ascent that is very difficult as there is no path to speak of. From this point on it is a steep and tough climb over huge boulders. After a series of climbs and breaks, I arrived at another resting point and took a moment to look over my flock. It didn't look good. It was already deep into the afternoon, and with the exception of my wife and two daughters, the crew was moving slowly. I was becoming more and more worried and I began to come to the realization that my goal to have all of these people on top of this peak was dwindling away. We gathered in a family council to make a decision that would ultimately require the sacrifice of my badge of honor.<br /><br />It became clear that getting all of us to the peak, was really not an option, so the question in front of us was whether or not we should split up to allow those still in good shape to make the peak while the others began the descent, or whether everyone would sacrifice the victory and descend together. During this council, I looked at our son Tim, then fourteen years old, and I saw the tears beginning to flow out from underneath his sunglasses. Tim has always had a tender heart and has enjoyed a special relationship with the Spirit. When I asked what was wrong, he replied, through his sobs, "we need to stay together." I was the experienced backpacker, he was just a child. In my confidence, I discounted his council.<br /><br />It is sometimes difficult to imagine what really happened during the Great Council in Heaven. Clearly, there was much discussion and debate about the principles that would govern our mortal lives, but in the end there was a declaration of the Father's will pertaining to His design of this, our second estate. Lucifer, looking to bring glory upon himself, brought forward another plan, saying, "send me and not one soul will be lost." I wonder sometimes how I responded upon hearing this plan, but I hope I was joyful when Jesus, our brother and the beloved Son of the Father came forward and said "Father, thy will be done, and glory be thine forever." I hope I recognized His humility and love for His Father. I want to believe that I was touched by this modest response by Him, who was greater than all, and that it was His submission to His Father's will that convinced me to follow Him.<br /><br />Christ-centered leadership cannot be based on pride, arrogance, or on bringing attention upon oneself. Humble leaders are teachable and always improving. They council with others, and listen to that council. Moreover, they trust those they council with and are not afraid to admit their own inadequacies and mistakes. It is only through selflessness and humility that one can become truly innovative. This happens by opening our minds to new ideas and concepts, even if they originate with someone else.<br /><br />Next, let's talk about wisdom. We decided that I would turn around and help those who could not make it and still leave enough time to hike back to our camp before dark. My wife and two daughters would continue on to the peak and immediately follow us down to the camp. Yes, we were disappointed to come that close and not be able to attain the goal. It was hard to watch my wife and daughters scurry up the rocks towards the peak.<br /><br />Anyway, down we went, and much to my worry, our pace had not sped up. In fact we were moving slower than ever. With time ticking away, I began to feel concerned and worried as I realized that there were no lights in any of the bags. After all, we had planned to be back at camp by midafternoon. I began to be even more worried as I arrived at the base of Gunsight Pass and looked back and saw, off in the distance, my wife, Jaime, and Maddie, following the wrong path, off into Painter Basin. This was a big problem, as it would quickly take them in the wrong direction to a very remote and unfamiliar territory with night quickly approaching.</p>
<p>At that moment, I began to question the decision to leave our flashlights at camp. I began to question our decision to split up. And I began to question how well I had prepared the team to navigate in the Uintas.<br /><br />Wisdom is the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment. The Pharisees, a religious party among the Jews, prided themselves on their knowledge of the law and their strict observance of that law. On many occasions these so called learned men conspired to entrap Jesus to discredit Him. They looked for opportunities to prove His lack of compliance and thereby disprove that He was the Son of God. In John chapter 8 we can read of one of these times.<br /><br />In this instance, a woman accused of committing adultery, was brought before Jesus at the temple where He had been teaching. I imagine the Pharisees thought they had come across the perfect situation to disrepute Jesus. I marvel at the wisdom of our Savior as He patiently contemplated the situation, and wisely sought inspiration. Only when He was ready to respond did He give the reply found in John chapter 8 verse 7.<br /><br />"So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her."<sup>6</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>One by one, the accusers contemplated Christ's words and, weighed down by their own consciences, relinquished their hold on the woman. As we know, Jesus lovingly taught the woman and sent her on her way.<br /><br />Christ-centered leaders pursue learning, and make good use of their knowledge, but through their experience, good judgment and the light of Christ, they seek after the spirit to make wise decisions.<br /><br />The next attribute is courage. After a quick prayer, I made a decision, to send the crew I was with up the pass and I turned around and began to sprint back across the expanse of the valley. Once I got to the other side of the valley, I could see my girls afar off, after all they were hiking quickly to catch up with us, only they were still on the wrong path. I tried desperately to yell and wave in hopes that they would see, but at that moment, I had a serious problem. On the one hand I had the crew who were exhausted and struggling headed up Gun Sight Pass. On the other hand, although they were in good shape, my girls were headed the wrong way.<br /><br />All the time, the day was turning into night. At that very poignant moment, all disappointment at not making the peak, and any other petty worry left me. I was completely helpless. The feelings of confidence and pride that I had enjoyed the night before were completely vacant.<br /><br />It was at this moment that I realized that our successful reunion would be entirely out of my hands and that I was dependent on the Lord. The prayer I offered was brief but intense as I asked for guidance. I poured everything I could into it, expressed my willingness to submit to God's will, and waited for an answer.<br /><br />I marvel as I think about the anguish our Savior went through as He took our sins and weaknesses upon Him. I'm not sure any of us, with our feeble earthly minds will be able to fully comprehend His pain as He atoned for each and every one of God's children, but we get a glimpse in Doctrine &amp; Covenants 19 verses 16-19:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit&mdash;and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink&mdash;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I'm not sure there is any passage of scripture with more emotion. I'm so grateful for this immeasurable gift as I have frequent need of the Atonement. I am also grateful for the incredible courage exhibited by Jesus. To know what was coming and to willingly accept it because it was right, and because it was the will of the Father, is the greatest show of courage in all of history.</p>
<p>Leaders, especially Christ-centered leaders must have courage. This is especially true in a world that is becoming more confused and wicked. We will be required to do difficult things and it will take courage to do them, but as we muster that courage, the blessings will begin to flow. Have the courage to say no, even when it will not be the popular answer. Have the courage to be wrong and admit your mistakes. Have the courage to assume a support role even when the credit might go to someone else. In the end, have the courage to ask, answer, and act upon the well know question: "What would Christ do?" An honest answer to this question will always lead you along the right path.</p>
<p>Finally, I'll talk about love. My answer came. It was to turn around and get back with the part of my family struggling to get up Gun Sight Pass. I was not in a place to question the Lord so I turned, wiped the tears from my eyes and again sprinted back across the valley and scurried, as fast as I could up the pass. I caught up with my kids near the top and discovered that things were not going so well. Everyone was exhausted and discouraged. To top it off, my oldest daughter had a severely sprained ankle.<br /><br />With determination, and after a prayer, asking the Lord to protect our family, we slowly but determinedly moved toward our camp. As we arrived, I was aware that the sun had gone down, darkness was creeping across the world, and the girls were still lost. I was terrified. After getting everyone settled, I grabbed a bag full of flashlights, enjoyed a brief drink of water, and headed back up the trail. I didn't know what to expect, but I knew I needed to go back. I was listening to the Lord at this point.<br /><br />As I hiked, I cried. I rethought the day and the decisions that lead us to this point. While I knew I was doing what the Lord was telling me now, I could see the things I had done wrong previously in that very long day and realized that the price of my mistakes might be catastrophic. By now, it was dark. The light was gone. I was very worried and offered another prayer.<br /><br />Although the path in front of me was illuminated by the light strapped to my forehead, there were three out there who were hiking in the dark. A few moments later as I hiked with all the energy I had left in my body, I saw the most beautiful sight I had ever seen. There they were, my wife and daughters, coming around the corner. I fell to my knees, exhausted and grateful. After a quick prayer of thanks, I ran to them and hugged them.<br /><br />Back at the camp, I sat, surrounded by those people who are most important to me. Each of us, through the trials of the day had all the worldly concerns and pride stripped away. Although my wife and two daughters had reached the peak, my goal was not accomplished. That didn't matter, for I had gained something more valuable. I learned lessons of critical importance. The worldlypride of boasting that my family reached the peak had been stripped away and replaced by a contentment that I cannot describe. Oh how I rejoiced as we sat there in love with one another and feeling the joy of the Lord.<br /><br />Have you ever really thought about the Last Supper? Have you ever closed your eyes and imagined being in the room on that fateful evening? As Jesus and the twelve came together to share the last meal they would share before Christ's death, I'm sure the room was full of emotion. During the course of the supper, Judas was identified as a betrayer, the sacrament was instituted, Jesus washed the feet of the apostles, and through it all, Christ humbly continued to teach.<br /><br />As the night was coming to a close it seems that Jesus was now ready to deliver the message that His words and actions had been eluding to all evening. With renewed energy, He looked to the eleven remaining apostles, addressing them as "Little children," and delivered the very poignant message found in John 13: 34-35:<br /><br />"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another."<sup>8</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>There it is. This was it. In the very last moments of his earthly life, Christ, with plainness and exactness, gave the eleven apostles the key. This time there was no parable to interpret to illustrate the point; it was simply out there; the commandment upon which all others might be based. This was, and is, the very foundation of Christ's Gospel. All His teachings, all His actions, all His miracles&mdash;all of it was based on an intense, incomprehensible love; a love for His Father and a love for His flock.</p>
<p>Now that He was leaving, He was ready to instruct the eleven, and us, on how to carry on His sacred work and mission. It is love that distinguishes a great leader from a mediocre leader. It is love for the organization, it is love for the mission, and it is love for the people, and it is a love for God and His gospel.</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, I close with this picture, taken halfway between Anderson Pass and Kings Peak, just after the difficult moment when we decided to split up and turn around. Originally, to me, this photo was a memorial to my disappointments of that day. Since, after understanding the lessons taught to me, it has become one of my favorite photos as it is a continual reminder that lasting success in this life, and in the life to come, can only be found by turning ourselves over to the will of our Eternal Father and by following the examples and teachings of His Son and our Redeemer, Jesus Christ.<br /><br />I express my love to you, to my Savior and to our Father and bear testimony of the truthfulness of His eternal gospel.<br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, what an honor to be here. I congratulate all of you, graduates of the Class of 2016. You have distinguished yourselves at BYU-Idaho by your work, your faith and your commitment. I recognize that you did not do this alone. Your parents, fellow students, professors, university administrators and even roommates who are here, and away, have been a part of your journey here at BYU-Idaho. Most of all, I hope you feel a sense of peace and accomplishment from your Father in Heaven for this achievement at an institution built upon "...the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God...."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> </sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I want you to think for a moment, "What does it feel like to be here at commencement?" What does the future look like for you?" And, "what are you going to do about it?" &nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with making a record. When you go home tonight, consider writing in your journal about this significant day in your life. How it looked, felt and motivated you to press forward. If you do not have a journal, now is a good time to begin one. You will look back at this day many times in your life and a record of your thoughts and tender feelings will add strength, perspective and resolve to the challenges you will face. I hope your account will include something about the people who have been here with you, pulling and pushing you along. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My thoughts this evening are based on just such a journal entry that was&mdash;in so many ways&mdash;a rite of passage, like yours today. This one was on that infamous hill in Church history called Rocky Ridge when the Willie Handcart Company was out in Wyoming facing desperate times in an early winter. The words come from John Chislett, and the message comes from his heart, sanctified in the worst of times.</p>
<p>Chislett, age 24&mdash;close in age to many of you&mdash;wrote: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A few days of bright freezing weather were succeeded by another snow storm. The day we crossed the Rocky Ridge it was snowing a little&mdash;the wind hard from the North West&mdash;and blowing so keenly that it almost pierced us through. We had to wrap ourselves closely in blankets, quilts, or whatever else we could get, to keep from freezing. Captain Willie still attended to the details of the company's travelling, and this day he appointed me to bring up the rear. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Chislett continues:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My duty was to stay behind everything and see that nobody was left along the road. I had to bury a man who had died in my hundred, and I finished doing so after the company had started. In about half an hour, I set out on foot alone to do my duty as rear-guard to the camp. The ascent of the ridge commenced soon after leaving camp, and I had not gone far up it before I overtook a cart that the folks could not pull through the snow, here about knee-deep. I helped them along, and we soon overtook another. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By all hands getting to one cart we could travel; so we moved one of the carts a few rods, and then went back and brought up the other. After moving in this way for a while, we overtook other carts at different points of the hill, until we had six carts, not one of which could be moved by the parties owning it. I put our collective strength to three carts at a time, took them a short distance, and then brought up the other three. Thus by travelling over the hill three times&mdash;twice forward and once back&mdash;I succeeded after hours of toil in bringing my little company to the summit.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you picture the scene? These were trail-weary pioneers, some in this very company were my own Moulton ancestors, wrapped in thin blankets to keep from freezing, and trudging in deep snow, exerting what little energy they had left to get to the top. I am sure it seemed insurmountable for them alone, however, Chislett came up from behind and added his strength and will to theirs and then they picked up others along the way. Putting their "collective strength to three carts at a time" they were able to make the climb and eventually arrive at the evening fires; fires stoked by the sheer faith of the Saints. They had little else. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you have in your youth recreated that trek experience out on a trail just to feel a small measure of what they felt as they followed the Lord's call to come to Zion. I doubt yours was in snow up to your knees and yet that push and pull up the hill was still a staggering feat. How did you make it? How did they make it? "By travelling over the hill three times&mdash;twice forward and once back."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The experience was truly an example of the second great commandment, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it. You have careers, families and adventures ahead of you, however, no one of them can be counted a success if you do not see that your fellow travelers get to the top of the hill. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That is a different perspective than the world would espouse. In our Father's kingdom&mdash;here on earth&mdash;we operate by different rules. The Lord laid out His expectations for us during His ministry. Remember the account of the man who asked the Savior, "what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>&nbsp;</sup>The Lord listed commandments to him ending with "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." <sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></sup> And the young man said, "All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> </sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> </sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The handcart pioneers had hardly any possessions left by the time they reached Rocky Ridge. They had consumed their food and thrown extra weight from their carts. They had nothing&mdash;except pioneers like John Chislett and an inner resolve to get to Zion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How does this apply to you&mdash;setting out as you are in 2016 with a degree in your hand and promise in every direction? Let me suggest a few lessons to be learned from Chislett's account that will serve you well in the years ahead. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First, press on. Press on no matter how hard it gets, no matter how deep the snow, how steep the climb; no matter how little you have left to keep going. Remember and rely upon the Lord's promise, "...be of good cheer, I have overcome the world."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>You may be at the back of the pack like John Chislett. Recognize the responsibility to not leave anyone behind. There will be many you encounter with broken hearts and broken dreams. Lift them, help them move forward, boost their confidence in their ability and renew their faith that the Lord is watching over them. He sent you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just recently I talked with hundreds of thousands of youth in 146 countries around the world in a Face-to-Face broadcast about the 2016 theme for Young Men and Young Women. The scripture theme comes from 2 Nephi: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pressing forward is a principle of righteousness in every dispensation. Let's look at the life of the Prophet Nephi as an example. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This scripture, "Press forward with a steadfastness in Christ"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a></sup> comes after Lehi's family has reached the Promised Land. Like any trek-crossing the plains for the pioneers or crossing the desert and ocean for Lehi and company, it was hard going to get there. His brothers scorned Nephi for thinking he could take on Laban. And what did Nephi say? "Nevertheless I went forth."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a></sup> In other words, he pressed on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You will have those who take issue with your determination to follow the will of the Lord. We see it all around us as attacks on religious freedom increase. Stay the course, brothers and sisters. Hold fast to the Lord's commandments&mdash;even in the face of challenges from unbelievers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi angered his brothers when he broke the steel bow he used to hunt for food. His brothers, at this point, had "hardened their hearts..., even unto complaining against the Lord their God."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a></sup> It was a pattern for them. Nephi made a bow out of wood, followed the directions of the pointers on the Liahona to the top the mountain, and there he slayed wild beasts. He pressed on. It may not have been just how he wanted it, a wood bow in place of a fine steel one, hunting alone with no one at his side; however, he pressed on. You will be asked at times to do the same. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi was commanded to build a ship and though his brothers scorned his effort, he was successful saying, "...If God had commanded me to do all things, I could do them. If he should command me that I should say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I should say it, it would be done."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> </sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember then that the family was out on the ship and the rebellious brothers tied him to the mast, making merry at first, and then found themselves unable to steer the ship in a "terrible tempest."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a></sup> When it looked finally like they would be lost in the depths of the sea the brothers loosed Nephi from his bindings. Said Nephi, "...I did praise [God] all the day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord...."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a></sup> He pressed on just as John Chislett did and he carried his brothers forward with him every time. Will you? &nbsp;</p>
<p>You too will have moments when the adversary will come after you. He will make things hard or sometimes worse, more alluring, than living the commandments of God. Do not be drawn off or discouraged. Do not blame the Lord for He has said, "...I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftnref17">[17]</a> </sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust Him. Trust Him to help you with the decision about an eternal companion, a family, a job and a home. Pray for guidance, make a decision, and then take it to the Lord for His confirming peace. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God....<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find yourself in mists of darkness, get down on your knees. Brigham Young used to teach about prayer, "Knees get down, I say; and down bend the knees."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a></sup> It's that simple. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I had such an experience at the end of my college years. I was offered a position to leave during my last year of school and take a job&mdash;the job I would have sought at the end of my schooling. Sister Rasband and I went to the Lord "not knowing beforehand the things [that we] should do."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Sound familiar? We felt prompted to take the job. It was the right decision for us though at the time, and many times since, I have wished I had that certificate of graduation you have in your hands today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord has a plan for each one of us and He will unfold that plan as we turn to Him in prayer, seek His guidance, act upon His promptings and press on. This, I know, brothers and sisters. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The second lesson: draw upon your strength and the strength of others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Enlist the help of those who know God's ways. It is not the easiest path, as Chislett would have told you, but it is a straight path and He has it marked well. As I testified in my General Conference message, listen to and follow your leaders, know they are there to help you just as Chislett was there for his 100 pioneers. Did those straggling up the hill at Rocky Ridge scoff at his call to join forces and pull together? Those who refused help, or refused to help died, frozen, on the hillside. But those who put their weight and efforts to pressing on together reached the summit and eventually the valley beyond. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Where do we see this in today's world? You are not out on mountainsides in the winter, but you know some of you are out on the Internet, out listening to those calling "lo here and lo there."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Whether it be antichurch blather or pornography, resolve today to set that pattern aside. You need your strength to withstand the buffetings that will continue to come at you and at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Why? Because, these are the last days and Satan is running out of time. He is throwing everything he has out there to catch the attention of God's children, to draw them off, to stymie their progress, to conflict their very souls. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Wrote one of the survivors of the ill-fated handcart companies, "Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="">[22]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>What of Laman and Lemuel? They kept questioning their father and their brother Nephi, never recognizing or nurturing the spiritual influences in their own lives. Let me suggest a couple of ways to blunt the adversary's attack on your spiritual strength. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to church every week and partake of the sacrament with a repentant and forgiving heart. Seek the power of the Atonement to strip away your follies so that you can sustain your strength. Encourage those close to you to do the same. You may have to do that time and again, as did John Chislett as he climbed back and forth on the mountain. Do not stop! Ask your questions&mdash;you have them, we all do&mdash;ask them of your parents, quorum leaders and Relief Society sisters who have more experience, knowledge, and spiritual strength. They are behind you, always there to assist. Ask them in your mind and heart while you read the scriptures and wait to be taught by the Spirit. Ask the Lord in prayer and be patient for the answer. Receive counsel from the leaders of the Church and follow them. I testify they are wise, divinely guided servants of the Lord and able to see farther&mdash;they can see the valley; trust them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your greatest strength is the Lord Jesus Christ. He has promised: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you...<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">[23]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...I will be on your right hand and on your left....<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title="">[24]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...I know my sheep, and they are numbered.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title="">[25]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[My] peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you...<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="">[26]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title="">[27]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The third lesson. Rescue those who are faltering along the way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>John Chislett wrote, "My duty was to stay behind everything and see that nobody was left along the road."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="">[28]</a></sup> In the Lord's words&mdash;"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">[29]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>What does that mean for us today? &nbsp;</p>
<p>It means being the Lord's disciples for a lifetime. It means reaching out to family members with a humble and contrite heart to heal a wound you may have inflicted on someone, or that may have been thrust at you. It means forgiving when you do not feel like you were at fault, choosing to lift someone's spirits rather than attack their weaknesses. It means to be loving and kind. We cannot afford as disciples of Jesus Christ, as we all are brothers and sisters, to be the reason someone steps away from the gospel. We cannot afford to walk by when someone is in need. We cannot demand our own justice when the Lord has said, "Blessed are the merciful..."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title="">[30]</a> </sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It means fellowshipping new converts and friendshipping those who have slipped away. How do you feel when you see a former friend or companion who has turned away from the Lord and His ways? What would John Chislett do? He would go back and help them pull the cart. He would go back again and again rallying support of others to get that soul to the top and back to the fire of the Lord. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hearing of the plight of the handcart pioneers stranded out in the winter blizzards, Brigham Young stood up at general conference and called for the members, "Go and bring in those people now on the plains."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title="">[31]</a></sup> These members, including my great-grandfather John Bennet Hawkins, had little to spare, but they loaded their wagons with blankets stripped from their beds, emptied food from their cupboards, meager a supply as it was, and headed up the canyon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be those times&mdash;many times&mdash;when you will be the answer to someone's prayer; you will be as the Lord says, "mine angels round about..., to bear [them] up."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title="">[32]</a></sup> But He adds this caveat: "...no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love...."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title="">[33]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>What does that mean to you? How do you show your love? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Chislett's duty "was to stay behind everything."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title="">[34]</a></sup> I wonder if staying behind is hard for anyone here? Standing behind is an interesting vantage point in contrast to the ones up front. It is also less visible to those who are watching. Do not be persuaded to believe that what matters most happens only in front of the cameras or in front of the crowd. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On that treacherous hillside, in the worst of weather, no one was looking for the one with squared shoulders or shiny buttons. Think how they felt when Chislett put his arm in theirs and pushed on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For the most part, these were families out on the trail. President Harold B. Lee, the eleventh president of the Church, said, "The most important of the Lord's work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title="">[35]</a> &nbsp;</sup> <sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>The world will tell you otherwise, that you are behind the curve if you are focusing your attention on what is happening in your home. Don't you believe it! The Lord has taught through His prophets, "The family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-commencement-winter-2016#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title="">[36]</a></sup> In the Lord's eyes, that is hardly the back of the pack. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the Lord is pleased with all of you today. He is pleased at the course you have set and that you are commencing into new fields of endeavor and new fields of influence. Most of all, He is pleased that you are His&mdash;righteous, faithful, and obedient. You are prepared to make a difference in a world that needs your strength that will admire your persistence in pressing on with your hearts filled with love. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As one of His servants, I leave my blessing with you today. I bless you that you will feel strength as you press on in the work of the Lord, as you cherish and lead your families, as you honor your mothers and fathers, as you help others who have fallen behind, and as you show gratitude to your Father in Heaven for all He has given you. He will continue to bless you and lead you as you turn to Him and trust Him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Take counsel and stand strong, shoulder to shoulder bearing testimony that Jesus Christ lives, that He loves us and that He leads us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of this I bear my solemn witness, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
<p>Elder Ronald A. Rasband was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on October 3, 2015. He had been serving as a member of the Presidency of the Seventy since 2005 and was serving as the senior president of the Presidency of the Seventy when called to the Twelve. Elder Rasband was named a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on 1 April 2000. He has served as a counselor in the Europe Central Area Presidency, president of the Utah Salt Lake City Area, executive director of the Temple Department; and has supervised the North America West, Northwest, and three Utah areas as a member of the Presidency of the Seventy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Rasband attended the University of Utah. In 1995, Utah Valley University awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Business and Commerce. In 1976 he joined Huntsman Container Company as sales representative, and in 1987, he was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer of Huntsman Chemical Corporation.</p>
<p>When he left Huntsman Chemical Corporation in 1996 to serve as a mission president in New York, he was also serving as a member of the Board of Directors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Rasband has held numerous Church callings, including full-time missionary in the Eastern States Mission (1970-1972), Temple Square missionary guide, bishop, and member of the Church's Sesquicentennial Committee. He presided over the New York, New York North Mission from 1996 to 1999.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Rasband was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1951. He married Melanie Twitchell in 1973. They are the parents of five children and have 24 grandchildren.</p>
<p><strong></strong>This is a great day in your lives. I feel honored and privileged to be a part of it. I chose this convocation because my own college background is in the business and communication field. You have worked hard to get here; you will work hard when you leave. Your family&mdash;spouse, parents, children, and siblings&mdash;are heralding this day of accomplishment in your life. Now you go forth to make a difference in a world that needs you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sitting in General Conference last Sunday, I had a prompting to change my message to you this evening. &nbsp; As we witness daily, we live in perilous times shown to prophets long ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2nd Timothy, the Apostle Paul prophesied of our day, saying, "This know also, that in the last day perilous times shall come."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""></a>Nephi also saw our time. He even saw into the condition of the hearts of the people as we read in 2nd Nephi:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, at that day shall he [the devil] rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And others will he pacify and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well&mdash;and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in our day of the Restoration, the Lord knowing the trials that would come, spoke to the Church as recorded in Doctrine and Covenants Section 1:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""></a>Perilous times. Anger and rage, cheateth, wo, calamity. These are sobering words being fulfilled right before our eyes.</p>
<p>The scriptures clearly outline ways to find refuge and renewal. From the Doctrine and Covenants Section 87, we read: "Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord come; for behold, it cometh quickly, saith the Lord."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""></a>And in Doctrine and Covenants Section 45: "But my disciples shall&nbsp;stand in holy places, and shall not be moved;"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""></a>I am struck by the emphasis on "stand in holy places." "Temples, homes, and chapels" are 'holy places.' The presence of the Spirit and our behavior there make them 'holy places,' 'sanctuaries from the world.'"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""></a>Today my message, prompted by the messages given in the Sunday sessions of General Conference, is centered on one of these holy places: the temple and the importance of temple worship, the power of the priesthood manifest in the ordinances of the temple. Know this: the temple will be both a defense and a place of refuge from the growing storms.</p>
<p>We have watched as the First Presidency has taken temples to the people all over the world. Just last Sunday President Monson announced four new temples in the following locations: Quito, Ecuador; Harare, Zimbabwe; Bel&eacute;m, Brazil; and Lima, Peru. &nbsp;</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson made a statement, what seems not so many years ago&mdash;before you were born&mdash;but listen to his words: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our predecessors have prophesied that temples <strong>will</strong> dot the landscape of North and South America, the isles of the Pacific, Europe, and elsewhere. If this redemptive work is to be done on the scale it must be, hundreds of temples will be needed.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time President Benson gave this message, there were nineteen temples operating in the Church, and Sister Rasband and I were just starting our own family. What a grand blessing it is to be living in this, our day, and to witness prophecy being fulfilled. We now have 150 operating temples throughout the world.</p>
<p>You have had a temple in your midst as you have attended this fine institution. President Thomas S. Monson dedicated the Rexburg Temple in 2008 as his first official act as prophet of the Lord's Church. In his dedicatory prayer, President Monson declared, "May Thy faithful Saints of this and future generations look to this temple as a sanctuary."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""></a>My question is this: Are you exercising that privilege? And, how can you build on your temple experiences when you leave?</p>
<p>What temples bring to families and individuals seeking to draw closer to the Lord Jesus Christ and our Father in Heaven, seeking peace in a fractured world, seeking comfort in times of trouble cannot be calculated. Let me give you a personal example. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was called to serve in the Area Presidency in England, my wife Melanie and I quickly realized what a sacrifice it would be for our children, particularly our son who was looking forward to his last year of high school and all the athletic competitions he would miss. Being uprooted is not easy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we arrived in England, we tried to help them feel at home, and at peace in a foreign land. Not being too successful, we decided to take the family to the Preston Temple to do baptisms for the dead. That was not something we had done in our busy life back home. Off we went to the north, spending the day at a temple that was, in some ways, foreign to us as well. The minute we walked into the temple baptistery everything changed. We knew the spirit. We knew we were home. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And then the miracle. Our son looked at us as we left that sacred place and commented how cool it had been. Then he said with sincerity, "Dad, why haven't we done this as a family before?" &nbsp;</p>
<p>I learned a lesson that day, brothers and sisters. The power of the temple had changed our perspectives. As a family the spirit of the temple had sanctified us. We had felt peace and joy that no football tournament or basketball game could bring. We had stepped away from the world and been spiritually lifted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Years ago, at the Logan Temple Cornerstone Ceremony in 1877, President George Q. Cannon said this: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Every foundation stone that is laid for a temple and every temple completed, lessens the power of Satan on the earth, and increases the power of God and Godliness, moves the heavens in mighty power in our behalf, invokes and calls down upon us the blessings of eternal Gods and those who reside in their presence.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> </sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certainly in a day and time like we live in, the importance of every temple built and dedicated to the Lord cannot be overstated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Prophets, seers, and revelators have promised us blessings, as we faithfully attend the temple. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our dear and beloved Prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, has made this promise and I testify to you it is true: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Come to the temple and place your burdens before the Lord and you will be filled with a new spirit and confidence in the future. Trust in the Lord and if you do, He will hold you and cradle you and lead you step-by-step along that pathway that leads to the Celestial Kingdom of God.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> </sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now a quote from my much-loved boyhood stake president, President James E. Faust: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We unavoidably stand in so many unholy places and are subjected to so much that is vulgar, profane, and destructive of the Spirit of the Lord that I encourage our Saints all over the world, wherever possible, to strive to stand more often in holy places. Our most holy places are our sacred temples. Within them is a feeling of sacred comfort.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I ask each of you, to what end and what purpose is all of this focus and emphasis on temples? How does it apply to you who are just looking at starting careers and families? You, who are worrying about jobs and homes and making a living? Let me point you to a passage of scripture in Doctrine and Covenants 52:14: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations&mdash;<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a></sup><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong></p>
<p>Temple worship is an important pattern for each of us as individuals, and as families. It is critical at every stage of your life. If you have yet to be sealed in the temple, continue to seek for that blessing. For those who have been sealed, honor that covenant with your heart, mind, and strength. Always be worthy to attend the temple. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The blessings of temple service are generational. We know as Latter-day Saints that temple and family history work is pertinent to our salvation. We refer to the feelings that we can have in seeking out our departed ancestors as having the Spirit of Elijah. &nbsp;</p>
<p>President James E. Faust, has said about this work: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Searching for our kindred dead isn't just a hobby. It is a fundamental responsibility for all members of the Church. We believe that life continues after death and that all will be resurrected. We believe that families may continue in the next life if they have kept the special covenants made in one of the sacred temples under the authority of God. We believe that our deceased ancestors can also be eternally united with their families when we make covenants in their behalf in the temples. Our deceased forebears may accept these covenants, if they choose to do so, in the spirit world.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I encourage you to spend time together searching for information about your ancestors on the Internet; you can do that at home with little children running about; then you can take those family members to the temple and do their temple work. They may not be able to speak to you directly like my son did to me, "Why haven't we done this before," but you may feel them with you, and their gratitude will be without words.</p>
<p>The First Presidency has issued as an invitation to all the members of the Church: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Where time and circumstances permit, members are encouraged to replace some leisure activities with temple service. All of the ordinances which take place in the house of the Lord become expressions of our belief in that fundamental and basic doctrine of the immortality of the human soul. As we redouble our efforts and our faithfulness in going to the temple, the Lord will bless us.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>As we consider establishing righteous patterns in our lives, it would be well to remember this admonition from the First Presidency.</p>
<p>The statement on the outside facade of every temple reads: "Holiness to the Lord, The House of the Lord." I testify that all of the temples of the Lord are His sanctuaries here upon the earth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>President Monson has taught: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As we go to the holy house, as we remember the covenants we make therein, we will be able to bear every trial and overcome each temptation. The temple provides purpose for our lives. It brings peace to our souls&mdash;not the peace provided by men but the peace promised by the Son of God when He said, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-ronald-a-rasband-convocation-winter-2016#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus Christ lives. This is His Church. This service in temples is rolling forward throughout the earth as prophets throughout the ages have seen in vision and prophecy to bless the lives of the Latter-day Saints, and carry out the work of redeeming the dead. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that President Thomas S. Monson is God's prophet upon the earth today and holds the sealing power of God; the same authority that was given to Joseph Smith by the Prophet Elijah in the Kirtland Temple. It is by that authority that new, eternal families are created, and sealed together for time and all eternity; so unlike that which is done out in the world relative to the divine institution of marriage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I leave my testimony and reaffirm these prophetic blessings to you today, in the Name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Commissioner of Education</p>
<p>Elder Kim B. Clark was sustained as a General Authority Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 4, 2015. At the time of his call he had been serving as the president of Brigham Young University-Idaho since 2005. He served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy, Idaho Area, from 2007 to 2014. He is currently serving as the Church Commissioner of Education.<br /><br />Elder Clark received a bachelor of arts, a master of arts, and a PhD, all in economics, from Harvard University. He became a faculty member at the Harvard Business School in 1978 and was named dean of that school in 1995. He served in that capacity until the summer of 2005, when he was named the president of Brigham Young University-Idaho.<br /><br />Elder Clark has served in a number of Church callings, including full-time missionary in the South German Mission, elders quorum president, ward executive secretary, counselor in a bishopric, bishop, high councilor, and counselor in a stake mission presidency.<br /><br />Kim Bryce Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on March 20, 1949. He married Sue Lorraine Hunt in June 1971. They are the parents of seven children.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>It's a joy for Sister Clark and me to be here with you on this very special day. We extend to you our love. <br /><br /> I want to share with you this evening something my father taught me. I hope it will be helpful to you as you head out on this next phase of your lives. My dad was a real cowboy. He grew up in southern Utah riding the range, breaking horses. He loved horses, and he loved to ride. There is a saying he taught us that captures something about the land he loved and something about the gospel that was such an important part of his life. My dad was a wonderful man and a wonderful disciple of the Savior. His favorite saying carries beautiful and profound advice. It is "ride the high country."&nbsp; <br /><br />My dad knew that sometimes we ride in the shadows and canyons of life. Adversity, whether because of a wrong turn we have made or because of things that happen to us, comes into every life. But the canyons and the shadows need not define our lives. We do not have to ride there all the time. Because of Heavenly Father's great plan of happiness and because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can ride up out of the shadows and the canyons into the high country where heaven is close, where the majesty of God's creations is before us, where the light is intensely bright, where the sky is deep and blue, and where it seems we can ride forever with love, peace, and joy in our hearts. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The message of this saying is, set your sights high. Set your heart on exaltation and eternal life with your eternal family in the kingdom of our Father. Build your life on the Lord Jesus Christ and His glorious gospel. Live your life with an eternal perspective. Ride the high country. <br /><br />Our family has taken this counsel to heart. We have made our family motto "Ride the high country together forever." <br /><br />I will give you a key to riding the high country. It is found in Isaiah, chapter 58, verses 13 and 14: <br /><br />If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath,&nbsp;from<em> </em>doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the&nbsp;sabbath&nbsp;a delight, the holy of the&nbsp;Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking&nbsp;thine<em> </em>own&nbsp;words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the&nbsp;Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the&nbsp;high places&nbsp;of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;hath spoken&nbsp;it<em>.</em><sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-kim-b-clark-commencement-winter-2016#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the key: If you will keep the Sabbath day holy, participate in the ordinance of the sacrament every week, make and renew your covenants with the Lord in that sacred ordinance, and then keep them, you will build your life on the rock that is the Lord Jesus Christ. The Sabbath day will be a delight, and you will delight yourself in the Lord. <br /><br />If you do these things, the Lord gives you this additional promise: "I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-kim-b-clark-commencement-winter-2016#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a></sup> In scriptural language the high places of the earth are symbolic of the temples of the Lord, and the heritage of Jacob is the Abrahamic covenant. <br /><br />Keeping the Sabbath day holy will help you develop greater faith in our Heavenly Father and in His Son, Jesus Christ. You will be drawn to the temple of the Lord and the great Abrahamic blessings we receive in the ordinances of salvation administered there. You will go, and you will receive those blessings. <br /><br />You are the seed of Abraham. You were born to ride the high country and to help others ride there with you. This is your great calling--to be a true, witness-bearing disciple of Jesus Christ, a trusted servant of the Lord, and a mother or father, a wife or husband in an eternal family. <br /><br />This is your calling. This is your destiny. This is who you are. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Clark G. Gilbert became the 16th&nbsp;president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in April 2015.<br /><br />President Gilbert brings a range of academic and professional experiences to his assignment in Rexburg. Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho in 2015, President Gilbert served as CEO of Deseret News Publishing Company and Deseret Digital Media. He also served as an associate academic vice president at BYU-Idaho, overseeing online learning and the Pathway program. As a deeply committed teacher, President Gilbert had administrative responsibility for the Learning Model at BYU-Idaho. Prior to coming to Rexburg, he was a professor of entrepreneurial management at the Harvard Business School where he taught and studied in the field of organizational innovation.</p>
<p>President Gilbert graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor's degree in International Relations. He earned a master's degree in East Asian Studies from Stanford University and a doctorate degree in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School.</p>
<p>President Gilbert has served in multiple ecclesiastical roles, including counselor in a stake presidency, bishop, counselor in a bishopric, Young Men's president, Gospel Doctrine teacher, and Scoutmaster. He currently serves as a Sunday School teacher with his wife, Christine.</p>
<p>President Gilbert was born in California and raised in Arizona. He and his wife, Christine, are the parents of eight children.</p>
<p>Earlier this week I visited with two college friends&mdash;men I loved and admired so much through memorable experiences from my younger days. Time and circumstance had treated both of them very differently. One of them was visiting us with his son who was preparing to start at BYU-Idaho in the fall. This friend had served well in the Church, remained faithful to his covenants, and, with his wife, had created a beautiful and loving family. Life had not always been easy, and they had struggled at times with work and other life challenges. But he and his family were happy, and our reunion was a joyous one. The other visit was on the phone. This was a friend who had left the Church, lost his marriage and relationship with his children, but was now working his way back to the faith. His challenges were tied to so many previous decisions. He had, in fact, been quite successful financially, but he was now reaching out for friendship and support on his difficult path back to the Church.<br /><br /> As each of you leave BYU-Idaho today, you will undoubtedly face a wide range of circumstances throughout your lives. For some of you, things will appear to come more easily&mdash;jobs, family, and other responsibilities will seem to flow seamlessly into your life. For others, life will feel more difficult. Those challenges may come through physical events&mdash;accidents, illness, or even the pre-mature death of loved ones. Other challenges may come from the poor choices of others that will nevertheless have significant repercussions in your own life. Regardless of the situation, you will not be able to choose all of the circumstances you will face; but you can choose the way you will respond to them.</p>
<p>Renowned author and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl once declared that "between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom."<sup><a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-commencement-winter-2016#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> </sup></p>
<p>As we leave today, I cannot predict the range of life circumstances each of you will face; but I can tell you that your ability to choose your response wisely will always be a stewardship you will need to own. As we are taught in Doctrine and Covenants 58:27-28:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.<sup><a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-commencement-winter-2016#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Several years ago I joined my parents on a walk where I listened to them reflect on the life choices of so many of their college friends. It was compelling to hear their realization that it was not the careers or wealth or even life situations that had brought happiness to their college friends. Instead, it was their ability to stay close to the gospel and to their families.</p>
<p>The personal observation of my parents is echoed more formally in the research of American scholar Arthur Brooks in his writing on happiness in America. It turns out that across a range of data, people who are happy over long periods of time are more likely to engage with their faith, be committed to their family, give back to their communities, and value&nbsp;work.<sup><a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-commencement-winter-2016#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> </sup></p>
<p>Of course, each of these life choices come as fruits of the gospel when we follow our Savior Jesus Christ. The mission of BYU-Idaho "is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities."<sup><a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-commencement-winter-2016#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a></sup> As we depart today, it is my prayer that you will make choices that will lead to your greatest happiness. In doing so, I promise you that you will not only find the happiness of living the gospel, but you will make a difference in the lives of those you love and serve. I leave these thoughts and this invitation with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Sister Gilbert is a native of Provo, Utah.&nbsp; She graduated from Brigham Young University in Family Science and taught elementary school before becoming a full-time homemaker.<br /><br />Sister Gilbert has served in multiple ecclesiastical roles, including Primary president, seminary teacher, and Gospel Doctrine instructor.<br /><br />She and her husband, Clark, were married as they graduated from BYU. They are the parents of eight children, ages two to nineteen.&nbsp; Sister Gilbert has a love for learning, a passion for her family, and a commitment to the gospel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Winters in New England can be harsh. I learned this firsthand during the years we held early morning seminary in the basement of our Boston home. I spent many snowy, cold mornings clearing the path from our driveway to the door that led to our seminary room entrance. While clearing this path, I would think about our students and the challenges they faced. I thought of Mike being raised by a single mother and Jill staying strong while many of her family members had strayed from the Church. With every shovel of snow, my heart desired to carve out a path and help them as much as I could. I wanted to make it as easy as possible for them to safely walk down the path and into our warm seminary room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, I had an impression that I should take a treat to each of them at their schools. By the time I arrived at the first high school, it was lunchtime. The halls were lined with hundreds of teenagers shouting and laughing as they ate lunch. I felt out of place as cliques of teenagers suspiciously looked me over. I remembered having similar feelings of being out of place on my first day of high school. Is this how my seminary students felt each day as they entered the doors of their high school? As I delivered my treats that day, I realized that I didn't have to worry about lessons or games or special breakfasts to help my seminary students. What they needed most from me was to simply feel loved as I sent them out the door each day for school.</p>
<p>As the Savior spoke to His disciples of the last days, He taught: "And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold."[1] Clearing a path through the cold winters of life will be increasingly difficult in the last days unless we look to the Savior for help.</p>
<p>Clearing the pathway with love doesn't always come naturally in all situations, and it isn't always easy for everyone. I have found that children are wonderful examples of reaching out with simple, Christlike love. One of the great joys of motherhood is when I see one of our children show love in small and simple ways such as a smile, hug, compliment, word of encouragement, or handwritten note left on a pillow or a mirror. Our daughter wrote on our bathroom mirror the other night expressing her love to her parents. The note read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><br /> "Dear Clark, &nbsp; I love you Dad! I hope you love me, too. Can you do me a favor? If so, please tell Mom that she is the best wife in the world and that you love her more than anything in the universe. I love you. &nbsp; Your favorite daughter, Emma" &nbsp;</p>
<p>This note actually came at the perfect time for me. I woke up with a little cloud of discouragement hanging over my head and just didn't feel like I was living up to the mother or wife that I was trying to be. Seeing this note brightened my outlook. I was overwhelmed by this simple act of love that my daughter showed to me. I was humbled as I recognized that President Gilbert had done exactly what Emma had asked by building and encouraging me the night before. We can learn from such spontaneous expressions of love and strive to implement some of these same practices into our daily lives. I know BYU-Idaho is a great place to develop the attributes of showing love, empathy, and kindness as you interact with roommates, ward members, classmates, friends, and teachers. This, in turn, will be a blessing for future leadership in your homes, the Church, and the communities where you serve.</p>
<p>We must look to the Savior's example of clearing the path with love. The Savior has walked every snowy, icy path imaginable. He knows that life can be harsh and doesn't expect us to walk alone. That is why we have each other and why we need to help one another in small and simple ways. As we put the Savior first in our lives, He will help us to know how we can clear the path with love. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p></p>
<p>Clark G. Gilbert became the 16<sup>th</sup> president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in April 2015.</p>
<p>President Gilbert brings a range of academic and professional experiences to his assignment in Rexburg. Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho in 2015, President Gilbert served as CEO of Deseret News Publishing Company and Deseret Digital Media. He also served as an associate academic vice president at BYU-Idaho, overseeing online learning and the Pathway program. As a deeply committed teacher, President Gilbert had administrative responsibility for the Learning Model at BYU-Idaho. Prior to coming to Rexburg, he was a professor of entrepreneurial management at the Harvard Business School where he taught and studied in the field of organizational innovation.</p>
<p>President Gilbert graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor's degree in International Relations. He earned a master's degree in East Asian Studies from Stanford University and a doctorate degree in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School.</p>
<p>President Gilbert has served in multiple ecclesiastical roles, including counselor in a stake presidency, bishop, counselor in a bishopric, Young Men's president, Gospel Doctrine teacher, and Scoutmaster. He currently serves as a Sunday School teacher with his wife, Christine.</p>
<p>President Gilbert was born in California and raised in Arizona. He and his wife, Christine, are the parents of eight children.</p>
<p>Sister Gilbert's background is also in education, having taught in elementary schools in California and in the Seminary program of the Church Educational System. She graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor's degree in Family Sciences and Human Development. Sister Gilbert was born in Indiana and raised in Utah. She has also held various ecclesiastical roles in the Church, including Primary president and Gospel Doctrine teacher.</p>
<p>I would like to start today's devotional with one of my most frightening experiences from high school. I grew up in an area where members of the Church were quite visible, but also clearly in the minority. As a high school senior, I was invited to participate in a dating game at a pep rally before our entire high school. Here is a picture of that crowd gathered in the high school gym.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="High school assembly" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring 2016/Devotional Graphics/Devo-pic-1_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />I so wanted to be accepted and thought highly of by my high school peers. As part of this activity, I was one of three young men who were asked a series of dating questions. Based on our responses, a young woman would then choose one of us to go on a Valentine's date. What started for me as a fun activity turned to panic as I realized that all of the questions they were asking had been designed to make fun of my choices as a member of the Church. As I stared into that crowd, I realized that they were mocking me for commitments to the Word of Wisdom, the law of chastity, and other values we cherish as members of the Church. In fact, at one point when they asked each of us about our taste in music, I decided I would play along with the joke by responding that my favorite song was, "I am a Child of God." I thought I was quite clever until they asked me to sing it. So, I may be the only teenager to ever sing a primary hymn in front of his entire high school class.<br /><br /> The gap between the Church and the world will only continue to widen. In the October 2015 general conference, President Thomas S. Monson declared:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">..<em>.[A]s the world moves further and further away from the principles and guidelines given to us by a loving Heavenly Father, we will stand out from the crowd because we are different. We will stand out because we dress modestly. We will be different because we do not use profanity... We will be different because we avoid off-color humor and degrading remarks. We will be different as we decide not to fill our minds with media choices that are base and demeaning... We will certainly stand out as we make choices regarding morality... Those things which make us different from most of the world also provide us with that light and that spirit which will shine in an increasingly dark world.<sup>[1] </sup></em><br /><br /></p>
<p>As we progress through life, each of us will have the opportunity to stand up for truth and light. For some of us, that will come in very public settings like the one I described in front of my high school. For others, the setting may not be so public; but it may be just as difficult with even more dire consequences around family, work, and even personal friendships. In all of these settings, we will need to learn what it means to stand as a disciple in the last days.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Last Days</span></p>
<p>Past prophets foresaw our time and knew of the challenges that we would face. Paul described this season when he foretold:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. <br /><br />For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, &nbsp; Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, </em><em>despisers of those that are good</em>.<sup>[2]</sup> <br clear="all" /></p>
<p>Nephi also spoke of this same antipathy toward good in the last days:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger <em>against that which is good</em>.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
<p>In fact, it was this same animosity towards good that Lehi saw in his dream that led those in the great and spacious building to mock those who had chosen the path toward the fruit of the tree of life:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth. <br /><br /> &nbsp; And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
<p>I love Greg Olsen's depiction of this scene.</p>
<p><img alt="Tree of Life" height="218" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring 2016/Devotional Graphics/Devo-pic-2_400x218.jpg" width="400" /></p>
<p>You can see the path to the fruit of the tree of life. It is marked clearly by the rod of iron. You can also see the crowds in the great and spacious building pointing at those on the path. And yet, for all their mockery, no one in the great and spacious building had access to the joy that came with the fruit of the tree of life. No one in that dark building could realize the blessings of following the true path to the light. They could only mock and despise others for choosing the good that they themselves had failed to realize.<br /><br /> This exchange reminds me of the courage that it takes to defy the crowd. Occasionally, I will hear someone complain that at BYU-Idaho there are so many people with the same values that you have to work hard to be different. Those who make such a claim miss the bigger picture. First, they fail to recognize that our graduates come from and will live in communities where Church members are the minority. We know from our alumni records that in the future most of you will live in places where members of the Church are not part of the dominant faith. It is but for a short reprieve that many are gathered here in the strength of the Church. Second, even here in Rexburg we swim in a current of social media and other entertainment sources where standing for good will always take courage. There is no such thing as a closed community in today's media environment.</p>
<p>This reality made me think of the following candid camera clip where a group of staff conspired to make people conform to norms that they otherwise knew were wrong.<sup>[5]</sup><br /><br /><a class="extLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgRoiTWkBHU" title="Youtube" target="_blank"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgRoiTWkBHU</a></p>
<p>The world will increasingly ask you to follow the crowd, to turn the wrong direction in the elevator, and to do what you know to be wrong. So when others conspire against our very efforts to be good, we should simply smile and continue facing the front of the elevator with confidence. We should not be afraid or discouraged. Rather, we should take heart to know that prophets long ago foresaw this day and have prepared us to stand apart from the crowd. As President Monson warned us in this last general conference:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">May we maintain the courage to defy the consensus. May we ever choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong.<sup>[6]</sup><br /><br /></p>
<p>As we work as a university community to stand as disciples in the last days, I would like to suggest five characteristics that will help us defy the crowd and stand for good.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow the Prophet</span></p>
<p>The first pattern of those who stand as disciples in the last days is to follow the prophet. I remember 15 years ago sitting in general conference and listening to President Gordon B. Hinckley warn the Church to get out of debt. President Hinckley stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am suggesting that the time has come to get our houses in order. <br /><br />So many of our people are living on the very edge of their incomes. In fact, some are living on borrowings. &nbsp; ...There is a portent of stormy weather ahead to which we had better give heed.<sup>[7]</sup></p>
<p>This counsel was repeated several times in the following years. Many of the Saints gave heed to this prophetic warning, cut back their budgets, and reduced their debt. But years later as I observed dozens of homes in our neighborhood in foreclosure, I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if more members of the Church had followed President Hinckley's counsel.<br /><br /> Today, President Monson is not only calling us to defy the crowd and stand for that which is good, he has taught us to help rescue those in need,<sup>[8]</sup> to realize that "decisions determine destiny,"<sup>[9]</sup> and to seek the temple as a place of refuge.<sup>[10]</sup> These are not just good thoughts from a loving man. These are the Lord's messages to us through a prophet for our time, in our day. They are important, not only in their substance but in their timing. Disciples in the last days will need to listen to and follow the prophet of God.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strengthen the Family</span></p>
<p>Those who have watched President Monson and the other Apostles will recognize another recurring message for our day - that of strengthening and defending the family. Disciples in the last days will need to stand up for and strengthen the family, both in society and in their own homes. The following are messages from the Brethren that speak to the importance of the family.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">President Thomas S. Monson</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;The family must hold its preeminent place in our way of life because it's the only possible base upon which a society of responsible human beings has ever found it practicable to build for the future and maintain the values they cherish in the present.<sup>[11]</sup> <sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elder D. Todd Christofferson</span> &nbsp; The social science case for marriage and for families headed by a married man and woman is compelling. And so "we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets." But our claims for the role of marriage and family rest not on social science but on the truth that they are God's creation."<sup>[12]</sup> <sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elder L. Tom Perry</span> &nbsp; We also believe that strong traditional families are not only the basic units of a stable society, a stable economy, and a stable culture of values-but that they are also the basic units of eternity and of the kingdom and government of God.<sup>[13]<br /></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elder Dallin H. Oaks</span> &nbsp; Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their children. . . . Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, and to teach them to love and serve one another.<sup>[14]<br /></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">President Russell M. Nelson</span> &nbsp; Latter-day Saints proclaim that "marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children."<sup>[15]</sup></p>
<p>Do you see the pattern?</p>
<p>We live in a season where the family is under attack. In these latter-days, families are increasingly not forming. Those that do form are dissolving at increasing rates. These decisions are leaving a growing number of children in homes without a mother and a father, creating dramatic consequences for society.<sup>[16]</sup> Many of you listening today have come from homes where parents were not present or were not committed to your family. Even as you honor your parents in your love and concern for them personally, you will need to break that pattern in your own marriage and future parental roles. I hope you recognize the commitment we make at this university with the Eternal Marriage course that every student takes at BYU-Idaho. Sister Gilbert and I participate in that course each semester and feel like it is one of the more important investments we make at this university. I hope you also see the focus Sister Gilbert and I place on our own family. I want each student at this university to know that with all of my responsibilities, there are still non-negotiable times for our family.</p>
<p>I learned this lesson as a young missionary. Over 25 years ago, this amazing couple and their family swept into the lives of the Japan Kobe missionaries.</p>
<p><img alt="Gilberts and Mission President" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring 2016/Devotional Graphics/Devo-pic-3_275x200.jpg" width="275" /></p>
<p>I learned many things from President and Sister Matsumori, but perhaps one of the most profound was the importance of family. I observed this poignantly one night walking up to the mission home only to find the curtains to their family room closed. As open and inviting as they were to all of us in the mission, this was a signal that, on that evening, family came first. One of their lasting legacies in my life will be the gift of teaching me how to prioritize family commitment, even in the presence of important Church and professional assignments. In the last days, not only will you need to stand for the societal and public needs of the family, you will need to make your own family a priority and form a lasting, personal commitment to the principles in the family proclamation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Act and Not Be Acted Upon</span></p>
<p>The next characteristic of a disciple in the last days is tied to our use of agency. I can't imagine that when earlier prophets saw our day, they didn't see the challenges created by media. You live in a media-laden world where your values are being attacked and where marketers and entertainers will play on your insecurities and other weaknesses to help sell their products. The technique used by so many of these agencies is to find what the crowd thinks is "cool" and push young people toward those products. Several years ago, PBS Frontline did a documentary on this marketing approach.<sup>[17]</sup></p>
<p><a class="extLink" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/view/" title="PBS">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/view</a></p>
<p>Notice how these marketers deploy what they call "cool hunters" to find people who are "forward thinking," "leaders in their group," and "ahead of the pack."<sup>[18]</sup> Here is the individual they identified to study in their focus groups.</p>
<p><img alt="A person the world thinks is cool" height="400" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring 2016/Devotional Graphics/Devo_pic_4_345x400.jpg" width="345" /></p>
<p>The next time you feel the pull of the crowd, I hope you'll think back on this guy and be far less attracted to the call to be "cool." I hope that each of you will realize that entire industries have been built up to market to and play on your tendency to be pulled by the crowd. And it's not just in advertising. Some of the science of audience engagement and media addiction show up in the entertainment industry as well. They result in binge watching on Netflix, click-through rates on websites, and, of course, pornography addiction on the Internet.<sup>[19]</sup> Remarkably, as powerful as these media companies are and for all of the money they invest, you are facing an additional media source that is unique to your generation. While social media offers opportunities to be a source of light to the world, it can also distract and even pull you down paths you should not go.<sup>[20]</sup></p>
<p>In the last days, disciples of Jesus Christ will need to act independently of all these powerful forces. Students, be agents unto yourselves. Act and do not be acted upon.<sup>[21]</sup> The power is in you, and you must choose who you will become and not hand your brain and your heart over to Netflix, Instagram, Snapchat, or the Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Show Kindness and Love</span></p>
<p>Sister Gilbert earlier shared a scripture in Matthew that described how love would wax cold in the last days.<sup>[22]</sup> In this season where so many are focused on self and conspire against good, it will be critical that the Lord's disciples remain kind and show forth love. To paraphrase one of our Church leaders, no one is going to heaven who isn't nice.<sup>[23]</sup> Well, I have news for all of you. Being nice to people who are not kind back, people who may even attack the very values you hold most dearly, is not easy. I reflect often on the story of Teancum in his battles with Ammoron. Now to be clear, Teancum is one of my heroes and is someone who stood for truth and battled against the armies of evil. And still, I can't help but wonder whether his growing anger clouded some of his attacks toward the end of his life. In Alma 62, we read that Teancum was "<em>exceedingly</em> <em>angry</em> with Ammoron."<sup>[24]</sup> And in the following verse again we read, "And it came to pass that Teancum <em>in his anger</em> did go forth into the camp of the Lamanites." In the last days, we will continue to be called upon to battle for what is right. But even as we stand with conviction for what we believe, we are not absolved from the responsibility to show forth love and kindness to others.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apply the Atonement</span></p>
<p>The last characteristic of those who stand as disciples in the last days is tied to repentance and the Atonement. In a world that fights so deliberately against good, you will not always emerge unscathed. You will then have to decide that it is better to repent than to stay in a pattern of sin. Now, the world will want you to feel justified in committing a little sin. In the last days,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God - he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, ...there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.<sup>[25]</sup></p>
<p>To the students of BYU-Idaho, please know that such doctrine is a lie; it is a justification for sin you will hear the rest of your lives. The consequences of sin are real, and we will be held accountable for our decisions, regardless of the rationalization and justifications of the world. The adversary will lie to us on our way to committing sin; he will lie to us on our way of getting out of sin. If he can't get us to rationalize our misdeeds, he will try to make us feel so lost that we lose hope in our path back. As disciples in the last days, you will need to believe in the power of the Atonement, repent when you make mistakes, and invite the forgiving power of Christ into your life.</p>
<p>I close with a statement from Elder Kim B. Clark:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In these perilous times, the Lord's prophet on the earth, President Thomas S. Monson, has called us to...stand for truth with courage... Whatever level of spirituality or faith or obedience we now have, it will not be sufficient for the work that lies ahead.<sup>[26]</sup></p>
<p>I'd like to express my confidence in you as the hope and future of this great Church. These are perilous times, and the gap between the world and the Church will only increase. And yet, we can stand with confidence as disciples in the last days. To do this, we must follow the prophet, strengthen our families, act and not be acted upon, show kindness and love, and apply the Atonement. I want you to know that I have a testimony that God is watching over His people and His Church in these last days. Through the Savior we can change and become who God wants us to become. I invite each of you to stand as disciples in these last days. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>University Services Managing Director</p>
<p>Eric Conrad currently serves as the Managing Director of University Services. He graduated from BYU's college of Engineering in Facilities Management with a minor in business. He is currently enrolled in the last semester of his master's program.<br /><br /> &nbsp; The first part of his professional career was spent working in corporate America during which time he held senior management positions at three Fortune 500 companies including: AT&amp;T as Director of Facilities, Aimco as Senior Vice President, and CB Richard Ellis as Managing Director, which involved overseeing the facilities management of 3,100 banks in 42 states. It was during his time at CB Richard Ellis that he decided to move his family from Seattle to Rexburg where they have lived for the last 9 years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Brother Conrad has seven children and two grandchildren.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p>I appreciate that we sang "Have I Done Any Good in the World Today" for the opening hymn as it sets the tone for my talk. The title of my talk is "Heavenly Father, what am I to learn?"</p>
<p>In 1992 I was attending BYU. I loved it there. I knew that BYU, just like BYU-Idaho for many of you, would allow me to build that sure foundation spoken of in Helaman 5:12. As a disciple preparation center, BYU-Idaho is teaching you more than secular knowledge. You are being taught how to strengthen and build your testimony, how to love others, how to serve, how to become a better member of society. In short, a church education is education of the heart, mind, and spirit. So, how can you use your time here at BYU-Idaho to build a foundation that can weather any storm? One way, is by learning from those who have gone before and taking in stride all challenges that come to us and asking, "Heavenly Father, what am I to learn?" Let me share with you today three life experiences that have made me stronger. By sharing these with you, I hope to strengthen you when storms come upon you in your life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example 1: It was the summer of 1992 that I met, fell in love with, and married my eternal sweetheart, Diane Morehead. She was in my family home evening group. Smart, funny, pretty, a returned missionary, and she loved the Lord more than anyone I had ever met. I knew from the moment I met her that this was the girl for me. As we began to discuss the possibility of marriage, Diane said we needed to talk. She invited me over for dinner at her apartment, made me a wonderful dinner, and at the end of dinner said, "There is something I need to tell you before our relationship goes any further." I thought to myself, here it goes, the great break up speech and she just wants to be "friends." Diane went on to tell me that she had multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease. Twenty-five years ago there were limited drug treatments and not much was known about MS. She explained to me that even though she was perfectly healthy now, there was a possibility that someday she would become crippled and could even die prematurely.</p>
<p>So, there I sat with my entire life ahead of me. Did I truly believe in eternal marriage? If yes, marry Diane and all will work out in God's time. If no, don't marry Diane. As I was praying about what to do, an image came to my head. Whether I had seen it or not before in a church lesson I do not know, but it looked like this: my 80 or so years of life was really just this small dot on this long spectrum where the line has no beginning or end. The answer to my prayers was if I believed in eternal marriage then we could do this. I said to myself, "Surely I would have at least 10 good years of marriage before Diane's health started to deteriorate, I can do this."</p>
<p>So, we continued dating and were married in the Ogden Utah Temple. Ten days after our marriage, Diane's first visible MS symptoms arrived. While we were walking up the stairs from lower campus to upper campus at BYU, her leg started to drag. What? I must admit I started to freak out a little. Ten days into marriage? I was hoping for 10 years, not 10 days. I pled with the Lord, a little more time than this where she can be healthy, but this was not the answer. In Alma 26:27 we learn that we should "bear with patience thine afflictions," and in Alma 36:3 we learn that those that "put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials."</p>
<p>As I reflected further on the answer I received before we were married, I remembered that marriage is eternal, that it can last forever, but God must be in the middle. So, I continued onward, what other choice did I have? Quit? Give up? Get divorced? I had made a covenant with God and with Diane that I intended to keep.</p>
<p>I graduated from the College of Engineering at BYU and I was hired on by a Fortune 500 company and moved Diane and our new son to Denver. From there I continued to work hard, excel at work, and we added additional children as we moved around the country. Diane's health continued to fail, but she never, ever complained. She would say her MS was a blessing. I worked hard and rapidly moved up through the ranks of the companies I worked for; holding positions of Director, Managing Director and Senior Vice President at three different Fortune 500 companies. As I transitioned from company to company Diane was always supportive of my career aspirations. During this time my work-related travel was increasing to weekly travel from coast to coast and border to border. I loved my job. I loved the money, fancy cars, nice hotels, and first class airline seats. The opportunities I was being given for growth were unheard of for anyone of my age in this industry. At the time it was easy to think that I earned these opportunities, but in hindsight, I see the Lord was using these opportunities for training me. He was helping to move me along so I could be at this place, here at BYU-Idaho, at this time in my life.</p>
<p>In January of 2006 I was overseeing facilities operations in over 3,000 banks and campus facilities across the country. I managed over $4 billion in real estate assets and had an $800 million operating budget. From the outside looking in I was successful and I had the perfect family, but my heart was breaking every day-my beautiful helpmate and companion was suffering physically and emotionally from the effects of her multiple sclerosis. It was clear to me that I was going to have to choose between my promise to Diane to help her in her time of need or to continue on my corporate path that I enjoyed immensely.</p>
<p>The day had arrived, my company offered me the position of COO, Chief Operating Officer, over all of Europe, Middle East, and Africa. We would be based in London, and the kids would go to the finest private schools. I had a nice compensation package for housing and salary-everything you could want monetarily. But my wife's health concerned me, how could she handle the kids, driving to school and activities, when her health was getting so bad she was almost to the point of not driving a car and could only walk a few hundred steps a day. So, I went to the Lord in prayer, not once, or twice, but hundreds of times over the period of nine months asking, "What should I do?" I would ask and plead. I put options before the Lord. I created spreadsheets to analyze my options and to work through all possible solutions, but still, no answer. As I was flying from Seattle to New York in November of 2006 the captain of the plane came on the speakers and said, "Folks, we are just headed a little to the north of Rexburg, Idaho, then continuing on just south of Chicago, then into New York." Wait, what? Rexburg? I had flown back east hundreds of times and I had never heard the pilot mention anything in southeast Idaho, especially Rexburg! Pilots don't mention the names of small towns, but he did that day. I had never been to Rexburg, Idaho. I had heard some great things were happening at BYU-Idaho, but what could I do for employment? I landed in New York and will never forget that night when I logged onto the BYU-Idaho website, sitting in the Long Island Marriott, and saw two job openings I could possibly do. I called my wife, told her my crazy plan and she was so excited for me and for our family. I interviewed, received one of the jobs and we moved to Rexburg.</p>
<p>My wife's health continued to fail, but she never once complained, she passed away in the fall of 2014. We had been married 22 years. She was my best friend, my life long companion, and the one I promised I would protect and take care of. I remember when she fell into a coma I crawled up on her bed, I lay beside her and I wailed. It was not crying, it was my heart breaking. I could not believe this day had come. I had 22 years to anticipate this moment. I had gone through it thousands of times in my mind-how I would be prepared and it would be fine. It wasn't fine, it hurt, and it was the most terrible thing I had ever experienced. Later that evening Diane passed onto the other side. The next day my heart broke again, over and over again. My misery was out of control, it is indescribable. I tried praying, asking God for some relief to the pain I was feeling, but to no avail. We had the funeral and I continued for four more days in a fog of pain and suffering. I have had pain in my life, including a broken back, compound fracture in my leg, and broken fingers and hand. I have had torn ligaments in my ankle and knee that had to be surgically repaired. I have had a brain hemorrhage and now have a titanium clip here in my head. I have had third degree burns all over my chest that required a long stay in the hospital and skin grafts. I have had kidney stones, pancreatitis, and my gall bladder removed. I have sinned and gone through a painful repentance process. But having my heart broken was worse than all of these put together. A week after Diane's death I was at home, still not myself, crying, trying to gain composure and my daughter Emily who was 17 at that time came over to me, grabbed me by both arms and said, "Dad, stop this. Mom is so happy now. She is free of pain and the body she was trapped in. She never wanted you or any of us to be sad because of her trials. We can all be together again, but you have to get it together!"</p>
<p>So it was. Emily was right. As my boat sat there floating with no direction, she put wind in my sails. Emily filled my sails and allowed me to get my boat moving again. My heart was broken, my spirit contrite, and I was ready to ask, "Dear Heavenly Father, what am I to learn?"</p>
<p>Example 2: All of us have the chance every day of filling someone's sails. We can also take the wind out of someone's sails as well.</p>
<p>To fully appreciate this analogy all of you need to understand some basics of sailing and the structure of a sailboat. I started sailing with my grandfather in the Puget Sound, just north of Seattle, when I was seven years old. One of the hardest things about moving to Rexburg was selling our family sailboat, which was lovingly named "Nemo."</p>
<p>Sailing is really pretty basic and people around the globe have been sailing for thousands of years. We need to understand four basic components about sailing for this metaphor to make sense:</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rudder steers the sailboat.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The keel balances the sailboat. The Keel is the heaviest part of the sailboat, it helps keep the sail boat straight up. As winds increase and the sailboat lists to one side, the keel works to pull the boat straight up again.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mast carries the sail and takes the strength of the wind through the sails to move the boat along its course.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main sail fills with wind and propels the sailboat. The main sail is the strongest sail that gives power to your sailboat by collecting the wind and directing it through the mast to the boat.</p>
<p>All four of these components must be working together if the sailboat is to move forward. I have had 35 years to think and ponder about life's joys and troubles while sailing, and would like to share with you how I have managed these through the metaphor of sailing.</p>
<p>When wind is in your sails, it propels the boat; it moves you along to your destination. When we say someone has "taken the wind out of our sails" what we are saying is literally, we have taken the ability away for this person to make progress, to move forward, and we have done something that is keeping someone from progressing. We have all been there, on the side of having something bad said to us, or maybe when we have said something unkind to others.</p>
<p>What have you done today to put wind in someone's sails? What have you done that could have taken the wind out of someone's sails?</p>
<p>When I was about 15 years old I was sailing with my brother and grandfather. We had a typical route that would take us across the Puget Sound towards Whidbey Island, then around Hat Island and then sail back to the Marina. This particular day my grandfather wasn't feeling well and he told me the course to take and he was going to take a short nap. As I was sailing I caught a good wind and was making good time. In the distance I saw a large container ship. I knew I should stick to the course outlined for me, but I thought I could sail in front of this container ship and then I could catch the big waves as I crossed over the back of it as it powered by us. About halfway across the path of this large container ship my wind died. I panicked. I did not know what to do. Death was imminent. I could wake my grandfather and confess my stupidity or I could stay there in complete fear and be killed. Both options were equal in my 15-year-old brain. I eventually woke my grandfather. He came up, saw our peril, started the engine, and got us out of harm's way. I can tell you this; he never went to sleep again when I was captain. What can we learn from this? Just like in life, things can be going along well for us, we can be moving along just great, steering our life wherever we choose, collecting wind in our sails from our employment, friends, church callings, then something happens. There is no wind in our sails, it was there one minute, now it is gone. Often times, if not most times, we need someone to help us, to start the engine to our boat as my grandfather did, and to put wind in our sails.</p>
<p>Would you all please take out your cell phones? Yes, take out your cell phones so we can put wind in someone's sails, right now, right here. Think of someone who could use that little extra encouragement. Maybe it is a little sister that just needs to hear from you that you love her. Maybe it is a text to your dad, saying "sorry." Whatever it is, please send a text now. Take a few seconds to fill someone's sails and I will do the same.</p>
<p>How do you feel right now? Great, I hope! The Holy Ghost is our constant companion to help us, he has just helped you to know whose sails to fill. Ask yourself now, "Dear Heavenly Father, what am I to learn?"</p>
<p>Example 3: Single at 43! Learning to date again at my age was a weird experience. I have to apologize publicly that when I saw my kids and you students falling in love through communications via e-mail, texting, skyping, Facebook messages, etc., I thought to myself, "Just pick up the phone already, just like in the old days." What I found though, as I started this dating journey is that you could still use the phone, but all of these other communication mediums were important and I could build a relationship through the use of them as well. Before Diane passed away I did not plan on dating or remarrying after her passing. I planned on going back to corporate and making my mark on the world.</p>
<p>I was interviewing at Microsoft in December of 2014 and had this feeling, a weird feeling, that going back to corporate wasn't what I needed to do. I had gone on one date with Kami McKane, who was a widow with three boys at home. I really liked her. She was smart, funny, pretty, and had a great testimony. My late wife Diane had told me numerous times that she expected that I remarry, but it always seemed weird to talk about. So when I did start dating, I knew I had her blessing, which was a great comfort. Anyway, Kami and I continued on our courtship and we married last year. Many people asked why we would get married again. Kami is sealed to her late husband as I am to my late wife, both of us for time and all eternity. Why get married again, for time only? Our relationship is one of friendship and love, but most importantly to help each other and our children to return undefiled and prepared to sit at the judgment seat of God and return to our eternal companions.</p>
<p>Now we have a blended family of seven children, ages seven to 24. All of our children have had their hearts broken. To lose a mother or father is traumatic. All we can ask is, "Dear Heavenly Father, what am I to learn?" To curse God, blame others or not move on is not God's plan. We must move forward, we can only move forward or backward. Staying in one place is moving backward. Kami is my wife now. She is a great example to me and our children. She went to college and earned her degree in English, with no real plans to ever use it, but knew it was wise to do so. She was married in college to a great man, who provided for her and her children. When he died suddenly of a massive heart attack, she was thrust into the work force. She took on a school teaching job and did that until we married. What would she have done for employment had she not completed her degree is a lesson for anyone contemplating not completing their education.</p>
<p>What can you learn from these three examples I have given today? What can you incorporate into your life right now, right here? &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expect the unexpected, find joy in every day.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put wind in your own sails and in others' through positive thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare yourself mentally, spiritually and physically for whatever may come your way.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always ask yourself, "Dear Heavenly Father, what am I to learn?"</p>
<p>It is a blessing for me to work here at BYU-Idaho. I try every day to make your lives better through the departments I oversee and assignments I take on. To be associated with all of you, students, staff, and faculty with testimonies of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is a blessing in my life and in my family's. I know that God lives. I know without a doubt that there is life after death. We can be with our loved ones again. Be kind, choose good works, and never forget that these lessons in life are learning opportunities. The next time you have a trial or are confused about something that has happened, ask yourself, "Dear Heavenly Father, what am I to learn?" I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>Counselor, Counseling Center</p>
<p>Reed Hendricks grew up in Sugar City, Idaho.&nbsp; He attended school at Ricks College, Utah State University, Eastern Washington University, and BYU.&nbsp; He holds a Master of Social Work, and has done work toward a doctoral degree in Counseling Psychology.&nbsp; He worked with LDS Family Services in the bay area in California, at a psychiatric hospital in Idaho Falls, and has worked at the BYU-Idaho Counseling Center since 1998.<br /><br /> Brother Hendricks served in the California Sacramento Mission from 1975-77.&nbsp; He has held several church callings, including being a counselor in four bishoprics, a high councilor, and the bishop of a YSA ward. He is currently the bishop of the Rexburg Married Student 34<sup>th</sup> Ward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brother Hendricks and his wife, Lynette, have 5 children and 18 grandchildren.&nbsp; Sister Hendricks is an adjunct instructor on campus.&nbsp; She and Brother Hendricks met at Ricks College in a class called "Preparation for Marriage," the same course that Sister Hendricks now teaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p>It is a pleasure and a privilege to be here and to speak to you today. But, observing how large this congregation is, and having a sense of the limitless value that God places upon you, I feel a bit intimidated. So, I made a concerted effort this morning to say a long and heartfelt prayer. But as an extra precaution, I also took my blood pressure pill and then ate a double stuff Oreo cookie! I hope I'm ready!</p>
<p>One of my wonderful sons-in-law does the sound engineering here at the BYU-Idaho Center and he told me that, if I wanted, he could pipe in any of Elder Holland's talks, and I could simply lip sync. That was tempting! But you would see quickly through that charade. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, brothers and sisters, I love this university! I grew up in a nearby little town and have associated either directly or indirectly with this wonderful institution since my youth. I have personally met or had interaction in some small way with each of the former presidents who have served here going as far back as President John L. Clarke. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Like those who have preceded him, I have felt a personal confirming witness of God's hand in bringing President Clark Gilbert here to guide and to bless us. We are also very grateful for the notable contribution and sacrifice of Sister Gilbert and their children. Behind any great university president is a supportive and surprised wife! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I have worked in the fields of social work and psychology for 33 years. I have a vested interest in helping clients and friends change and improve their lives. Likewise, I have a deep personal desire to improve myself as well. I wish, as many of us do, that I would be further advanced in this process of self-mastery than I am as I approach my 60<sup>th</sup> birthday this very week. I assure you that a YouTube video of me walking on water is not likely to be posted anytime soon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But, it is a consuming desire in my heart to be a better man, and to be of some small service to others that intersect in my life and who likewise desire to improve. It is the topic of overcoming "the natural man," that I wish to speak of today. I know such a topic is good for me to review and I hope that it will be of value to you as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the desire of my heart that the influence of the Holy Ghost will be present for both you and me as we consider this topic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As we understand from the scriptures, the "natural man is an enemy to God."<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>The natural man is also an enemy of ours. From time to time when you or I look in the mirror, or consider in our minds who or what we are, we might see ourselves in a distorted and negative way, as though we are seeing a reflection in a carnival mirror. That distorted view of self, that magnified view of the natural man, can be painful and overwhelming. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how remarkably easy it is to see the flaws you have? I've noticed that my natural man has put on some weight, has lost a fair amount of hair, and is still as stubborn as a mule. I see that my natural man still has far too many negative habits and patterns that ought to have been set aside a few decades ago. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have struggled with your humanness, then you surely find solace in the words of Nephi as I do, as that extraordinary prophet empathically spoke for all of us when he proclaimed, "O wretched man that I am!"<sup>2</sup> Or, when the apostle Paul lamented about his "thorn in the flesh."<sup> 3</sup> Add to that list, the valiant apostle Peter who, at one point, was willing to die for or at least with Christ, followed only hours later with a relapse into fear and self-doubt as he denied his beloved Savior three times. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Somehow, it gives me hope to know that even the best of the best also feel a sense of their own humanness. This wrestling match we have with the natural man is not like playing a delightful game of Candy Crush, but rather is hand-to-hand combat that will stretch us to our very limits. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, as mentioned, I have worked as a counselor for over three decades. I love my profession! The understanding in my field about human behavior has seemed to grow exponentially. We know more now than at any prior time, of how to help people change their attitudes and their behaviors. What a wonderful thing! &nbsp;</p>
<p>But, as much as I care for my profession and can better help people increase their knowledge of how to change their behaviors, I have learned something of great importance about overcoming the natural man. In addition to changing attitudes and behaviors, ultimately we must also change our nature. Psychology does not have the answer to that. God does! Changing the nature of man is His specialty. Changing our attitudes and behaviors certainly is a part of the solution, but it tends to have a short shelf life. Changing our nature, with the help of our Father in Heaven and our beloved Savior, leads us to lasting change. It is with His help that we can get to a point where, "we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually."<sup></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>You and I cannot make permanent change in any meaningful aspect of our lives without the help of our Father in Heaven, without the enabling and cleansing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and without the influence of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have come to believe that it does not matter whether we are seeking to improve how fully we live God's commandments, or if we are trying to move away from the revolving door of addictive sin-we must have God's help. It is impossible to fully change without Him. The natural man in us always wants to do it on our own. How well has it worked for the world to depend upon "the arm of flesh?"<sup></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>When we work to improve even basic attitudes or daily habits, we will do it sooner, more effectively, and will see it last when we truly seek and have God's help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what we are trying to change or master in our lives, there is only one way, and He is the "way, the truth, the life."<sup>4</sup> We are utterly dependent upon God, without whom we are "less than the dust of the earth."<sup>5</sup> We access His help to overcome the natural man through increased acts of faith and obedience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also helpful for each of us to understand that overcoming the natural man requires real intent, in other words real commitment, to do whatever it takes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior had brought to him a father whose son was possessed with evil spirits. The disciples of Christ had made an effort to cast out the demons to no avail. They brought the father and his boy to Jesus who promptly cast the evil out. Later, the Savior took advantage of a learning opportunity with his disciples who were confused as to why their efforts to cast out the evil had not been successful. Jesus taught them that, "this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting."<sup>6</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>So it is when we have difficult problems within ourselves to fix, and often, like resistive devils, it will take extra effort, extra faith, and extra prayer before we cast our weaknesses out of our lives. We cannot hope that some outside source will sprinkle pixie dust on us and the problem will magically go away. We must choose to be committed to change! No one can or will do that for us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An additional key to change is to be able to understand the real power within us to improve. Elder Tad R. Callister discussed a time when he and other General Authorities were gathered for training just before a General Conference. One of the Seventy asked the following question. "How can we best help those who struggle with pornography addictions?" Elder Russell M. Nelson was asked to reply. He arose and stated, "Teach them their identity and purpose." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Truly understanding and feeling our eternal identity and purpose is not only essential in dealing with addiction problems, it is fundamental in facing any problem associated with the natural man. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A word of warning: it is vital that we learn directly from God himself about our identity and purpose. It is dangerous to passively turn that to society or to the adversary to tell us who we are and what our purpose in life ought to be. Those sources will give us a distorted view that will suggest that pursuit of pleasure is more important than development of character. Instead, we must hear it from the mouth of our Creator or we risk chasing illusions and shadows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We learn about our identity and purpose through prayer, through our patriarchal blessings, in the scriptures, in the temple, from priesthood blessings given to us for various reasons, and from experiences in our lives that we see have been minutely choreographed by our Father in Heaven and could have happened no other way. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I think of myself primarily as a natural man and as an afterthought that I have a little bit of a divine identity tucked away somewhere, I do not seem to succeed with change. But, when I know and feel the reality that I am a son of God who has a bit of natural man to continue to work on, I feel empowered. I recognize that, as a child of God, in a very real way, I have superhero powers! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another aspect of change that plagues most of us has to do with our struggle to feel motivated to act. Motivation is an elusive and often misunderstood concept. When we face a change that may be difficult in our lives, we can find ourselves emotionally feeling overwhelmed and unmotivated. It is much like sitting on the lawn watching the grass grow, holding a lightning rod up in the air, and hoping to have a bolt of motivation strike us so that we will mow. We cannot approach change hoping that motivation will come from the outside. Motivation originates in our heart, and that will be magnified by a responsive Father in Heaven. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For most of us, we assume that we must first feel motivated, and then we will begin to act. Ironically, it really works the other way around. Most of the time, we begin to act and then the motivation follows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are told that "pioneer children sang as they walked and walked and walked." But, I don't think that there were angelic choruses of children the moment they awoke around 5:00 a.m. and hid behind a sage brush for a somewhat private moment, ate what was likely a boring and bland breakfast, and then started the long 15-20 mile trek of the day. A walk which may have included blistering heat, or frigid cold, or heaven forbid-Rexburg-like wind. &nbsp;</p>
<p>No, I think these sturdy Saints began each day walking with stiff backs, and wondering if this trek would ever end, and if they really had what it took to complete it. But each day as time and distance passed, I believe thoughts of hope and accomplishment began to fill their souls. Motivation likely began to swell within them after they had been walking for a time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps then, pioneer children began to sing as they walked and walked and walked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, keep in mind that the emotion of motivation will usually follow our willingness to act. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, overcoming the natural man will require us to discipline ourselves. It will demand changes in what we do and might include getting up earlier and going to bed earlier. It will require that we put important things first and set aside distracting and childish activities. Simply put, we must be willing to do important things even when we don't feel like it. But, once we get going, the motivation to succeed begins to fill in the gaps. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another helpful concept regarding change includes keeping a proper balance and perspective. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord revealed to Joseph Smith vital counsel when He said, "Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength...but be diligent unto the end."<sup>7</sup> We can't run the marathon of change like it is a hundred yard dash. A steady pace of putting one foot in front of the other and then diligently repeating the process over and over again is the key. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the teachings of Book of Mormon prophets that taught simply but ever so profoundly about change. They counseled us to be "steadfast and immovable."<sup>8</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Steadfast-Steady. I am not very good at "be ye therefore perfect."<sup>9</sup> But I can be steady in trying to do what is right. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Immoveable-Making a serious effort to not lose ground. If we get God's help and steadily act in meaningful ways, we will have the capacity to lean into the winds of adversity and old habits and hold our ground during those stretches when our souls feel empty. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Never forget that steadiness and determination are what transform good or average people into great people. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Though there are many examples I could share, there are two men here at BYU-Idaho who have modeled these qualities for me for decades. Brother Kevin Miyasaki, who serves as our Vice President of Student Life and who is working feverishly to recover from a serious health condition, has been the very prototype of steadiness throughout his life. I have watched him as a next-door neighbor, a friend, and as an associate in Church leadership, and he illustrates how a good man can become great. He fights his currently restrictive body with an unrestricted heart and boundless commitment and is an example to each of us that know and love him beyond words. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise, another dear friend, Steve Zollinger, has been the epitome of consistency for decades now. He is another good man who has become great. Meaning this in a very positive way, if Kevin and Steve can do it, then you and I can do it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Steadiness and determination have been the genesis of more great students than has IQ. These powerful qualities have been central to more outstanding men and women in the Church and in society than any other quality I can think of. Being steadfast and immoveable is an important part of rooting out the natural man. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that the toughest part of change often begins a short time after we have begun our efforts to improve and then we hit the wall in our marathon. We feel like there is nothing left in our tank. But that is the moment we must decide to keep going anyway! Within short order, our sails will fill again with a burst of motivational wind that will take us further on the path to change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An additional aspect of lasting change is how swiftly we choose to act. Keep in mind that procrastination is a fundamental quality of the natural man. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mormon was given a compliment by Ammaron when he stated that the young boy was "quick to observe."<sup>10</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Being "quick to observe," at least in part, suggests an immediate response to do what we ought to do, when we ought to do it. The Holy Ghost, and our own spirit within us, will send signals that we need to respond to rapidly. We risk becoming "past feeling"<sup>11</sup> if over time we hesitate in responding to the heavenly nudges that come. Setting aside for a few minutes our instinct to do something often results in it never getting done. We can become deaf to these signals in much the same way we become deaf to an alarm in the early morning. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the very hallmarks of the success of our beloved prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, has been his willingness to act promptly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast, I have noticed that procrastination has more to do with struggles or even failure in school or life, than does a lack of intelligence. Quick action, channeled in the right direction, has more to do with success than talent. When we feel like giving into the natural man, we must quickly resolve to act positively anyway. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The manner in which we handle negative emotions or thoughts can also slow down our change process. In our climb to become better, it is not unusual for us to relapse and to slip down into a deep crevasse of discouragement. We feel ashamed of ourselves for our seeming failures. Discouragement and shame are like quick setting concrete and result in us feeling stuck and unable to change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We must recognize that there is a world of difference between shame and godly sorrow. Shame is a dark, unrelenting, and unmotivating emotion that implies that "I am bad-I am a failure-I can never change." As a counselor, I assure you that the emotions of discouragement and shame can be at least as debilitating as sin or self-destructive behaviors. Sometimes the first battle we must win is over the Goliath of discouragement and shame. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When Adam and Eve magnified their calling as they freely and lovingly chose the forbidden fruit so that God's plan of happiness could unfold for each of us, the first thing Satan did was to punch them in the gut with shame, pointing out their nakedness, their humanness, their failure to be perfect. By the way, the adversary uses that very approach on you and me each time we sin or fall short. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But, note in the scriptures and in the holy temple how God responded to Adam and Eve. He did not shame them. He taught them to have Godly sorrow and to have hope. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Godly sorrow is when we fully and willingly take responsibility for what we have done, and resolve to keep trying to improve. Godly sorrow includes remembering our true identity and purpose and knowing that as His literal children, we have, with His help, the capacity to change. Likewise, we will know that because of the Atonement of the Savior, there is hope. Our Redeemer has promised that no sin or weakness can hold us eternally hostage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are feeling godly sorrow, you are under God's influence. If you are allowing yourself to feel shame, you are at risk to be under the influence of the adversary. Tell him to "get thee behind me,"<sup>12</sup> and to take shame with him.<sup></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, understand that the power to change grows over time. When I was a young man, the first Apollo rockets were being sent to the moon. I recall NASA reporting that of the total energy expended to get a rocket to the moon and back (an estimated 500,000 miles), it took something like 90 plus percent of that energy to merely get the rocket off the launch pad and up a few hundred miles into an orbit around the earth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That same principle may apply when we try to change. We will feel the resistive effects of gravity and will need to grit our teeth a bit and continue to push ourselves in the liftoff stage, and patiently hang in there until we get into orbit and the habits are more firmly established. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I painfully remember the year 2000 when I weighed well over a hundred pounds heavier than I do today. During the first days and weeks of my effort to reclaim my health, every step on the treadmill felt as though I was trudging up the steepest part of Everest with very little oxygen. But, over time I made it into orbit and the habits were firmly in place. There was a more steady flow of motivation, and I finally began to see the pounds drop and my health improve. My "confidence waxed strong."<sup>13</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Last of all, I desire to share a bit about my father, a wonderful man who struggled for over 40 years with a wide range of serious addictive and destructive behaviors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My father had limited involvement with the church during my youth, and as in some LDS homes, my dear mother had shouldered those responsibilities for our family. Unfortunately, my older brother and I had followed Dad's example and had enrolled in several prodigal son courses and were getting straight A's. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But there were events as I approached age 19, including the clarion call from President Spencer W. Kimball, and the example of some dear friends, that reached deeply into my heart, and I regrouped and sought a call to serve a mission. &nbsp;</p>
<p>No one in my family had served a mission, and I not only wondered if I could do it, I also wondered if my father would support me. I informed my parents of my desire to serve and to my utter surprise Father was delighted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Without thinking, I innocently invited them to go with me into the temple when I would receive my endowment. As soon as that slipped from my mouth, I wondered how I could have said something so insensitive. I knew Dad would want to be there, but would be unable to manage it. His addictions had kept him from attending the temple sealing of each of my sisters, and from taking part in most of the priesthood ordinances that were done in our family. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I eventually received my call to serve in the California Sacramento Mission. Then, on the week I was to speak in sacrament meeting and to attend the temple for the first time before entering the mission home, my mother knocked on my bedroom door on a Sunday evening and asked that I join her and Dad in the front room. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I walked into the room and then it occurred to me what was about to happen. I wanted to jump in and tell Dad that he was a wonderful father and that I loved him. I knew he supported me as best as he could. I did not want him to be ashamed that he would not be with me in the temple. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, before I could speak Dad announced that they had something to tell me. He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a little square piece of paper. He informed me that they had just come from the office of our stake president where they had been issued their temple recommends. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Words cannot describe the overwhelming feelings of love and gratitude that came into my heart. It was like a hundred Christmas mornings wrapped up into that one moment!&nbsp;Now, as a side note, my parents had both received their endowments shortly before I was born, but Father had relapsed rather quickly back into his addictions and into shame, and had seemingly given up ever trying to return. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But before me was the marvel of a changed man. God can do miracles beyond our comprehension including the creation of life and universes that cannot be numbered. But there may be no miracle that can compare to that of the changed nature of one of His stray children. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Father stood at my side as my escort when we attended the temple that week. I did not know at that moment, but I think the temple went through him that day more than he went through it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>By the time I returned home two years later, Father was a special man. He had remained faithful and had already begun serving in what turned out to be nearly a decade as a high priests group leader in his ward and as an ordinance worker in the Idaho Falls Temple. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, when I was only 29 my mother passed away. Less than two years later Father was diagnosed with an advanced cancer and died when I was 32. But, to illustrate all of what I have spoken about in regard to change I desire to share a sacred event that occurred mere days before my father passed away. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While confined to a hospital bed in a nursing facility and knowing that his time on earth was short, Father announced that he wanted a family meeting and desired to hear each of his children's testimony before he left us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We gathered at the appointed day and time in what felt like our own families version of Adam-ondi-ahman. Father, who presided with great majesty as he lay on his bed, asked one of us to pray. He taught us briefly then called upon us one at a time to bear our testimonies. At the conclusion of each testimony, he offered his love and heartfelt pride. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, the definitive evidence of whom he had become unfolded before us. We as a family, especially my older siblings who lived closer to Dad, had tried hard to sweetly care for his needs during those difficult days. We wanted him to feel our love, to feel safe, and to know we were there for him. It was our turn to give back to a man that had given so much to us.</p>
<p>As Dad lay in his bed with little of life left in him, he said, "Now, if any of you would like a father's blessing before I pass, I would love to give it." We gasped as we witnessed such Christlike love that was being offered to us at the very time that we felt it should be reversed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One by one, each of us knelt at his bedside. Though unable to sit up, Father placed one of his large hands on our heads and with the power of God and the refined and beautiful love of a father-a changed and sanctified man, he blessed us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Only a handful of days later our roles were reversed, and I had the sacred privilege of laying my hands upon his head and extending a release from this mortal life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the priceless gifts our father had given us was proof that all of us can change. He had done it with God's help, and that was essential for us to understand. In his own way, Dad had implemented each of the principles of change I have discussed today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, beloved students of this university, I plead with you to know who you are, and what your real purpose is. I pray that you will fervently seek the help of God to change. Stop trying to do it by yourself! Don't wait to feel motivated. Get moving! There is hope. There is no need to inject yourselves with shame or discouragement. Go at a reasonable pace, seeking to be steady and determined. And above all, never give up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I challenge you to consult with our Father in Heaven tonight, and to begin work on something that has held you back for too long. You can do this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that there is a loving Father in Heaven who will help us. Change may not happen overnight, but I testify that it can happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Presiding Bishop</p>
<p>Bishop G&eacute;rald Causs&eacute; was named as presiding bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on October 9, 2015. He filled the vacancy created by Gary E. Stevenson, who became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on October 3, 2015.</p>
<p>Prior to this assignment, Bishop Causs&eacute; served as the first counselor in the Presiding Bishopric since March 2012. He previously served as a General Authority Seventy and as a counselor in the Europe Area Presidency. He is the third presiding bishop born outside the United States and the first for whom English is a second language.</p>
<p>Bishop Causs&eacute; received a master's degree in business from ESSEC in 1987. His career has been in the food industry where he has worked with several supermarket chains and food distribution companies. At the time of his call as a General Authority Seventy, he was the general manager of Pomona, a food distribution company in France.</p>
<p>Bishop Causs&eacute; has served in numerous Church callings, including elders quorum president, bishop's counselor, stake president's counselor, stake president, and Area Seventy.</p>
<p>G&eacute;rald Causs&eacute; was born in Bordeaux, France on May 20, 1963. He married Val&eacute;rie Lucienne Babin in August 1986. They are the parents of five children.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to be with you today in this magnificent conference center. What an impressive gathering of young adults! For the Presiding Bishop of the Church, these types of speaking occasions are fairly rare, so today I feel greatly honored and blessed to have this opportunity to address you. <br /><br /> I'm also grateful to have my dear wife, Val&eacute;rie, with me. In a few weeks we will celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. Anniversaries are emotional moments that bring joy blended with a little bit of nostalgia. As we look back over our years together, we count our many blessings and also take stock of the inevitable passing of time.</p>
<p>It seems like just yesterday when the two of us met.<strong> </strong>I still clearly remember the excitement and the sweet feelings that grew in me as Val&eacute;rie and I began dating. I knew very quickly and without a doubt that she was the one for me-both in this life and eternity. Nothing gave us more joy than spending time together, whether it was walking in the park, studying at the library, or participating in Church activities. We counted each hour and each minute, hoping to be able to stop-or rather slow down-the passing of time so we could enjoy each other's company a little bit longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember once we had an entire day to spend together, so we decided not to do anything. We did not go out, we planned no specific activity-we did nothing! We somehow thought that if we did nothing, time would go by more slowly. Today, remembering this makes me smile. It is rather ironic that we tried to slow down the march of time when we had an eternity of being with each other awaiting us. Even these past 30 years of marriage are but an infinitely small portion of our eternal life together. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Man's Time and God's Time</em></p>
<p>Time is an essential element of our earthly existence as human beings. It is one of our most useful and precious resources. The success of our mortal experience depends in large part on how wisely we use it.</p>
<p>But time is also limited and difficult to manage. It is always too short. A philosopher once noted: "The quantity of interesting things to do on this earth is infinite, but the time we have between our birth and our death is by nature, finite... There are always more interesting books to read than we can ever read, more interesting people to meet than we can ever meet, more beautiful scenery to see than we can ever see."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, it is unrealistic to want to control the passing of time. We often speak of "saving time" or of "taking our time," but whether we act or not, time will still pass at the same speed. We cannot suspend it, slow it down, or speed it up. Each second that arrives flees immediately without ever coming back. There is no pause or rewind button to push.</p>
<p>In order to face the challenges of daily life, men and women of our era are engaged in a breakneck race against time. Today's catch phrase seems to be "Do more and more in less and less time."</p>
<p>We try to scrimp on everything, including on the most precious moments of life. Time for conversation is reduced to a few words thrown about in haste on Twitter or Snapchat. The time spent enjoying a meal is often reduced to a hamburger hastily swallowed after being purchased at the fast food drive-through window. The time to read a book is reduced to surfing the web without reading anything in depth. We are surrounded by a culture of speed and shortcuts.</p>
<p>Yet we do not have to buy into this view of time. As Latter-day Saints, we know that this life is but a fleeting moment. As defined in the plan of salvation, it is also a pivotal time between pre-earth life and eternal life. Each moment, each act, each experience of our mortal lives can influence our eternal destiny and potentially has value that is both priceless and infinite.</p>
<p>We live in two different space-times, which I call "man's time" and "God's time." In Alma we read, "All is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Man's time is counted within and confined to the limits of our own memories. We do not remember our pre-earth life, and we are blind about our future. Conversely, our Heavenly Father has a perfect vision that encompasses the eternities. He "knoweth all things from the beginning"<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a></sup> and "knoweth all things which are to come."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a></sup> He knows us intimately to a degree we cannot even begin to comprehend, and He has a perfect knowledge of our abilities and eternal potential. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the book of Ecclesiastes, it is written, "[God] hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the French edition of the Bible, the words "He hath set the world in their heart" are translated as "He has planted the thought of eternity in their heart." I love the idea that our Heavenly Father has planted in our hearts the ability to think of eternity, which is to reason and act with an eternal perspective.</p>
<p>I invite you to include a vision of "God's time" in your life. Do not allow yourself to be locked in the narrow vision of mortality. Enlarge your perspective to include the eternities. As you do this, your life will be more meaningful and open up new horizons to you.</p>
<p>So how can we give an eternal vision to our mortal lives? I would like to propose five simple principles that, if diligently applied, will help you in this effort. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>First Principle: Learn from Your Past and Move Forward</strong></p>
<p>We all know very little about our future. On the other hand, the past seems to occupy a great deal of our thoughts. It is full of memories-some of them joyous that bring happiness to our souls, and others that we would prefer to forget forever.</p>
<p>One of my favorite cartoon films is <em>The Lion King</em>. Your generation grew up to the sounds and images of this film-I don't need to tell you who Simba and Rafiki are. After the death of his father, the king, Simba flees far from his kingdom because he feels guilt over his father's death. He wants to escape his past, which designates him as the heir to the throne. His friend, the wise old baboon Rafiki, gives him some sound advice in this scene, which I'm sure you will remember:<strong></strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It looks like the winds are changing," says Simba.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Change is good," Rafiki replies. "Yeah, but it is not easy. I know what I have to do, but going back means I have to face my past. I've been running from it for so long."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When Simba says that, Rafiki hits him on the head with his staff. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shocked at that response, Simba asks, "What was that for?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It doesn't matter! It's in the past," replies Rafiki. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yeah, but it still hurts," Simba moans. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Oh, yes," Rafiki answers. "The past can hurt. But the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, all of our past experiences, both good and bad, are useful and contribute in one way or another to our eternal progress. We cannot change the past, but we can learn from it and move forward. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes our past acts like a magnet. It attracts us a little like a "paradise lost" that we continually try to find again. We may say to ourselves, "It was so much better when I lived with Mom and Dad. It was so much more exciting when I was on my mission. It was much more fun when I was in high school with my friends." &nbsp;</p>
<p>I love this video entitled "Look Not Behind Thee,"<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a></sup> which was produced by the Church a few years ago to celebrate the New Year. It begins with a discussion about the story of Lot's wife, who as we know was turned into a pillar of salt after looking back to her past. &nbsp;<br />https://www.lds.org/media-library/video/2010-12-21-new-years-look-not-behind-thee?lang=eng</p>
<p>So my young friends, as Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has said: "I plead with you not to dwell on days now gone nor to yearn vainly for yesterdays, however good those yesterdays may have been. The past is to be learned from but not lived in... Faith is for the future."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a></sup> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Second Principle: Don't Get Discouraged-It Is Never Too Late</strong></p>
<p>Recently I heard the story of John Akhwari. John was a marathon runner who represented the country of Tanzania in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. After running for 20 miles, Akhwari suffered a leg cramp and fell down, dislocating his knee. His coach wrapped his leg and advised him to drop out of the race. He firmly refused and took off running again. The last portion of the race was terribly difficult. Limping, it took him more than an hour to run those last six miles. When he finally entered the stadium to cross the finish line, night was beginning to fall and the spectators had begun to leave. However, when those who remained saw him arrive, they gave him a standing ovation and loudly acclaimed his arrival. After he crossed the finish line, John passed out from exhaustion. Later, journalists went to the hospital and interviewed him. They asked him, "Why didn't you listen to your coach and stop running?" His answer was, "My country did not send me 5,000 miles to start the race; they sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>John Akhwari didn't win a medal that day. But he earned the respect and praises of the public and of his country. He was the true hero of the race. Very few people remember the name of the gold medalist, but many can remember the story of the young runner from Tanzania.</p>
<p>In the same way, our Heavenly Father did not send us to earth to start the race but to finish it. The doors of heaven are open for those who arrive, whether they are early or late. There is no time limit to run the course, no ranking, and no medals. The honors and awards are the same for those who arrive among the first finishers as they are for those among the last.</p>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained this principle in this way: "[The Lord's] concern is for the faith at which you finally arrive, not the hour of the day in which you got there. It is never too late so long as the Master... says there is time."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a></sup> <em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Third Principle: Don't Wait-Now Is the Time</strong></p>
<p>The fact that it's never too late to finish does not mean that we have all the time in the world. The reality is that we don't have much time.</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon, Amulek expounded on the purpose of life. He said, "This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a></sup> He didn't say, "This life is one of the times for men to prepare to meet God." He said it is the time.</p>
<p>This life is the time where the stakes for all eternity are played out-our salvation and our eternal future. The good news is that once we depart this life, if we have remained faithful to the very last moment, we have the assurance of inheriting eternal life. As Elder Bruce R. McConkie said, "There is no such thing as falling off the straight and narrow path in the life to come."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a></sup> So the effort is really worth it. Even if we live to be a hundred years old, this life remains a very brief moment, and it is worth expending all of our efforts to get to where we ultimately want to be.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will remember a general conference talk in which Elder Gary E. Stevenson compared our mortal lives to the four minutes it takes to race a small skeleton sled down the track in the Olympics. Athletes may have prepared themselves all their lives for this one decisive point in time when, in just a few moments, their entire athletic careers can be played out.</p>
<p>While addressing the youth of the Church, Elder Stevenson said: "Now, consider how your pathway to eternal life is similar to these athletes' 'four-minute performance.'...This life is your four minutes. While you are here, your actions will determine whether you win the prize of eternal life... The clock is ticking... Do you sense the urgency?"</p>
<p>Then Elder Stevenson added this encouragement: "Do it now. Don't wait. Your four minutes will pass quickly, and you'll have eternity to think about what you did in this life."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>My dear young friends, someone once said, "Tomorrow is a wonderful place where we store all the things we don't want to do now." But eternity is made up of a succession of nows, not a string of tomorrows. Don't put off your efforts to change and progress. Don't be idle or lazy. Use each moment of your life to prepare for your eternity. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fourth Principle: Accept God's Time </strong></p>
<p>In many respects, our lives are like a stage race. Each age includes a few milestones to be reached. For example, at age 12, a young man may receive the Aaronic Priesthood and a young woman may attend Young Women classes. Sixteen is the age to begin dating. At 18 or 19, it's time to go on a mission.&nbsp;Then you hope to marry after serving a mission.</p>
<p>All of these milestones are good, and they help us to set goals in our lives. However, what happens when our personal circumstances do not allow us to reach these steps at the expected age? I remember one of my daughters saying to whoever wanted to listen that if she wasn't married by the age of 21, it would be a disaster. Happily for her, she did get married at the age of 21. But how many are there among us who don't have those same opportunities? Should we despair when such blessings are slow to come?</p>
<p>The reality is that even if we master our choices and our actions, we have only limited control of our life's timetable.</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks once compared our lives to an athletic competition. At the beginning of the game, even though everyone knows the end time, no one knows what the final score will be. In life, he taught, it's just the opposite. If you are faithful, you can be assured of who will win, but you don't know either the hour or the day when the game will end.<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>God always keeps His promises. For the faithful Saints, blessings will inevitably come, but they will come "in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Recently I received a letter from a young member of the Church whom I met three years ago at the Provo MTC. His words moved me to tears, and I would like to summarize them for you.</p>
<p>Spencer describes himself as being a proud and stubborn young man during his youth. He didn't always live according to the gospel principles and often neglected attending church. Unfortunately, when he was 17, a serious accident left him with a fracture in his spinal column. The accident also fractured his dream of enlisting in the army, a dream for which he had prepared himself many long years.</p>
<p>Spencer began to build a feeling of resentment toward God; how could He have done this to him? One day Spencer's bishop invited him to serve a mission. That inspired him to pray for the first time in a very long time. While he was praying, a thought came to his mind; military service had been his excuse for not serving a mission, but now he no longer had an excuse. He had to go on a mission.</p>
<p>With the help of his bishop, he diligently prepared himself to serve and was called to the Argentina Mendoza Mission. He entered the MTC with great excitement and anticipation in his heart. However, one morning just a week later, Spencer woke up and couldn't move his legs. He was taken to the emergency room in a panic. A couple of days later, even though he was back on his feet, he learned that at the recommendation of his doctors, he had to leave his mission and return home.</p>
<p>Spencer wrote: "I had never been so depressed in my life. I remember going back to the cafeteria and my zone all being there. ... I broke down in tears. I was hurt and shattered to the point where I didn't know if I would ever recover."</p>
<p>Back home, he didn't speak to anyone for three or four days. He sank deeper and deeper into depression and despair. He was bitter toward the Church. He didn't feel comfortable attending meetings in his young adult ward. He felt despised and rejected for not having finished his mission.</p>
<p>But one day he met a wonderful young woman by the name of Elizabeth. They began dating, and she convinced him to return to the Church. One year later they got married, and they are now expecting their first child in August. Spencer started his career selling shoes, but he was able to improve his employment situation to become a personal trainer. Today he and his wife work together and manage their own business that provides wedding services.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Spencer concluded his letter with these words: "I could not be more blessed... Recently, I went through a box of old things and found my missionary journal. Only six pages were filled, and four of those six were thoughts about love and impressions on how a man should love his family. I have now become aware that my mission was a short yet special moment to get my life in order and realize the man I should be. My only regret is not seeing that sooner."</p>
<p>As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said, "Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don't come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come<em>.</em>"<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>We can place our trust in our Heavenly Father. He knows the needs and hopes of each one of us. He loves us with a perfect and infinite love. If we live righteously, we can be assured that everything that occurs in our lives-successes and failures, joys and sorrows-are in accordance with His will and will contribute to our eternal happiness. <em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Fifth Principle: Tomorrow Is the First Day of the Rest of Your Life </strong></p>
<p>We cannot change the past, but we can change the present and the future. We can change the course we are on and build better tomorrows.</p>
<p>I love this encouraging passage: "It is madness to... abandon all dreams because one of them has not come true, to renounce all attempts because one has failed... It is folly to condemn all friendships because one friendship has betrayed you, to no longer believe in love just because one of them was unfaithful, to throw away all chances and opportunities to be happy just because something did not go in the right direction. There will always be another opportunity, another friend, another love, a new strength. For each ending there is always a new beginning."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>What would it be like to live in a world where no one could ever change, where things could never be erased, whether that be our words, our actions, or our mistakes? What would it be like to live in a world where our pain or heartaches lasted forever or where wounds would never heal?</p>
<p>That's what a world without a Savior would be like. Happily, that world does not exist. The Savior came and gave His life for all of us. Thanks to His infinite Atonement, we can access power that will heal our wounds, free us from the chains of sin and suffering, and enable us to improve our lives every day.</p>
<p>This power is accessed through repentance. Repentance is not reserved just for sinners. It is for all who haven't yet reached perfection, which includes you and me.</p>
<p>I invite you to make repentance a part of your daily lives. Don't go to sleep at night without repenting. The process is fairly simple. Evaluate your day, your thoughts, and your actions. Humbly recognize your imperfections and mistakes. Then, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, talk to your Heavenly Father and ask Him to help you be better the next day.</p>
<p>I promise you that if you adopt this simple practice, you will see many things change in your life. It will take place step by step, "line upon line, precept upon precept."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Each day will be the beginning of a new life. <em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, the wall of the Stanford University Memorial Hall is inscribed with words of great wisdom: "All that is not eternal is too short, and all that is not infinite is too small."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>I encourage you not to allow yourselves to become locked in the narrow and short-term perspective of this world. Take a step back and contemplate the eternity that is before you. Move forward without procrastinating and without getting discouraged. Trust in the Lord and His timetable for you. Call upon the power of His atoning sacrifice. In His infinite goodness, He has reserved marvelous blessings for each one of you that will be granted "in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will."<sup><a href="/devotionals/bishop-gerald-causse#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Long ago Val&eacute;rie and I made the decision to adopt an eternal vision for our lives. This has helped us love each moment of our earthly voyage. It has given us courage and hope in challenging times and brought purpose and joy to our existence.</p>
<p>I testify that this life is a wonderful moment of eternity. We are here with a glorious goal, that of preparing to meet our Heavenly Father. He and His Son, Jesus Christ, live. They love us with infinite love, and They desire our eternal happiness. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp;</p>

<p>CEO, Deseret Book</p>
<p>Sheri Dew is a native of Ulysses, Kansas, and a graduate of Brigham Young University.&nbsp; She has authored several books, including the biographies of two presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, President Gordon B. Hinckley and President Ezra Taft Benson.<br /><br /> Sister Dew served as second counselor in the general presidency of the Relief Society from 1997 - 2002, and since March 2002, she has served as the Chief Executive Officer of Deseret Book Company. She now also serves as an executive vice-president of Deseret Management Corporation and currently serves in the Church as a gospel doctrine teacher.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p>It is a privilege to be here-especially with President and Sister Gilbert. They are dear friends and remarkable exemplars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /> Now, we are not here today to listen to me speak. We are here to receive revelation. I invite you to invite the Holy Ghost to speak to you so that you hear what you need to hear. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of years ago a reporter from an international broadcasting network visited Salt Lake City researching a story on women in the Church. She was intrigued that a female was leading a Church-owned media company and asked me for an interview. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked this reporter. She'd done her homework and asked good questions, though one of them was predictable: "How do you feel about not being eligible for priesthood ordination?" I outlined the extensive leadership opportunities women have in the Church and then explained that, as a woman endowed with power in the temple, I had complete access to God's power-or priesthood power-for my own life. And I explained that my focus had long been on learning how to gain full access to that power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She paused and then asked: "Are you saying that you believe you have more access to God's power than I do?" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a loaded question! My brain began to spin in search of a truthful but politically correct answer. But I couldn't bring myself to sell our doctrine or our privileges as women short. So finally I said, "Well, actually ...yes."</p>
<p>"Now, do not misunderstand what I'm saying," I quickly added. "I am not saying the Lord loves me more than He loves you or that I'm better than you. I'm not saying that He is more likely to bless me than you. But if you're asking if I believe I have greater access to God's power than you do, the answer is yes! That is one of the blessings of joining this Church. We believe that when we make promises to God to follow His Son, He in turn makes promises to us. And one of those promises is that He will give us greater access to His power." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I spoke, the Spirit filled the room and disarmed her. Her demeanor softened, and then she asked how the gospel affects me personally. She basically opened the door for me to testify.</p>
<p>I told her that Jesus Christ hasn't just made a difference in my life, He has made all the difference. That every good thing that has ever happened to me has come because of my membership in His Church. And that I have experienced the Savior's healing, enabling power again and again.</p>
<p>At that point, the Spirit flooded the room and we were both in tears. She finally said, "That is beautiful." That day I experienced the sublime beauty of standing as a witness and bearing witness of truth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the miracle of it! Through the power of the Holy Ghost,<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></sup> we can know what is true with enough surety to testify of truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can only bear witness of what we know. We can't testify of a wish or a hope or even a belief. We can express a hope, a wish, or a belief. But we cannot stand as witnesses of Jesus Christ unless we can bear witness of Him.<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a></sup> We can defend the faith only if we have faith. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our society seems determined to set aside any semblance of faith or right and wrong. But the world's condition today is no surprise to the Lord, who told the Prophet Joseph that we are living in the "eleventh hour," that this is the last time He will call laborers into His vineyard, and that His vineyard has become "corrupted."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a></sup> But the Lord also declared that in the midst of all this moral and spiritual chaos, the fullness of His gospel would be "proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a></sup> And He promised that if we would open our mouths, they would be filled.<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a> </sup></p>
<p>You and I are "the weak and the simple," but we are not here now by accident or without the Lord's endorsement. President George Q. Cannon taught that "because of the...magnitude of the work to be accomplished... [it] has required apparently the most valiant men and women to come forth [now]...God has reserved spirits for this dispensation who have the courage and determination to face the world and all the powers of the evil one...and [to] build up the Zion of our God fearless of all consequences."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a> </sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it: You are here now because in the beginning our Father chose you to be here now. And He has hard work for you to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How, then, do we strengthen our faith so that we can defend the faith? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four years ago, a marvelous young woman who had just graduated with honors from BYU called me, distraught. Through sobs she blurted, "I'm not sure I believe the Church is true anymore, and I'm scared. What if &nbsp;my family isn't going to be together forever?" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked, "Do you want a testimony?" "Yes," she said. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you willing to work for it?" Again, "Yes." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And she was. She had a great bishop and an off-the-charts Relief Society president, both of whom worked with her. Friends and family came to her rescue. And she and I began to meet for gospel study sessions. I told her, "Bring your scriptures and every question you have. Questions are good. Let's see what the Lord will teach us." &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She took me at my word and brought one thorny question after another. We searched the scriptures and the teachings of prophets for answers. Little by little, she began to realize that just because she had questions didn't mean she didn't have a testimony. The scriptures are filled with accounts of prophets who had questions. And she began to recognize when the Spirit was bearing witness to her-including bearing witness that prophets, seers, and revelators are truly prophets.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Her testimony began to grow, and time passed. Then about a year ago she called again. "I wanted you to be one of the first to know that I am holding in my hand a temple recommend. Will you come when I receive my endowment?" Then she added, "Do you know what you said that helped me the most? You told me that questions are good, and that allowed me to see myself as a seeker rather than a doubter." &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was overjoyed! But two days later, I received a much different call from another BYU graduate. "Sister Dew," she said, "before you hear it from someone else, I want you to know that I'm pregnant." She said that for several years she had doubted the truthfulness of the gospel and had finally decided there was no reason to live the law of chastity. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I told her that I was not her judge and that I loved her. Then I asked her if she would like to have a testimony. "No, I don't think so," she said.</p>
<p>The contrast was stunning. At about the same time, these two young women had questions that threatened their testimonies. One of them sent out a cry for help, and family, friends and leaders followed President Monson's counsel and went to her rescue. The other girl nursed her doubt and convinced herself that her immoral choices were acceptable. I love and care about this girl. But for now, she has chosen a spiritually perilous path. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One girl's questions propelled her to become a seeker of truth. The other girl used her questions to justify her immorality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear friends, questions are good. Questions are good if they are inspired questions, asked in faith, and asked of credible sources where the Spirit will direct and confirm the answer.<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a> </sup></p>
<p>Nephi asked an inspired question in faith when he asked the Lord if he could see what his father saw. The Lord responded by showing Nephi the tree of life, the iron rod, the great and spacious building and mists of darkness, and the fruit of the tree, which is "sweet above all that is sweet."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[viii]</a> </sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the vision didn't stop there. Nephi saw the birth, ministry, and Crucifixion of the Savior. He saw the coming forth of latter-day scripture, the Restoration, and the building of latter-day Zion.</p>
<p>Nephi saw all this and much more, only to return to his father's tent and find Laman and Lemuel arguing about the meaning of their father's vision. When Nephi asked them, "Have ye inquired of the Lord?" they gave the classic response of doubters: "We have not; for the Lord maketh no such thing known unto us"-as though nothing was required of them.<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[ix]</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of us are entitled to revelation without effort on our part. Answers from God don't just magically appear. If we want to grow spiritually, the Lord expects us to ask questions and seek answers. "If thou shalt ask," He promised, "thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge...."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[x]</a></sup> How much clearer can it be? The Lord loves inspired questions asked in faith because they lead to knowledge, to revelation, and to greater faith.<strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We all have questions. Some are doctrinal, historical, or procedural. Some are intensely personal. Here are just a few of the questions men and women your age have asked me recently: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Why am I the only one in my family who struggles to believe? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Should I serve a mission if my parents don't want me to?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Why did I spend all that time on a mission and not convert anyone?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Why can't I find "the one?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If I go to graduate school, will the Lord think that means I don't want to get married? Will I be able to provide for a family today?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Will the Lord ever forgive me for breaking my covenants?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I came home early from my mission. What do I do now? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Is a prophet infallible?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Did Joseph Smith really have more than one wife?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How do I know if I'm receiving revelation?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do I dare get serious with a guy who has struggled with pornography?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Why can't women be ordained to the priesthood?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What if the Church's position on gay marriage bothers me?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How do I understand the temple when I can't ask questions about it? &nbsp;</p>
<p>May I answer these questions, and any questions you may have, by posing a question: Are you willing to engage in the wrestle? In an ongoing spiritual wrestle?</p>
<p>Enos described the "wrestle that he had before God to obtain a remission of his sins."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[xi]</a></sup> And Alma "[wrestled] with God in mighty prayer."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[xii]</a></sup></p>
<p>Champion wrestlers tell me that it isn't necessarily the strongest wrestler who wins. It is the wrestler who knows how to leverage his strength to overpower his opponent. Spiritual wrestling leverages the strength of true doctrine to overpower our weaknesses, our wavering faith, and our lack of knowledge. Spiritual wrestlers are seekers. They are men and women of faith who want to understand more than they presently do and who are serious about increasing the light and knowledge in their lives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently engaged in a wrestle. When the policy was announced that the children of gay parents might not be eligible for baptism at age eight, I was confused. I did not question the Brethren or doubt their inspiration, but neither did I understand the doctrinal basis for the policy. So I asked the Lord to teach me. I prayed, searched the scriptures, studied the teachings of prophets, and pondered my question in the temple. This went on for several months. Then one day a colleague made a statement that sparked a new thought for me, and in that moment the Spirit illuminated the doctrine in my heart and mind. I consider that answer personal revelation and not something I should teach. Though I have wept with friends to whom this policy directly applies, the doctrine gave me peace and understanding.<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[xiii]</a></sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we have unresolved questions, our challenge doesn't lie in what we think we know. It lies in what we don't yet know. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord has promised to open the "eyes of our understandings"<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[xiv]</a></sup> and to reveal "all mysteries."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[xv]</a></sup> But He isn't likely to do either of these unless we seek to know. Truman Madsen taught that he could find "nothing in the scriptures...to excuse anyone from brain sweat and from the arduous lifetime burden of seeking 'revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge.'"<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[xvi]</a></sup> He was describing an ongoing spiritual wrestle. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord wants us to ask every probing question we can muster because not asking questions can be far more dangerous than asking them.<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[xvii]</a></sup> In other words, sin makes you stupid-and so does refusing to seek after truth.</p>
<p>Remember my friend who thought she'd lost her testimony? Her doubt was triggered by a television drama featuring a scientist who didn't believe in God. I said, "You mean that a fictional character fabricated by a Hollywood writer has obliterated 24 years of gospel teaching?" "But she's so smart," my friend said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have always been and will always be charismatic men and women who can launch what sound like, on the surface, reasoned arguments against the Father and the Son, the Restoration, the Prophet Joseph, the Book of Mormon, and living prophets. But doubters and pundits never tell the whole story, because they don't know the whole story-and don't want to know.&nbsp;They opt for clever sound bites, hoping no one digs deeper than they have.</p>
<p>Sound bites will never lead to a testimony. As seekers of truth, our safety lies in asking the right questions, in faith, and of the right sources-meaning those who only speak truth: such as the scriptures, prophets, and the Lord through the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball declared, "Why, oh, why do people think they can fathom the most complex spiritual depths without the necessary...work accompanied by compliance with the laws that govern it? Absurd it is, but you will...find popular personalities, who seem never to have lived a single law of God, discoursing...[about] religion. How ridiculous for such persons to attempt to outline for the world a way of life!...One cannot know God nor understand his works or plans unless he follows the laws which govern."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[xviii]</a> </sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions are not just good, they are vital, because the ensuing spiritual wrestle leads to answers, to knowledge, and to revelation. And it also leads to greater faith.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Men and women of faith are expected to have faith. While the Lord will reveal many things to us, He has never told His covenant people everything about everything. We are admonished to "doubt not, but be believing."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[xix]</a></sup> But "doubting not" does not mean understanding everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doubting is not synonymous with having questions. To doubt is to reject truth and faith. As covenant sons and daughters, we are required to have faith, live by faith, "ask in faith, nothing wavering,"<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[xx]</a></sup> and "overcome by faith."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[xxi]</a></sup> Learning by faith is as crucial as learning by study, because there are some things we cannot learn from a book.<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[xxii]</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks underscored this truth: "[A]fter all we can publish, our members are sometimes left with basic questions that cannot be resolved by study...Some things can be learned only by faith. Our ultimate reliance must be on faith in the witness we have received from the Holy Ghost."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[xxiii]</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, once the Spirit has borne witness to you that God is our Father and Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was a prophet called to restore the gospel, and that we are led by a prophet today, then you know the gospel is true because the Spirit has borne witness of the foundational truths that comprise a testimony. You have a testimony!</p>
<p>At that point, when questions arise or when blessings you've been pleading for remain unfulfilled, they are not an indication that you don't have a testimony or that the gospel isn't true. They are an invitation for you to grow spiritually. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I repeat, once you have received a spiritual witness of the truths that form a testimony, even your thorniest questions about our doctrine, history, positions on sensitive issues, or the aching desires of your hearts, are about personal growth. They are opportunities for you to receive personal revelation and increase your faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don't have to have answers to every question in order to receive a witness, bear witness, and stand as a witness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But questions, especially the tough ones, propel us to engage in a spiritual wrestle so that the Lord can lead us along. Without plain old spiritual work, even God can't make us grow-or at least, He won't.<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[xxiv]</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My life has been filled with spiritual wrestling-not because of any great valor on my part but because I have yearned to understand why certain things were happening to me, and why others were not. For decades I have fasted, prayed and pleaded for a husband. I've asked who he is, where he is, and when he's coming. As of today, I still don't know the answer to any of those questions. But the wrestle has blessed me with the knowledge that Jesus Christ is my Savior, that His gospel is filled with power, and that God will talk to and direct me.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Growing spiritually and receiving answers to our questions depends &nbsp;upon our ability to feel, hear, and understand the whisperings of the Spirit. It is worth engaging in a spiritual wrestle to learn to receive personal revelation, because we can only know what is true when the Spirit bears witness to our hearts and minds as only the Holy Ghost can.<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[xxv]</a></sup> Revelation must include both, because intellect alone cannot produce a testimony. You cannot think your way to conversion, because you cannot convince your mind of something your heart does not feel.<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[xxvi]</a> </sup></p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph declared that "the Holy Ghost...comprehends more than all the world"<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[xxvii]</a></sup> and that we must all "grow into the principle of revelation."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[xxviii]</a></sup>&nbsp; And President Henry B. Eyring added: "We all know that human judgment and logical thinking will not be enough to get answers to the questions that matter most in life. We need revelation from God...We need not just one flash of light and comfort, but we need the continuing blessing of communication with God."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[xxix]</a></sup> Every truth-seeking member of the Church can and should be receiving revelation for his or her life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my early twenties, I faced a difficult decision and asked a friend for a priesthood blessing. He asked what the Lord had already told me, and I admitted that I could feel the presence of the Spirit but couldn't discern specific revelation. He then asked if I had ever asked the Lord to teach me what it felt like when He was speaking to me? I hadn't. But that night, I began to ask the Lord to teach me the language of revelation.</p>
<p>That was forty years ago, and over time I have come to know that what President Boyd K. Packer taught is true: That "if all you know is what you see with your natural eyes and hear with your natural ears, then you will not know very much."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[xxx]</a> </sup></p>
<p>Seekers have certain habits that are key to learning to communicate with God. For starters, they engage in the wrestle, meaning they work at it. They immerse themselves regularly in the scriptures, because the scriptures are the textbook for the Lord's language. They also work to be increasingly pure-pure in their heart and thoughts, pure in what they say, watch, read, and listen to. Purity invites the Spirit. And then, pure seekers listen. One of my former institute students periodically turns everything electronic off. TV off. Music off. Phone off. Computer off. She says, "I like to let the Lord know I'm listening."</p>
<p>As you cultivate these spiritual habits, there are two questions that will help open the heavens. First, ask the Lord to teach you what it feels and sounds like for you when He is speaking to you via the Holy Ghost, and then watch how He tutors you. And, second, if you've never asked the Lord how He feels about you, that is a great question to ask. In time, He will tell you, and as He does, you'll learn more about speaking His language.</p>
<p>When the Lord sees that you want to communicate with Him, He will teach you how. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, a friend working on her Ph.D. received an impression during a Relief Society conference to shift the focus of her dissertation. She also felt prompted to go directly to the temple to ask the Lord further questions. She said, "While there, I was told how to make [this new focus] work...[and] how I could be both academically unbiased and spiritually honest. I occasionally receive clear words from the Spirit, but never have I been given such clear instructions....The task ahead feels incredibly difficult, but I know what direction to go and that the Lord expects it of me, and that makes all the difference."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[xxxi]</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Receiving revelation is the key to receiving answers to our questions. Joseph Smith promised that "even the least Saint may know all things as fast as he is able to bear them."<sup><a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">[xxxii]</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear friends, make no mistake about it: we are here now because we're supposed to be here now. And we each have a mission to fulfill. Part of that mission requires us to stand as witnesses of truth. And that means we must receive a witness that Jesus is the Christ and that His gospel has been restored. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I invite you to decide today that you will pay the price to wrestle with difficult questions, to become lifetime seekers of truth, to learn to speak the Lord's language, and to receive a witness of Jesus Christ and the Restoration of His gospel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you will, you'll have the privilege of helping prepare the earth for His return. You'll be able to defend the faith because of your ever-increasing faith.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior is going to come again. May we stand for Him and with Him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus is the Christ. This is His Church, and it is filled with His power. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

(Moroni 7:19.) <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref8" name="_edn8" title="">[viii]</a> Alma 32:42. <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref9" name="_edn9" title="">[ix]</a> Nephi went on to teach his brothers, "Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?-If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive,...these things shall be made known unto you. (See 1 Nephi 15:8, 9, 11.) <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref10" name="_edn10" title="">[x]</a> D&amp;C 42:61. <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref11" name="_edn11" title="">[xi]</a> Enos 1:2. <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref12" name="_edn12" title="">[xii]</a> Alma 8:10. Paul told the Ephesians that "we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." (Ephesians 6: 12-13.) <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref13" name="_edn13" title="">[xiii]</a> Look at the life of any prophet, and you'll find lots of spiritual wrestling. Imagine the pleadings of Joseph, sold into Egypt by jealous brothers; or Brigham Young's, as he led a band of beleaguered converts on a trek through uncharted territory to a place he'd only seen in vision.&nbsp; <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref14" name="_edn14" title="">[xiv]</a> D&amp;C 76: 19. <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref15" name="_edn15" title="">[xv]</a> See D&amp;C 76: 7, 8. <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref16" name="_edn16" title="">[xvi]</a> Truman G. Madsen, <em>Defender of the Faith</em>, Bookcraft, 1980, 387. Elder Richard G. Scott taught that "the Lord will not force you to learn. You must exercise your agency to authorize the Spirit to teach you. (21 Principles: Divine Truths to Help you Live by the Spirit, Deseret Book, Salt Lake City.) The scriptures repeatedly urge us to "ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." (See Matthew 7:7; 3 Nephi 14:7; 3 Nephi 27:29.) <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref17" name="_edn17" title="">[xvii]</a> The scriptures are filled with warnings like this one: "Wo be unto him that saith: We have received, and we need no more." (2 Nephi 28:27.) The Lord also said, as a further example of this point,&nbsp; "Wo unto the deaf that will not hear; for they shall perish. Wo unto the blind that will not see; for they shall perish also." (2 Nephi 9:31-32.) A pattern of not seeking help from heaven blocks revelation and leaves a person alone with downward spiraling thoughts or seeking out like-minded doubters in the blogosphere. <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref18" name="_edn18" title="">[xviii]</a> Spencer W. Kimball, "Absolute Truth," BYU Devotional, 6 September 1977, found at www://speeches.byu.edu. <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref19" name="_edn19" title="">[xix]</a> Mormon 9:27-28. <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref20" name="_edn20" title="">[xx]</a> Joseph went to the grove after reading, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God...." The very next verse admonishes us to "ask in faith, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing wavering.</span> (James 1: 5, 6.) <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref21" name="_edn21" title="">[xxi]</a> D&amp;C 76:53. <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref22" name="_edn22" title="">[xxii]</a> See D&amp;C 88:118. Faith does not stand still. It is either increasing or disappearing. As President Henry B.&nbsp; Eyring has said, "Faith has a short shelf life." ("Spiritual Preparedness: Start Early and Be Steady,"<em> Ensign</em>, November 2005.) <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref23" name="_edn23" title="">[xxiii]</a> Dallin H. Oaks, "Opposition in All Things," April 2016 General Conference. President Harold B. Lee said something similar: "It is not the function of religion to answer all the questions about God's moral government of the universe, but to give one courage, through faith, to go on in the face of questions he never finds the answer to in his present status." (<em>Conference Report</em>, October 1963, 108.) &nbsp; <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref24" name="_edn24" title="">[xxiv]</a> President Howard W. Hunter explained that "the development of spiritual capacity does not come with the conferral of authority. There must be desire, effort, and spiritual preparation. This requires, of course,...fasting, prayer, searching the scriptures, experience, meditation, and a hungering and thirsting after the righteous life." (<em>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Howard W. Hunter</em>, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2015, 82.) Sometimes we look upon those who have strong testimonies and wonder if faith somehow comes "naturally" for them. But even those blessed with the gift to believe must wrestle for revelation and greater faith. In fact, it is likely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because</span> of their challenges that their testimonies have been forged-and usually in the "furnace of affliction." (See Isaiah 48:10.) <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref25" name="_edn25" title="">[xxv]</a> DYc 8:2-3. <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref26" name="_edn26" title="">[xxvi]</a> Abinadi told the wicked priests of King Noah that they had not applied their "hearts to understanding; therefore, ye have not been wise" (Mosiah 12:27; 13:11). King Benjamin told his people that true followers of Christ would have His name written in their hearts. (See Mosiah 5:12.) One way to know you're receiving revelation is that you will have both clarity of thought and feel peace. <a href="/devotionals/sheri-dew#_ednref27" name="_edn27" title="">[xxvii]</a> This quote in context reads: "I have an old edition of the New Testament in the Latin, Hebrew, German and Greek languages....I thank God that I have got this old book; but I thank him more for the gift of the Holy Ghost....The Holy Ghost...comprehends more than all the world; and I will associate myself with him." (<em>Teachings of the Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith</em>, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2007, 132.) Joseph Smith also said, in a frequently quoted but important statement: "God hath not revealed anything to Joseph, but what He will make known unto the Twelve, and even the least Saint may know all things as fast he is able to bear them, for the day must come when no man need say to his neighbor, Know ye the Lord; for all shall know Him...from the least to the greatest."

<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hope</strong><br /><br /> &nbsp; I am happy to be with you during this devotional hour. I thank the University for this opportunity. I surely appreciate your presence here. The Lord declared: "as two or three are gathered in my name, there I will be also."<sup>1</sup> May the Master be with us as we share this occasion together. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, to those for whom life has passed them by and are now at the beginning stages of the Pathway Program. I want you to hold on. You keep going. You go ahead and shower those dear service missionaries of yours with all kinds of questions. You move forward. Some Pathway students have matriculated into my courses on campus. Now, matriculating on campus is not a necessity, but some have, and they have surprised me with their maturity and their dedication to succeed. The few art slides you will see today have been created by a student who has come to us through Pathway. So, I encourage you to keep going. You get this done. You get the certification or the degree you are seeking. I offer the same love and concern to our online students. You also keep going. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To those of you who struggle for multiple reasons, as students, as members of families, as individuals, whether it be because of mental illness, or addictions, or bad habits, or strenuous relationships, or some other way. You also keep going. You hold on. You reach out and get help. You also give help. We need you. The university needs you. The Church needs you. The Lord needs you. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland<sup> </sup>often says: "Don't you quit. You keep walking. You keep trying. There is help and happiness ahead."<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I will tell you about a story that will help us understand the word enmity. We will then explore misplaced enmity and its antidote. I will conclude with an invitation to let your voice be heard, using letters, to break down this misplaced enmity. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Master Cornille's Secret&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The story I have chosen for you today comes from a selection of letters called "Letters from my Windmill."<sup>3</sup> In one of those letters, the author, Alphonse Daudet, speaks of a Master-and his secret. Master Cornille, as he is called, lives in a village in southern France where there are windmills. People from all around bring their wheat to be ground at those mills. You can see the windmill sails turning thanks to the wind. There are strings of tiny donkeys loaded with sacks of wheat going up and down those windmills. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the world is changing. Entrepreneurs from Paris decide to build steam-powered mill-plants in the area. Windmills fall out of favor with the locals. They now bring their wheat to the more performant machines. All the neighboring windmills shut down. All, that is, except for one. The one windmill continues to whirl courageously. The Master of the windmill, Master Cornille, who has spent more than 60 years perfecting his craft, does not like the new machines; in fact, he detests them. He believes the Mistral wind that powers his windmill is the breath of God. So he touts the praises of the windmill-but no one listens. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In resentment, he decides to shut himself up in the windmill, and leaves it on occasion to take walks with his granddaughter, Yvette. Often, he walks five kilometers, on foot, in bright sun light, just to see her at her place of work. He observes her working there, all day, with tears in his eyes. Many people in the village think the Master is stingy for not taking better care of her; her parents, you see, have died years ago. On Sundays, Master Cornille sits in the back of the church, with the poor folks, with no shoes of his own, and worn down clothes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For a long time now, no one from the village has brought any kind of wheat to his windmill. The blades of his windmill, however, are turning just as before. Something is amiss. Something is not right. Something isn't quite clear. At times a village farmer comes around and asks him "Good evening Master Cornille, the work is going well, is it? And the master always responds, while the door behind him is shut, "Praise and Glory, I am not short of work". So the people get more curious. At times, when asked the same question, he replies: "I am into exports, please keep this quiet". Now rumors are spreading like wild fire. Everyone has an explanation for Master Cornille's secret. Perhaps he has more money in his bags than he has wheat. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, a villager attempts to enter the windmill to discuss wedding arrangements between his boy and Yvette, but Master Cornille does not open the door. He, instead, responds rudely. The villager, however, is able to keep calm. The villager returns to the couple bearing no good news. The couple decides to go up to the windmill by themselves. By the time they arrive, Master Cornille has left the place and, by a stroke of inattention, has forgotten to take away the ladder on the side of the structure. The young couple climbs up and enters the windmill. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once inside, they discover the secret. The milling room is empty. Not a bag of wheat, not the slightest trail of flour on the ground. No sweet smell of freshly ground grain. Everything is covered with dust. The couple now knows Master Cornille's secret. Master Cornille was hauling plaster on his donkey every day, to save his honor, to make people think he was still in business. But the steam powered plants had long ago taken away his last customers. The blades, you see, continue to turn, but the stone is grinding-nothing. The couple returns to the village in tears from the ordeal and tells the secret. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the secret is told, and without waiting so much as a minute, the villagers gather together and agree, right then and there, to take all of the grain that they can find in all of their homes and to bring it to Master Cornille's windmill. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A huge procession of donkeys comes up to the windmill, loaded with wheat. The Master, who is now back, sits on a bag of plaster, and greets them with tears in his eyes, praising God, and dissing the power of steam mills and their greedy owners, saying: "I knew you would come back, the steam mills people are too greedy aren't they?" The villagers desire to carry the Master around the village in a triumph procession; but he refuses. He wants to stay behind to feed his windmill, at last. And they all have tears in their eyes, looking at the old man working the mill masterfully.</p>
<p>Since that day, the villagers never let the old miller go without work. Then, one morning, Master Cornille passes away, and the wings of the windmill cease to turn. The breath of life has returned home. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enmity</strong></p>
<p>I wonder who you connected with in this story. Did you see yourself in the young maiden, or the entrepreneurs from Paris, or Master Cornille, or some other personage? No, I believe you saw yourself as the donkey, didn't you? Of course you did; you are feeling the weight of homework on your backs and people are telling you what to do and where to go, aren't they?</p>
<p>On a more serious note, I wonder how you and I would respond after hearing Master Cornille's secret. Would we mock him, believing he is a fool? We could have a good laugh, you and I, at his expense, you know. Would we stand by and do nothing, while pitying him in his sad state, believing he has brought this upon himself? Which he has. Would we be annoyed at the lack of care for his granddaughter? Would we crucify his character as no good and full of pride? Would we harbor resentment against this Master Cornille? Would we print a t-shirt that says: "Keep calm and don't be a Cornille?" Could this be the beginning of our feeling enmity towards him? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Enmity, you see, is a wedge that we sometimes place between people. Enmity is strongest when we choose to hate. Enmity is the end of goodwill towards others. In the Pearl of Great Price, the Lord teaches that He "will put enmity between thee and the woman, between thy seed and her seed; and he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."<sup>4</sup> So, I ask of you today, between whom is enmity placed? Is it between us, as children of God? Is it between us, as husbands and wives? Is it between us and other great religions? Is it between us and the non-religious people? Is it between us and refugees? Is it between us and political figures? Is it between us and our crazy roommates? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I propose to you today that the true enemy, the one for which and for whom we should feel enmity, is sin; that is, the sin within us, and the master of sin, or Lucifer, the one who rules in darkness in our world. "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood [in other words, the wrestle is not to be had between those of us who have bodies], but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."<sup>5</sup> So, perhaps hating each other, or Master Cornille, or our enemies, or our political figures, and so on, is misplaced enmity. The father of deception is using this enmity to fool us and make us think we are each other's enemy. This way we may feel justified in hating others. A clever deception perhaps. A costly deception for sure when it comes to lives lost. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me tell you a short story about my Grandfather, Jean Marcel Joly, that happened during WWII. He was a tail gunner. He was placed in a crammed gunnery position behind the tail section of a B-26 Marauder Bomber. He was captured in 1941 by the German army and was assigned to be a cook for them. The German army took one of the best restaurants in the region in the city of Meau. The restaurant was called <em>La Sirene</em>. The German army made that place their headquarters. Yes, the German army still acknowledged the superiority of French cuisine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>During this period, Jean was married to my Grandma Rose. Soon, Jean became a father. Sadly, however, their first infant boy died. And my grandparents had neither money, nor possessions of their own. A German general was moved with compassion for my grandparents and provided the necessities for a proper burial. This family story surprises me. It surprises me because French history taught us as children that the German army was the bitter enemy. And enemies are not supposed to be nice. But the enemy had shown deep compassion for my family. I like to believe that in this context, the German general avoided misplaced enmity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have here with us, on the stand behind me, the son of one of the soldiers who freed the very city where my grandfather was held captive. This soldier was part of the 1st Infantry Division of the US Army. They called themselves "The Big Red One." We do not know whether they met, his father and my grandfather, but I do know they shared an important part of world history together. The name of this soldier was John Paul Bogetti. He received a purple heart for the battle in the Ardenes. His son, who is here with us today, is John William Bogetti, or Jack for short. It is an honor for me to be with him and to be with you at devotional today. Jack, you see, is my good neighbor. He is a self-appointed Jeep archeologist, including WWII Jeeps. He digs them. Thank you Jack for keeping the sacrifice of that great generation awake in our hearts and for loving the children of our neighborhood. Never once have I heard Jack project hatred for the enemy in that war. I am starting to believe it is war itself, and not the people who are engaged in it, that is the enemy. War surely prevents families from flourishing. I am also hearing this message through people like Captain Moroni, Mother Teresa, Victor Frankl, Gandhi, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Malala, Abraham Lincoln, John Adams, Lech Walesa, and many others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ancient prophets have been concerned with this misplaced enmity when it comes to the scriptures themselves. For example, in the Book of Mormon, the prophet Ether was afraid that we would look at his written account and mock it because the writing was weak. So we could potentially laugh it up, you and I, and scorn the writing style. The Lord, however, gave him comfort. "... and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that they shall take no advantage of your weakness."<sup>6</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us be meek. Let us not take advantage of others because of their weakness. Cutting people down because of their weakness is a death job. Death to kindness. Death to the social feeling. Death to forgiveness. Death to relationships. Death to families. And death to love. The dark deception of misplaced enmity will ruin our lives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The deception of misplaced enmity was put to rest by the Savior who taught us<sup>7</sup> to love our enemies, to bless them that curse us, to do good to them that hate us, and to pray for them which despitefully use us, and persecute us. Love is the antidote. Now, loving our enemies does not mean that we necessarily let them trample on our God-given liberty. But you will remember the army of Captain Moroni-who fought for their wives, and their children, and their liberty-did not feel hatred for their enemies. I will refer you to the devotional address given by Brother David Pulsipher on the 8<sup>th</sup> of March of this year, titled "Love Your Enemies," for a discussion on love as courage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if the father of deception wants to strike at the plan of salvation and engage his plan of misery using misplaced enmity, what will he do? I believe the answer is simple. He will have us turn nasty on each other. He will nurture hatred in our hearts. I like the words of the great president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, who said: "A house divided against itself cannot stand."<sup>8</sup> It is hatred that divides; not the hatred others may feel for us, but the hatred we feel for them. We are it. We choose. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, where will Lucifer strike? Where does it hurt most? In the Saturday morning session of General Conference in November of 2003, Elder M. Russell Ballard taught: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That the family is the main target of evil's attack and must therefore be the main point of our protection and defense. As I said once before, when you stop and think about it from a diabolically tactical point of view, fighting the family makes sense to Satan. When he wants to disrupt the work of the Lord, he doesn't poison the world's peanut butter supply, thus bringing the Church's missionary system to its collective knees. He doesn't send a plague of laryngitis to afflict the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. He doesn't legislate against green Jell-O and casseroles. When evil wants to strike out and disrupt the essence of God's work, it attacks the family.<sup>9</sup><sup></sup> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Love</strong></p>
<p>A good way to attack the family is to have it turn against each other. Think about Cain and Abel. Cain chose to feel hatred for the Lord and blame Satan for the evil and greedy choice he had made to kill his brother. He tried to avoid responsibility at every turn by blaming others for what he chose to interpret as wrongdoings being done towards him. He was, in fact, covering up his sin. The way to blame others is easy. The way to misplaced enmity is easy because it takes away the need for us to change, and it allows us to point the finger at others instead. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid this ruin, families look to the Savior's love and the bonds of covenant. Sister Christine Gilbert, in a devotional address given with her husband in January of this year titled "Happiness in Family Life," taught: "Happiness in marriage comes when we are attuned to the needs of our companion and serve our spouse in Christlike ways."<sup>10</sup> Sister Gilbert's statement got me thinking about those Christlike ways. Are those ways different types of languages to be assigned and used at will? Are those ways a type of training I can certify in? Are those ways to be used to get the love I believe I deserve? &nbsp;</p>
<p>We sometimes believe love is something we should have, as if it were a possession, or a good catch, especially when she or he is a 10. So, we look for a mate or a friend who will give us what we want to have. We make good and sound measurements of a potential partner's qualities, with positive attributes on the left side of the page, and negative attributes on the right side of the page. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the balance is in the positive, then we may regard this person as a potential mate or friend. If it's negative, however, we dismiss them. We don't hang out with such people. They are, perhaps, very much like the Lamanites who were a scattered, dirty, and filthy people. These guys definitely were on the negative balance. We don't attach our lives with these kinds of people. They just don't give us the love that we need, expect, or deserve. We, after all, are the measure of all things good; we know what's up. We do, however, search for a partner who will be found in the positive and who will carry the relationship as a team effort where both partners put in 100 percent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And believe me, I will keep track whether you do keep that effort. I will keep track of the things you said you would be doing. I will keep track of you doing the dishes, vacuuming the floor, preparing my meals, being quiet when I study, and showing that you are pulling your weight in this relationship. But what if you don't give it your 100 percent, or your 50 percent as I give my 50 percent, then what? I will feel like I have been had. That I deserve better. That you are slowing me down on my progression. I may start looking elsewhere for fulfillment. I may start looking to others for a better ratio. I will start misplacing enmity by putting it between you and me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With this way of thinking, I have given up my ability to choose to love. It is now my self-oriented perception of the balance of efforts put out by the other person that chooses for me. I am now acted upon by a perceived behavioral or attitudinal ratio of effort put out by, in this case, my spouse. So when things go down, and I perceive my effort to be good or I want to hide my own weakness by exposing what I believe is a greater weakness in others, I can now blame my spouse; I can throw the first stone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the social sciences, this model is called the social exchange theory. The social exchange is transactional. You give me this, I give you that. You don't give me this, I am not happy. I feel enmity. You should be the instrument that provides me the happiness and love I deserve. I, of course, can replace the instrument. It needs to be a win-win. If there is a win-lose, however, one of us is getting out. Now I ask of you: Is this how we love our spouse, or our friends, or our enemies? Is this how the Lord loves? Are those the Christlike ways Sister Gilbert was talking about? &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the book, titled "Standing for Something,"<sup>11</sup> President Gordon B. Hinckley speaks of love as the only force that can erase differences between people or bridge the chasms of bitterness:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In our youth, we sometimes acquire faulty ideas of love, believing that it can be imposed or simply created for convenience. I noted the following in a newspaper: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"One of the grand errors we tend to make when we are young is supposing that a person is a bundle of qualities, and we add up the individual good and bad qualities, like a bookkeeper working in debits and credits. If the balance is favorable, we may decide to take the jump [into marriage]...The world is full of unhappy men and women who married because they believed it...to be a good investment. Love, however, is not an investment; it is an adventure. And when marriage turns out to be as dull and comfortable as a sound investment, the disgruntled party soon turns elsewhere...Ignorant people are always saying, "I wonder what he sees in her," not realizing that what he sees in her (and what no none else can see) is the secret essence of love." &nbsp;</p>
<p>President Hinckley goes on to say: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I think of two friends from my high school and university years. He was a boy from a country town, plain in appearance, without money or apparent promise. He had grown up on a farm, and if he had any quality that was attractive, it was the capacity to work. He carried bologna sandwiches in a brown paper bag for his lunch, and swept the school floor to pay his tuition...She was a city girl who had come out of a comfortable home. She was wholesome in her decency and integrity...Something wonderful took place between them. They fell in love. Some whispered that there were far more promising boys for her, and a gossip or two noted that perhaps other girls might have interested him...Now many years have passed. Their children are grown, a lasting credit to them, and to the communities in which they live...Forty years earlier, people without understanding had asked what they saw in each other...But these two found in each other love, loyalty, peace, and faith in the future. There was a flowering in them of something divine, planted there by that Father who is our God.</p>
<p>Our dear Lord has given us the following charge in Ephesians<sup> </sup>5:25:<strong> "</strong>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it."<sup>12</sup> How did Christ love the Church? He gave his life for her. That's how we love, selflessly. I believe we too often forget the new commandant given in John<sup> </sup>13:34: "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another."<sup>13</sup> This is very different from loving others as ourselves, isn't it? We are not the center of that love anymore. Christ is the center of that love.</p>
<p>A great Christian from Northern Europe, named S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard, said: "With respect to love we speak continually about perfection and the perfect person. With respect to love Christianity also speaks continually about perfection and the perfect person. Alas, but we men talk about finding the perfect person [who will love us]. Christianity speaks about being the perfect person who limitlessly loves the person he sees."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>Now, let's make our relationship with the Lord transactional for a moment and try the experiment. Give the Lord back the 50 percent you know he deserves for what he has given you. In fact, give him all you got, 100 percent. You will realize there is a problem. You will realize something is amiss. You will realize that something is not quite right. You will realize the transactional system does not work in this case. You will realize that "if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another-I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants."<sup>15</sup> You will realize that his love is infinitely favoring us despite our weakness. And this is how he wants us to love our spouse and to love each other. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Love is not about measuring what we give or get or what others give or get. Love is about serving and loving, continually, infinitely, and selflessly, despite imperfections, and because of imperceptions. Love is a person. It is not a technique, nor a book, nor a ratio. It is infinite, and beyond count. Love is not about fairness. I do not believe the Atonement was fair to the Lord; I think it was hugely to our advantage that he performed the Atonement. We cannot repay, nor count all the ways in which He sustains you from breath to breath. In fact, if we were to count our blessings, and name them one by one, we would find ourselves in a constant state of genuine gratitude, without end. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We love him. We take his name upon us because He first loved us. I know that the Lord, when performing the Atonement, did not ask: "What's in it for me?" Instead, He chose to love God and He chose to love you, in spite of your faults. You and I are only beggars at the mercy seat. Let us love our spouse, our families, as the Lord loves. Let us love others, despite of their faults. Let us get rid of the egocentric, selfish, ratio-like, and finite kinds of deceptive loves; the kinds of deceptive loves that are self-serving and that have an end. Said President Dieter F. Uchtdorf:<sup></sup> <sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Those who are selfish seek their own interests and pleasure above all else. The central question for the selfish person is "What's in it for me?"...I am sure you can see that this attitude is clearly contrary to the spirit required to build God's kingdom...Those who wholeheartedly turn their lives over to our Savior and serve God and fellowman discover a richness and fullness to life that the selfish or egotistic will never experience.<sup>16</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the face of the Atonement, the "I deserve" and the "you owe me" or "you failed me" mentality is simply bankrupt. If you find yourself having this mentality, I simply ask that you stop. Stop it. Stop it now. Stop. And instead, let us take counsel from Sister Gilbert who taught that part of the answer to loving others is in our ability to sacrifice and serve others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a cautionary note, you and I may find ourselves in an abusive or oppressive relationship. I believe that nurturing such relationships is nurturing darkness. Something has to change. It is perhaps a sign of great love or great courage for an abused person to step out of such a relationship to help the oppressor work his way to kindness with the help of ecclesiastical, professional, and judicial authorities. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Letter</strong></p>
<p>As you have felt the love of our Savior through the Atonement, I would like to invite you to let your voice be heard. Let it be heard through the letters you could write for the sake of that love you have felt. Letters have a powerful effect on people. Letters can do much do dissipate enmity. Letters can do much to sustain liberty. For example, the New Testament is full of letters written from Apostles. You will also find great letters within the Book of Mormon. You have enjoyed a letter today from Alphonse Daudet's "Letters from my windmill," where villagers did not choose misplaced enmity; they, instead, chose to love. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And this is my invitation for you today. I hope that you will have the courage to write an old-school letter, a throwback letter, the kind which requires a stamp. Let it be a kind letter. Let it be a thoughtful letter. Let it be a simple letter to someone that has blessed your life or the lives of the children of God. It may be the first time you write such a letter. This sincere letter will do much to bless the lives of those who will receive it. Be sure to make it personal by presenting your name and your background, and by addressing the letter to the person directly, by name. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The students I teach have had the courage to write such letters, and have sent them to all kinds of people, including heads of corporations that are doing good humanitarian work in the world. On occasion, they get a response back, a very positive letter of sincere gratitude. We need to be active in supporting the Christ-impulse that so many other people, so many other organizations, so many other cultures, and so many other religions have. Let us crowd out the voice of filth and of misplaced enmity with the voice of God-your voice. Let us work against the dividing of this world.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>On a different occasion, a BYU-I student went back to her home in Texas for the summer a few years ago. She was looking forward to seeing conference on her local cable TV. To her chagrin, the conference proceedings were canceled by the carrier and replaced with another program. Now, this student is just like you, a young person navigating the waters of higher education. She, however, had learned to let her voice be heard, so she wrote to the service company and addressed the decision maker in a kind but graciously firm way. To her surprise, the conference proceedings were put back on the schedule. What a blessing this was to her, and to whomever happened to venture on that channel during conference time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the letter of the Declaration of Independence was dated July 4<sup>th</sup>, and sent with a cover letter on July 6<sup>th</sup>, from Philadelphia, and addressed to the British Authorities. That is a two day span. Today is May 24<sup>th</sup>, perhaps you send your first letter on May 26<sup>th</sup>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you have heard the voice of the Lord at this devotional today. His voice may not have come through anything I may have said. But if His voice came to you today, I plead with you to follow it. I plead with you to rise, as women and men of God, and do it. Remember this, it is through weakness that we find the space to serve one another, let us not use this space to create misplaced enmity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mary Anne and I are honored to be here this afternoon for this wonderful assignment. I am in the process of writing my personal history. I have entitled one of the chapters, "Look What She Did With Me." Mary Anne is one of the greatest blessings of my life.<br /><br /> Whom you choose to marry will have such a great impact on your future as you build a home and family. I am glad she saw some potential in me and was willing to take a chance. We graduated from BYU on May 29, 1970, and we were married a week later on June 5<sup>th</sup> in the Idaho Falls Temple. It has been a wonderful journey for both of us. Much more wonderful than either of us ever imagined.</p>
<p>I grew up in Rexburg. I attended Rick's College-now BYU-Idaho. I had wonderful teachers, and my years here were filled with rich experiences. Likewise, I am sure you have marvelous teachers and are making meaningful memories. President Gilbert and his family are a great blessing to you. Find a way to learn from them and from everyone you associate with here.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I was invited by our granddaughter, Rachelle, to speak to her seminary class at Woods Cross High School. We spent a wonderful hour together. That day I was asked one of the best questions that I have ever been asked. That question was: "What do you know now that you wish you had known at my age?" Today, I would like to share with you some great truths that I know now that I wish I had known at your age. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Most Important Organization in Time and Eternity is the Family, and at the Core of that Organization is Marriage. </strong></p>
<p>President Russell M. Nelson taught: "While salvation is an individual matter, exaltation is a family matter. Only those who are married in the temple and whose marriage is sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise will receive the highest degree of celestial glory, or exaltation...All church activities, advancements, quorums, and classes are a means to the end of an exalted family...The earth was created and this Church was restored so that families could be formed, sealed, and exalted eternally."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> </sup></p>
<p><strong></strong> And President Howard W. Hunter added: "No blessing, including eternal marriage and an eternal family, will be denied to any worthy individual. While it may take somewhat longer, perhaps even beyond this mortal life, for some to achieve this blessing, it will not be denied."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a></sup><strong></strong></p>
<p>Lorenzo Snow taught us the importance of being sealed in the temple. He said: "When two Latter-day Saints are united together in marriage, promises are made to them concerning their offspring that reach from eternity to eternity. What else could man wish? A man and a woman in the other life, having celestial bodies, free from sickness and disease, glorified and beautiful beyond description, standing in the midst of their posterity, governing and controlling them, administering life, exaltation and glory, worlds without end."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In light of these teachings, we must understand our primary purpose is to form an eternal family. Now is the time for you to be establishing or preparing for an eternal marriage.</p>
<p>One of the keys to a great marriage is to include the Savior in your relationship. That starts when you become serious in the dating process. Let me share a poem by Perry Tanksley, entitled "Marriage Takes Three." &nbsp;</p>
<p>I once thought marriage took <br />Just two to make it go. <br />But now I am convinced <br />It takes the Lord also. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And not one marriage fails <br />Where Christ is asked to enter, <br />As lovers come together <br />With Jesus at the center. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But marriage seldom thrives <br />And homes are incomplete, <br />'Til He is welcomed there <br />To help avoid defeat. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In homes where Christ is first, <br />It's obvious to see, <br />Those unions really work. <br />For marriage - it takes three.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me share with you what I would have done differently if I had understood this great truth before I married and had a family. In the white, blank pages in the front and back of my scriptures, I would have written at the top: "The most important organization in time and eternity is the family." Then, I would have looked around at the people I knew and I would have carefully observed the great marriages and great families that I admired. I would have taken the time to meet with the parents of those great families<strong> </strong>and asked for suggestions on how to create a great marriage and a great family like they had. What advice did they have for me? What specific practices and traditions did they have in their families that helped them to be strong? I would have listened to their wisdom, and I would have recorded it in my scriptures.&nbsp;Then I would have reviewed that list regularly.</p>
<p>Had I done this, I would have had a better understanding early in our marriage of how to be a better husband and father. I would not have made so many mistakes. There are too many divorces in this world, and there are things we can do to fix that problem. Alma said: "By small and simple things are great things brought to pass."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a></sup><strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Developing Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and Living a Christ-centered Life are Divine Principles</strong></p>
<p>As taught in <em>Preach My Gospel</em>: "Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the first principle of the Gospel. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God, and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son's grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a><strong> </strong></sup> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>"Faith leads to action, including repentance, obedience, and dedicated service. When you have faith in Jesus Christ, you trust the Lord enough to follow His commandments-even when you do not completely understand the reasons for them. You accomplish what the Lord wants you to accomplish. You help bring about good in your own life and the lives of others. You are able to do miracles according to the Lord's will. Your faith will be made manifest through diligence and work."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a> </sup></p>
<p><strong></strong> There is an important reason why faith is the first principle of the gospel. Faith establishes the conduit of communication between you and heaven. With that line of communication wide open, your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ can guide you to a Christ-centered, celestial life. The process begins with your personal application of the teachings of the Savior.</p>
<p>Last year, I had the opportunity to participate in the reorganization of three single adult stakes. During the weekend of each Stake Conference, we spent Saturday morning visiting five apartments in each of those stakes. Not one apartment had a picture of Christ in their living room. Not one was having apartment prayer or scripture study, or family home evening. We taught them the importance of being Christ-centered in every facet of their lives-especially in their apartments.</p>
<p>One of the apartments we visited included one new convert, two returned missionaries, and one student who had been less-active. The new convert saw me in the Sunday session of stake conference and said, "I have never felt closer to my roommates than when we read the Book of Mormon and prayed together last night. The Spirit was in our apartment." Do you want the Spirit to reside in your home or apartment? Do you hold apartment or family prayer? Do you read the scriptures together? This is the perfect time to begin these practices that you will apply in your family and home.</p>
<p>A while ago, Mary Anne and I had the opportunity to attend an art show at BYU featuring famous artists and their paintings of the Savior.</p>
<p>This painting by Heinrich Hoffman, called "Portrait of Christ," hangs in our living room. It is the same painting that President Monson has hung on the wall across from his desk. He looks at it often and asks: "What would He do?"</p>
<p>Heinrich Hoffman commented about this painting, "Originally I had painted it for myself, and only because of the persuasion of friends I exhibited it in my studio. I wanted to hang it over my bed and when I went to rest in the evening, it should look at me, earnestly scrutinizing, and ask: 'Have you lived this day in my spirit according to my commandments?'" After he sold the painting in 1904, Hoffmann commented that he felt as though "something sacred was missing" and felt, as he said "the absence of my Savior's eyes looking at me."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[viii]</a> </sup></p>
<p>Having a picture of Christ in our living rooms will help us to live lives that are Christ-centered.<strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Companionship of the Holy Ghost is the Greatest Gift That Mortal Man Can Enjoy</strong></p>
<p>Throughout my life, I have come to understand that the companionship of the Holy Ghost is the greatest gift that mortal man can enjoy. One of the most important things you can do at this moment of your life is learn to listen to the Holy Ghost and follow Him.</p>
<p>In an interview on the Mormon Channel, Elder Craig A. Cardon of the Seventy, shared the following: "From the time of the birth of our first child, present in every prayer that we offered was a plea that our children would learn to recognize the voice of the Lord and have the courage to respond to it. My role as a father was to help them connect with their Eternal Father. To remind them that He would always be there."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[ix]</a></sup>&nbsp;This is our prayer for each of you today: that you will learn to recognize the voice of the Holy Ghost and have the courage to respond to it.</p>
<p>The Savior promised the Twelve the gift of the Holy Ghost as recorded in the book of John: "But when the&nbsp;Comforter&nbsp;is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,&nbsp;even&nbsp;the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall&nbsp;testify&nbsp;of me"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><em><strong>[x]</strong></em></a></sup><em> </em>"Without this gift, they were not ready for their ministries and all they would face."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[xi]</a></sup><strong> </strong>If we do not learn how to listen to and follow the Holy Ghost, we will not reach the Celestial Kingdom. We live in a difficult world and the Holy Ghost will help keep us safe, and on the path back to the presence of the Father and the Son.<em></em></p>
<p>The Holy Ghost is the Testator, Revelator, Sanctifier, Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit of Promise, Spirit of Truth, Messenger of the Father and the Son. Parley P. Pratt said this about the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The gift of the Holy Ghost quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands, and purifies all the natural passions and affections, and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use. It inspires, develops, cultivates, and matures all the fine-toned sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings, and affections of our nature. It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness, and charity. It develops beauty of person, form, and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation, and social feeling. It invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[xii]</a> </sup></p>
<p><strong></strong> What great power the Holy Ghost has! Does this give us a vision of what the Holy Ghost can do for us? I recently made a list of some things the Holy Ghost can help us with:</p>
<p>By the power of the Holy Ghost, a person receives a testimony of Jesus Christ, His work, and the work of His servants.</p>
<p>He is a cleansing agent.</p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales states that "the Holy Ghost provides personal revelation to help us make major life decisions about such things as education, missions, marriage, children, where we will live...and so on."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[xiii]</a></sup> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He brings hope and comfort.</p>
<p>Melanie Wellman tells a story in the <em>Liahona</em> entitled, "Who Needs My Help?"</p>
<p>"As a college student, I heard a wonderful Relief Society lesson on service. The teacher said, 'If you pray for Heavenly Father to open your eyes to the needs of others so you can help them, He will do so.'"</p>
<p>"That sentence stayed with me. I wanted to serve others but hadn't thought to ask Heavenly Father for help. So, I decided to give it a try. The next morning I knelt and prayed, 'Heavenly Father, if there is anyone who needs my help today, please let me know.' I finished my prayer and headed to class."</p>
<p>"Amid the hustle of the day, I forgot my prayer. During the afternoon I went to the grocery store. As I stood in line to pay for my groceries, I noticed an elderly woman who used a cane for support. I smiled at her and glanced at the groceries she was buying. I thought, '<em>How is she going to get those groceries into her house?'"</em></p>
<p>"With some frustration I countered, '<em>But what can I do? Follow her home?' '</em>I had an immediate strong feeling that this idea was correct, so I gave in and drove down the road after her. I kept thinking, '<em>This is crazy! Why am I following this woman home?'</em> Soon we arrived at her apartment complex. I ran over to her and asked, 'Can I help you with these groceries?'"</p>
<p>"Puzzled, the woman looked at me and asked if I lived nearby. I told her I did not. 'Do you work here?' she asked."</p>
<p>"I explained that I had seen her in the grocery store and had worried about how she would carry all those groceries into her home. At that point she looked up at me with tears in her eyes and said, 'I was wondering the entire way home how I was going to get my groceries into my home.'"</p>
<p>"Later, as she drove home, Sister Wellman's eyes blurred with tears. She had experienced the wonderful influence of the Holy Ghost touching two lives."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[xiv]</a> </sup></p>
<p>To have the Holy Ghost active in our lives requires specific things:</p>
<p>Last Sunday, as we partook of the sacrament, we heard these words "always remember Him and keep His commandments...that they may always have His Spirit to be with them."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[xv]</a>&nbsp;</sup>What happens during the sacrament and sacrament meeting is important in our relationship with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>I received the following letter from Elder Lazcano, a missionary serving in Argentina: "I am writing to share with you the miracles that the Lord has done that have changed my life. While you were in Panama you said to me, 'Write down what the Spirit teaches you as you study <em>Preach My Gospel</em>.' Thanks to you, the principle of revelation has been planted deeply in my heart."</p>
<p>"When I had been on my mission for only six months, I was called as a trainer. One day my new companion asked me, 'Why do you have your planner and a little book under your pillow?' I told him, 'Because I write down what I learn from the Holy Ghost during the night.' He didn't seem to understand what I meant."</p>
<p>"That night my companion woke up in the middle of the night and saw me sitting at the table, writing in my planner. He asked, 'Elder Lazcano, what are you doing?' I told him, 'I am recording revelation.' My companion was touched and he knew by the Spirit that this principle was true. From that evening on, we each wrote what we learned from the Holy Ghost and worked hard to live according to what we had been told. Elder Clarke, I know that the Lord speaks to us. This work is true."</p>
<p>I have a book of inspiration that I carry with me. I have learned that the Holy Ghost will always teach me. If I write down the promptings and do what He directs, He keeps talking to me. Do you have a book of inspiration? <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>We Should Spend Time on the Things That Matter Most</strong></p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales recently said: "When you cannot do what you have always done, then you only do what matters most."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[xvi]</a></sup></p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks said it in his way: "We have to forego some good things in order to choose others that are better or best because they develop faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthen our families."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[xvii]</a> </sup></p>
<p>In my life, I have learned that spending time on the most important things really does matter. If we are not careful, we will spend time on things that don't really matter and many times things that will be harmful.</p>
<p>We all have 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and how we use that time will determine our success and happiness in this life and in the life to come. The following quotes may help us in our journey to do the most important things with our time:</p>
<p>As we learn to use our time wisely, we learn that diligence is more important than intelligence. Chapter 8 in <em>Preach My Gospel</em> has many great truths and practices on how to prioritize your time and set goals. Steve Allen, director of the Missionary Department, shared the following experience with me:</p>
<p>"A few years ago, I attended a mission presidents' seminar in Burbank, California. The local mission president had arranged for two of his proselyting missionaries to drive me from the chapel to the Burbank Airport on a Saturday afternoon. When I got into the vehicle, I noticed that the junior companion was seated in the back seat and seemed to be disconnected from the world. The driver, who had been out for about 18 months, saw his task as being a chauffeur. Neither of these missionaries knew that I was the managing director of the Missionary Department. They simply viewed themselves as taxi drivers. We had 15 minutes until we would arrive at the airport."</p>
<p>"I prayed and asked Heavenly Father if there would be some way that I could connect with these two missionaries, particularly the driver. I felt impressed to ask him if I could look at his planner. He nonchalantly handed me the planner and kept driving. In glancing through the planner, it was very clear that he was using it simply as a scheduling tool and that he did not understand chapter eight of <em>Preach My Gospel</em>. I thanked him, handed back his planner and prayed again." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"In a few moments, I felt impressed to ask him this question: 'Elder Smith (not his real name), if I were to share with you an idea, which if you followed, would earn you three to four times more money over the course of your lifetime than you were going to make, would you be interested? For example, if over the course of your lifetime, you are going to earn $10 million, this idea will help you earn $30 million.' He thought about it for a moment and then responded by restating my question, 'You have an idea that if I do it, it will earn me three to four more times more money over the course of my lifetime than I am going to make?' 'Yes.' He responded, 'Yes, I would be interested.'"</p>
<p>"I said, 'I am willing to share this idea with you on one condition, that you promise me you will do exactly what I teach you.' This caused some pause on his part, and when he finally responded, with about nine minutes to go to the airport, he said, 'So, you have an idea, that if I do it and I promise you I will do it, that it will earn me three to four times more money over the course of my lifetime. But you won't share it with me unless I promise to do it, correct?' 'Correct.' He again thought about it for several minutes and said, 'Alright, I promise. I will do exactly what you say.' And so I told him that it was obvious from his planner that he does not understand chapter eight of <em>Preach My Gospel</em>. I told him that it was developed by a very skilled team of people who understand how to use time wisely and that it has been hailed by many professional people as one of the finest pieces of work on the topic."</p>
<p>"I invited him, beginning that day, to reread <em>Preach My Gospel</em> chapter eight and make a list of all the principles in the chapter. Then, to begin living the principles with exactness. I said, 'Your goal is to become a <em>Preach My Gospel</em> chapter eight missionary. If it says to do something in that chapter, you do it. Make it a part of who you are. If you do this and apply it to your life, you will earn three to four times more money than you are going to on your current course.' He said that he would do it and we parted company."</p>
<p>"I did not expect to hear back from Elder Smith, but about seven or eight months later, I received a letter from him, thanking me for that invitation. He said he had done exactly as he promised. He studied chapter eight and had indeed become a <em>Preach My Gospel</em> chapter eight missionary. He said his only regret was that he had wasted the first 18 months of his mission without this experience. He said the last six months were glorious, and there was no question in his mind that he will earn at least three to four times more money than he would have; but more importantly, he has learned how to set goals, make plans, be accountable, and achieve at a much higher level than before."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-don-r-clarke#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[xviii]</a></sup></p>
<p>On this journey to become like the Father and His Son, we need to spend our time on that which matters most or on the best things.</p>
<p>Forming celestial habits and obeying Christ's teachings is not easy. We need to remember:<br /><br /></p>
<p>These truths will help us on our journey to return and live with the Father and the Son.</p>

<p>Counselor, Counseling Center</p>
<p>Sister Couliard grew up in Rennes, France. She was baptized into the church at age sixteen along with her older sister, two years after her mother was converted to the restored Gospel. After finishing college, she went to work and saved up her money to resume her studies at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.</p>
<p>Sister Couliard holds degrees in consumer science with an emphasis in social work, psychology and marriage and family therapy. She graduated with her PhD in marriage and family therapy from BYU in 1990.&nbsp; She has devoted her professional life primarily to university students through her counseling center career at Utah State University in Logan, Utah and at BYU-Idaho since 2005. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>She currently serves as the Young Women president in the Rexburg 8<sup>th</sup> ward. During her years of service in the Church she has been a primary teacher, a Relief Society president, counselor, teacher, and a gospel doctrine instructor. She served a full-time mission in the Washington Seattle mission from 1984 to 1985. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Couliard enjoys traveling abroad. Last August, she worked as a volunteer in orphanages in Cuenca, Ecuador.&nbsp; She also finds fulfillment in being a daughter, a sister, an aunt, and a friend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her dream is to one day live in a warm climate with lots of sunshine all year long!</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p>Someone pointed out to me that in the last five weeks, three French nationals have spoken at devotional, Bishop Causs&eacute;, Brother Delton and myself. My dear friends, if this trend continues, you will need to learn a few key phrases, such as: "Bonjour" (hello), "Merci" (thank you), and "S'il-vous-pla&icirc;t, o&ugrave; sont les toilettes?" (please, where are the restrooms?).<br /><br /> &nbsp; It is a great honor and equally a remarkable responsibility to address you, the youth of Zion, in this impressive conference center. I have labored in body and spirit to know what I should share with you. Interestingly, what I chose to speak on months ago was the very topic of another recent BYU-Idaho devotional. It is certain that the Lord has a purpose in teaching his children by repetition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I grew up in a fairly large city in western France. That's where I took driver's ed. The first few times driving alone, I felt considerable trepidation venturing into heavy traffic, especially on narrow streets. On the screen is a restored model of the popular Citro&euml;n 2CV, which is the type of car my family owned in those days. I learned to drive swiftly, in order to avoid getting hit, squished, yelled at, or simply to get a parking spot. As you all know, driving in Rexburg, Idaho, is a totally different experience and though I have mellowed out behind the wheel, occasionally old habits return. Such was the case about a year ago when, running late for work, I found myself having to stop for a moment behind a row of cars while the stop light above menaced to turn red one more time. I got a little irked, thought a few bad things about Idaho drivers; I even honked my horn. Eventually, traffic picked up and I made it through the intersection. Then, I realized what the matter was. To my surprise, I saw a man wearing dark glasses crossing the street holding a white cane in front of him and accompanied by a vested dog heeling next to him. "A blind man!" I shamefully whispered to myself. Immediately, my attitude did a 180 and I was overcome with compassion for that man and respect for the other patient drivers. Later, I thought to myself: How is it possible to be irritated and impatient one second and the next, be moved by gratitude and good will? &nbsp;</p>
<p>President David O. McKay told us how. He explained that because of the fall we have a dual nature<sup>1</sup>: "One, related to the earthly or animal life; the other, akin to the Divine."<sup>2</sup> For survival, our animal nature is devoted to our comfort and propels us toward pleasing our physical senses. Conversely, it avoids that which is not pleasurable. Not unlike an untrained puppy that runs through the house chewing on everything that looks like a bone, or not. If left untamed, our hedonistic, earthly nature can lead us to misuse our God-given body by surrendering it to the whims of the flesh. For most humans, the animal nature is the path of least resistance. On the other hand, our divine nature comes from God. As his literal spirit children, our Father in Heaven communicates to us through the divinity within us. I believe our greatest challenge in this life is to protect our bodies and minds from submitting to the earthly in us, thus becoming what the scriptures call the natural man. Note that the challenge is not to eliminate our earthly nature, which is here to stay, but to school and bridle it while developing our divine nature. "The natural man (or woman) is an enemy to God,"<sup>3 </sup>because he is carnal and dismisses God's laws in order to satisfy his personal needs; a dangerous proposition with negative consequences both spiritual and physical. However, there is hope for all of us who have surrendered to the natural side. By yielding to light and truth, which is found in the Holy Spirit, we can be changed, putting off that which is natural, and becoming sons and daughters of God. In that process, our bodies and minds are purified and enlightened. They become instruments to create a more beautiful world not only in the physical sense, but also in our relationships with God, others and ourselves. Parley P. Pratt taught, "The gift of the Holy Spirit...expands and purifies all the natural passions and affections; and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use."<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's typical to associate the concept of the natural man with major sins such as immorality, substance abuse, attachment to material wealth in any of its forms, or the gross neglect of the poor. Although identifying with the natural side can lead to serious transgressions, it does not always, at least not at first. After all, it does not appear too grievous to treat others unkindly once in a while, or is it? Without efforts on our part and with the unequivocal support the adversary gives him, the natural man in us will develop and eventually disable us as to righteousness. Wrote Elder Neal A. Maxwell, "Unless the natural man is put off, he will finally put us down."<sup>5</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me give you a few examples of how our natural tendencies contribute to our daily misery. Going back to my story of being late for work. That morning, I was driving under the influence, not of alcohol, but of the impure desire of wanting to get ahead with little concern for the drivers in front of or behind me. The natural woman is only worried about herself. And with hindsight, those thoughts and feelings made me tense and tired before I even got to work! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Vulnerable teenagers and young adults easily fall prey to comparing themselves negatively to peers, seemingly perfect friends on social media, or the "ideal" as dictated by societal pressures. They may demonstrate intolerance of themselves, harsh criticism, and extreme perfectionism. The natural man who likes approval and fears the judgment of others, will put himself down if he doesn't comply with expectations. Utter discouragement may also creep in. Giving up on oneself comes easily to the natural man<sup>6</sup> who does not see one's potential, and does not know how to give love and aid in times of disquietude. In stressful situations, all that he wants is to retaliate or run away. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's watch together a <a href="https://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/mormon-messages/lifes-drama">clip from Mormon Messages</a> featuring a moment in the life of a congenial fellow who happens to be a father, an employee and an amateur actor in his free time. Let's see if you can quickly pick up on this man's natural habits.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>What was Mike's automatic reply every time someone asked for accountability? "It's not my fault!" The natural man does not take responsibility, seeking first his personal gratification. Imagine what would happen if Mike never changed? By and by, his relationships at work, at home, and at play would deteriorate to the point of compromising his employment and the respect of others, especially his family. By the way, Mike did turn around and you can find out how by viewing the complete message online. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.<sup>3</sup><sup></sup></p>
<p>Who is this powerful being we call Christ? In Doctrine and Covenants 45, the Lord solemnly declared who He is and what He does: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For verily I say unto you that I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the light and the life of the world-a light that shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not. I came unto my own, and mine own received me not; but unto as many as received me gave I power to do many miracles, and to become the sons of God; and even unto them that believed on my name gave I power to obtain eternal life.<sup>7</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of our Lord's Atonement, Elder Kim B. Clark declared from this very pulpit: "There is no sin, no guilt, no shame, no fear, no loneliness, no heartache, no loss, no depression, no sadness, no terror, no pain, no challenge, no weakness that Jesus has not experienced and overcome. He has all power over all things."<sup>8</sup> <sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>What do you think? Can Christ the Lord be trusted? Do you think He knows how to assist you in putting off your sins, imperfections, and other natural delusions? I testify that He is completely trustworthy. He has proven His loyalty to me time and time again. I testify that His love, devotion and power are unfailing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think "put off" is an interesting and noteworthy choice of words. King Benjamin did not say to kill, blow up, trash, burn or any other brutal directive which would give a whole new tone to his admonition. To the woman taken in adultery who the scribes and Pharisees were about to stone to death, Jesus said firmly and lovingly, "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."<sup>9</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Many years ago, when I was still in college, I started hanging out with the wrong friends and mimicking some of their behaviors, which could have taken me out of the safety zone of my baptismal covenants. One day, as I was saying goodbye to my friends, there came to my mind words that were spoken to me, and although they weren't audible they were as clear as if they had been. The tone was stern, kind, without condemnation and had a protective intent to it. It was the Spirit of the Lord, which said, addressing me: "This is not your place," meaning the path my friends had invited me to take. That was all. I followed that counsel and saved myself a lot of trouble. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord understands us. He experienced the dual nature himself<em> </em>although His beautiful divine spirit prevailed. However<em>,</em> through manipulative maneuvers, Satan attacked the Lord with temptations of the flesh and the mind when Jesus was hungry and tired. Although it is hard to know exactly how much He suffered from those evil acts of aggression toward Him, the scripture testifies that He endured them throughout His ministry.<sup>10 </sup>Not long before His death, He said the following to His apostles: "Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations."<sup>11</sup> And Paul confirmed that He "...was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."<sup>12</sup> Jesus has perfect empathy for us, having the bowels of mercy; being filled with compassion toward the children of men.<sup>13</sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Lord has compassion for us, whom He died for, sacrificing all because of His love for us, shouldn't we have compassion toward ourselves for being human? If your young child who fears doctors, bursts into tears at the sight of the needle when getting his immunization shots, you and the nurse don't yell at him or call him names, do you? No! As a parent, you provide reassurance and seek to know what you can do to alleviate your child's anxiety while the nurse adds clear instructions and follows protocol. Likewise, we have been given a clear way to bring us back from breaking God's law. That pathway is repentance. But let's not neglect the need for understanding and kindness toward ourselves.<sup>14</sup> I encourage you to exert patience and compassion for yourselves when facing your imperfections. This is especially important when struggles are complex, multi-facetted, and involving more than one player. Many of my students get exasperated and angry at themselves for being less virtuous than they had hoped. This attitude is comparable to pouring pickle juice on a finger paper cut, or fanning blazing flames.<sup>15</sup> The natural man cannot be put off with more of his own foibles. Only light overcomes darkness. Be kind with yourself, seek to understand, without judging, what the trouble is. Repent if you need to, and then, strive to do better. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Concretely, how can we put off the natural man through the Atonement of Jesus Christ? What may that process look like? &nbsp;</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must recognize we have become natural in some facet of our lives. It is easier said than done as the natural man himself is a self-deception, meaning we feel justified being in our natural man state. Our complaints appear legitimate to us. Let me introduce a recently married couple, Chuck and Savannah, to you. This couple does not exist, but is a composite of dozens of young people who seek help with their relationships. Savannah is often angry at her husband and holds him responsible for hurting her feelings. From her vantage point, it seems completely reasonable to blame him for her unhappiness. In response, she typically shuts him out. Then, Chuck too gets annoyed and openly puts the blame back on Savannah for making his life difficult. "Could this be the dark side of marriage no one warned us about?" They both wondered. In a sense, yes, because at that point, their marriage was dominated by two young and strong egos jousting, colliding and colluding with each other. A pattern of relationship defeat constitutes blatant signals that the natural man is in charge, and charging onto the battlefield. With help and humble prayer, Chuck and Savannah began looking inside themselves, something that is unnatural to the reactionary natural man. To their surprise, they each realized their animosity and hostility were only reflections of their own unresolved issues, unmet needs, and personal buried insecurities. They immediately began working on what was amiss in them and needed healing. Eventually, realizing their own and each other's humanness, their blaming stopped all together. Forgiveness budded, then blossomed and so did their love for one another. When you look inside yourself, do so with curiosity, humility, and an open mind; invite the Lord to accompany you in your reflection. Then, watch how darkness dissipates as the light of your humble gaze shines upon it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you suspect some aspect of you may have been hijacked by your natural self, but you are perplexed as to the source of your problem, you can ask your Father in Heaven for the gift of discernment that you may know where to look. In a talk, entitled "What Lack I Yet?<sup>"16 </sup>Elder Larry R. Lawrence encouraged us to ask the Lord in prayer that He may reveal to us the things we do that impede our progression. A young person who never seemed to be the right man for any of the women he dated, humbly approached the Lord and asked what he might do differently. The Lord told the young man to clean up his language.<sup>16</sup> Said Elder Lawrence, "The Holy Ghost really does give customized counsel. He is a completely honest companion and will tell us things that no one else knows or has the courage to say."<sup>16</sup> You may think those little behavioral changes are too simple to address your major life's burdens, but Elder Lawrence continues, "The Holy Ghost doesn't tell us to improve everything at once. If He did, we would become discouraged and give up. The Spirit works with us at our own speed, one step at a time."<sup>16 </sup>As the young adult in that story heeded the inspired advice, his life improved. Little changes can produce larger ones. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The story does not say exactly how answers come. The Holy Ghost inspires us in multiple sorts of ways, tailored to our circumstances, temperaments, and stages of development. Answers can come by direct revelation during prayer or through priesthood blessings, but most often, they come through seemingly mundane means such as a scripture that stands out during morning study, a conversation with a friend or a teacher, a particularly potent therapy session, a flash of memory, a trial, some ironic set of circumstances, someone's loving support, or a calling. Answers can come suddenly, over time, or one step at a time.<sup>17</sup> Whichever shape they take, the same business card is left at our door. One that reads the following penetrating words: "It is I. I love you."<sup>18</sup> With time, our ability to distinguish divine intervention increases. We are also able to recognize another precious blessing. That of knowing God answers prayers through the Holy Ghost and that the gospel works in the details of our lives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, we can ask for any specific gift of the spirit that we might need in order to progress. For example, the gifts of patience, fortitude, hope, or peace. One of my close friends confided in me about feelings of envy she had harbored for several years toward a member of her own family. Eventually, she prayed with all the sincerity of her soul for the gift of charity. Diligently, she turned to God whenever the dreaded feelings would rise in her, and she purposefully stopped talking negatively about her relative to others. Although it took many steps spread over at least half a year, she eventually said to me, "I love my family member and no longer envy that person." What a victory over the flesh! She shared with me how grateful she felt for the Savior and his marvelous influence in her life. As she put forth her own efforts, climbed over the adversary's snares of discouragement along the way, the Lord orchestrated all the rest and He endowed her with power. You and Christ are made to be a team. Jesus Christ is The Comforter. Comforter comes from two Latin words: "com," which means with or together, and "fortis," which means strong. In other words, with Him we are strong.<sup>19</sup> To His covenant children, Christ says "...I will show unto you my strong reasoning...let me show unto you even my wisdom."<sup>20 </sup>As you try your best and ask for His power to enable you, your very nature eventually changes. Furthermore, your testimony of Him expands. Your trust that together-with Him-you can do whatever is expedient for you to accomplish becomes rock solid.<sup></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The natural man's imaginations can be deeply rooted in the psyche because they stem from physical and tangible earthly experiences that leave neurological marks on the brain. Consequently, it may be quite a challenge to put off negative habits of the mind and of the body. For example, someone may understand the need to forgive a friend that offended them, but has not been able to do so, in spite of significant exertion and notable decrease in their overall sense of wellbeing. A few months ago, as I was pondering one of my student's seemingly intractable natural man's beliefs and habits and wondering how such a young person could overcome his predicament, I was directed to a website where I heard the kind voice of President Henry B. Eyring, declare: "Moroni, the son of Mormon in the Book of Mormon, told us how. He teaches the simple and sweet truth that acting on even a twig of faith allows God to grow it. That particle of faith most precious, and which you should protect and use to whatever extent you can, is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ."<sup>21 </sup>My heart was relieved as I was reminded that the combination of age and experience is not a prerequisite for beginning to overcome challenges. You can start exercising faith at any age and in any circumstance. If you don't have much faith, then start with the desire to have faith. By and by, day by day, He will lead you to the right people and the right tools that are necessary for you to overcome or come to terms with your problem. Because this process takes time, be patient and keep at it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As we earnestly work on putting off the natural man the Lord's way, which is to enlist his divine assistance, something extraordinary and wonderful happens. We begin to know first-hand that He lives, and that He knows, understands, and loves us individually. What a precious gift that is! Furthermore, as we begin to walk with Him and receive a remission of our sins and transgressions no matter how small they are, peace fills our hearts. The Savior said: "Learn of me and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me."<sup>22 </sup>Our desire to follow Him begins to swell within. We become more fervent in our willingness to keep all of His commandments, more able to be taught from above and from those who have wisdom and truth where ever it may be found. We become sponges to all that is praiseworthy and certainly, above all, we become more loving and charitable toward our fellowmen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. I know He is the Holy Messiah, the Redeemer of the World. My testimony started modest, as expected. With the years, it has grown by leaps and bounds. From personal experience, I know that He makes us clean again when we repent of our sins. I also know that He runs to our rescue as if we were the only one in the world, when, due to our earthly nature and/or someone else's sins and transgressions, we have become lost, confused and broken but seek to be healed and made whole by Him and through Him. I testify that He is real. He is powerful. He loves us. My desire for you is that you may discover for yourselves the impact of His love and power in your life in small and weighty matters. May your trust in Him flourish as the years go by. I pray that all of us may continue to strive to put off the natural man and, through His grace, become sons and daughters of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp;</p>

<p>General Authority Seventy</p>
<p>Elder Von G. Keetch was sustained as a General Authority Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 4, 2015, at age 55. At the time of his call he had been serving as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy in the Salt Lake City Area and as chief outside counsel to the Church.<br /><br />Elder Keetch received a bachelor's degree in political science from Brigham Young University in 1984. In 1987, he received a juris doctorate degree from the J. Reuben Clark Law School at Brigham Young University. During 1988 and 1989, Elder Keetch served as a judicial clerk to Judge George C. Pratt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Subsequently, he served as a judicial clerk to Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Antonin Scalia of the United States Supreme Court. He practiced law at Kirton McConkie from 1990 to 2015. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Keetch has served in a number of Church callings, including full-time missionary in the Germany D&uuml;sseldorf Mission, bishop's counselor, stake president's counselor, stake president, and Area Seventy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Keetch is married to Bernice. They are the parents of six children and reside in Highland, Utah.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My dear brothers and sisters: you are an awesome sight. Sister Keetch and I are so honored to be here with you-the next great generation of our world, and particularly of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I want you to know how highly we think of you-all that you do, and more particularly, all that you are.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story is told of a small army unit that was assigned a very difficult mission far behind enemy lines. As they neared their objective, opposing units became aware of their presence. Superior forces quickly encircled them and began firing from all sides. As they found themselves surrounded and began to suffer withering fire, the members of this small army unit looked up to find their commander standing upon a rock, exhorting them. Looking at his men, the commander yelled: "Men, we've got them right where we want them. You can just fire in any direction!"<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You and I also have a difficult mission in today's world. It is to teach and defend the truths contained in the gospel of Jesus Christ. In the world in which we live, I know it can be difficult to understand exactly what the best rules of engagement are, especially when you are surrounded by so many voices that are willing to challenge the truth. There can often be so many barrages from so many different angles that it is difficult to know how to respond. Today, I want to talk with you-and hopefully provide an example to you-about what it means to be what the Apostle Paul called "an example of the believers"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-von-g-keetch#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></sup>-what it means to teach and defend eternal truth in the way that our Heavenly Father desires, while at the same time exemplifying the respect, compassion, and deep love that Christ exemplified. What it means to earnestly defend what we know to be right without just firing indiscriminately in any direction at any perceived enemy. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, it often seems that those two principles are in tension, doesn't it? We are taught that we must fight "against spiritual wickedness"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-von-g-keetch#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></sup> in all of its forms, that we must "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places,"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-von-g-keetch#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></sup> and that we must never be "ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-von-g-keetch#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> </sup>Yet, we are also taught that we should avoid contention and never "stir up the hearts of men with anger"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-von-g-keetch#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></sup>-that we should not just "live peaceably with all men,"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-von-g-keetch#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></sup> but that we should also actively "follow after the things which make for peace."<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-von-g-keetch#_ftn7" title="">[7]</a></sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-von-g-keetch#_ftn7" title=""></a> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, how do we fulfill our God-given charge to stand firm in the gospel and to teach others the truth without causing contention and anger? It seems that, especially in dealing with the controversial issues of the day, saying anything at all quite quickly leads to strife and contention. As you know so well, the world today seems to have very little patience with anyone who wants to express a view that is not consistent with newfound trends. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so today, I would like to acquaint you with a young woman named Samantha. Samantha is a fictional character, but the experiences she portrays are very real and have been lived by many of your generation. We are going to watch her experience in three parts. The first occurs in a university course in which she is enrolled:</p>
<p>[Part 1] <a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/Seeking+Fairness+for+All+-+Part+1/0_2ne8568l" id="LPlnk386060" target="_blank">https://video.byui.edu/media/Seeking+Fairness+for+All+-+Part+1/0_2ne8568l</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you relate to Samantha? There she is, sitting in class, minding her own business, when all of a sudden her entire belief structure is attacked. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When such challenges come, you and I tend to do one of two things. We either sound a hasty retreat, choosing not to engage in an environment that could quite quickly turn uncomfortable or even hostile; or we act just the way Samantha did-becoming defensive in a point/counterpoint debate that is entertaining to watch, but which generates much greater heat than it does light. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you might imagine, after Samantha leaves class that day, she has second thoughts. What should she have done? Is there any way she could have responded to Miki better? And so, presented with an opportunity to talk to her bishop about her experience, she seeks his counsel:</p>
<p>[Part 2]&nbsp;<a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/Seeking+Fairness+for+All+-+Part+2/0_q46r9pp0" target="_blank">https://video.byui.edu/media/Seeking+Fairness+for+All+-+Part+2/0_q46r9pp0</a></p>
<p>Having counseled with her bishop, and more importantly, having studied it out in her own mind and then listened carefully for heavenly direction, Samantha is determined to improve how she left things with Miki. And so she works up her courage and-using the light she has found within herself-she tries again:</p>
<p>[Part 3] <a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/Seeking+Fairness+for+All+-+Part+3/0_qgp2roca" target="_blank">https://video.byui.edu/media/Seeking+Fairness+for+All+-+Part+3/0_qgp2roca</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I point out to you just a few things that I learned from Samantha and Miki that will always be in play as we do our best to teach and defend the word of God, while at the same time showing love and compassion to all people?<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, note that although Samantha and Miki's particular disagreement was centered on one specific set of issues society is currently confronting, the same principles of engagement apply no matter what the issue might be. Whenever there is heated controversy, the best way to proceed is with love, respect, and understanding, while never abandoning the conviction of truth that we hold in our hearts. <br /> Second, Samantha has the most success when she engages Miki one-on-one. In today's polarizing culture with stinging one-liners and perpetual attempts at one-upmanship, little is usually accomplished in large group free-for-alls. That is especially true with social media, where we must be very careful that our comments on a sensitive societal issue do not veer away from the spirit Christ would want us to convey. If we allow ourselves to be limited to 140 characters, we will often be misunderstood. Usually, much more can be accomplished one-on-one, face-to-face, as individuals come to understand each other. That is precisely the way President Monson has taught us that we should reach out and rescue. One by one. And it is most often the way the Savior reached out and touched lives during His ministry on earth. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, although Samantha would undoubtedly have been overjoyed if Miki had seen the light immediately and had agreed to receive the missionaries the next day, that was not Samantha's initial goal. Her initial goal was to understand where Miki was coming from-to respect her as a person and to understand her views. Only then could Samantha effectively communicate with Miki, getting past the sound bites of accusation and misunderstanding that too often dominate our discussions. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, Samantha suggested to Miki a unique method for how the two of them could respect each other's views and still live together in society. In response to Miki's suggestion that the two of them would simply have to live according to their own views without infringing on one another's freedoms, Samantha suggested something better. She suggested to Miki something that is fundamental in a pluralistic society if everyone is to be treated fairly-we must stand up for the basic civil rights of others if we are to expect others to stand up for our basic civil rights. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, understanding one another rarely occurs in a single event. It is a process-one that often can take a good deal of time. At the end of their discussion, Miki certainly did not accept Samantha's views. And it is possible that she never will. But gone from their discussion were words like "bigot" and "hate." Miki saw Samantha, perhaps for the first time, as someone who was intrinsically good and reasonable, even if she holds basic views that Miki herself will never accept.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could go on and on. Indeed, I hope you have made your own mental or written notes about what you witnessed between Samantha and Miki-principles and actions that spoke to your heart, or which might be of help to you in a current difficult situation you are facing. As Paul taught, being "an example of the believers" is much more than just living the principles of the gospel for others to see. Paul tells us specifically that those same gospel principles must be part of our conversation, of our love for others, as part of the spirit we convey, as part of the faith that defines who we are.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end then, when properly understood, there is really no tension between the two great gospel principles of standing up for truth while at the same time respecting and loving others. Our strong conviction of the truth should never cause us to act in a way that is disrespectful or resentful toward others. But at the same time, our desire to show kindness and love to everyone should never undermine our duty to stand for truth. These two principles are really just two sides of the very same coin. On one side of the coin is our duty to explain and firmly defend the doctrine of God. On the other side of that very same coin is our duty to act in a Christlike way, always showing respect and love. Elder Dallin H. Oaks puts it this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our tolerance and respect for others and their beliefs does not cause us to abandon our commitment to the truths we understand and the covenants we have made...We must stand up for truth, even while we practice tolerance and respect for beliefs and ideas different from our own and for the people who hold them. This inspired caution reminds us that for persons who believe in absolute truth, tolerance for behavior is like a two-sided coin. Tolerance or respect is on one side of the coin, but truth is always on the other.<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-von-g-keetch#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My dear brothers and sisters, my friends. In a world that is quickly becoming more polarized and more contentious-where bullets often seem to be coming in rapid-fire staccato from all quarters-may I challenge you to examine both sides of your coin? In each circumstance that arises in your lives, ask yourself how you can best teach and defend the doctrine of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, while at the same time showing love, kindness, and understanding to a person who may not accept that doctrine. As you do, I testify that you will have our Heavenly Father's help and guidance. You will feel Him leading you along, putting thoughts in your minds and feelings in your hearts, and words in your mouths at the precise moment they are needed. I testify that as you do so, His Spirit will lead and guide you, transforming you into a true "example of the believers"<sup><a href="/devotionals/elder-von-g-keetch#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a></sup>-not only someone who lives the gospel of Jesus Christ, but also someone who defends and explains its doctrine in a firm yet loving and inclusive way.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p>I am grateful for this opportunity to speak with you today, and I will be even more grateful in about 30 minutes.<br /><br /> I would like to address my comments today to those who might be struggling with the realities of mortality, the tests that each of us may be going through or will go through in our walk through mortality.<br /><br /> First, I want to assure you that our personal trials and tests are all part of Heavenly Father's plan of happiness. This beautiful earth was created as a testing ground for those of us who kept their first estate. And because it is our Father's plan&mdash;who is perfect&mdash;then by some deductive reasoning this is a perfect test, designed specifically for you and for me. <br /><br /> The concept of a perfect test is demonstrated in the very popular children's book written by Roald Dahl titled <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>.&nbsp; Most of you are familiar with the book or the two movies based on the book. My second-grade teacher read it to us in class prior to our field trip to the Y&amp;S candy factory that made Twizzler red licorice in New Mexico. Notice how this story is similar to our journey through this mortal existence.<br /><br /> The story begins with an eccentric chocolatier, Willy Wonka, who has decided to open the doors of his chocolate factory for the first time in many years. He has hidden five golden tickets in chocolate bars shipped all over the world. Whoever buys the chocolate bar with the golden tickets is allowed to bring one guest and take the grand tour of his amazing chocolate factory. For the child in each of us, I'm not sure anything could be quite as great as touring a chocolate factory. Unknown to the five children and their guest, the tour is just half the story. The real reason Mr. Wonka comes up with this plan is that he is getting old and wants to find someone to take over the factory&mdash;someone he can trust with all his secret chocolate recipes. So, during the tour, Mr. Wonka devises a test&mdash;a special test&mdash;for each of the children who found a golden ticket. The child who passes his or her test would become the heir to the entire Wonka enterprise. <br /><br /> The five lucky children who find the golden tickets are the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled and petulant Verruca Salt, the gum chewing addict Violet Beauregard, the TV-obsessed Mike Teavee, and the poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The group meets in front of the magnificent gate of the chocolate factory at the predetermined day and begins their magical tour of the chocolate factory. One by one, each child is presented their test, each test perfectly crafted and disguised as part of the tour. <br /><br /> Augustus Gloop is the first child tested. He just cannot resist the idea of swimming and drinking from the river of pure chocolate. While attempting to lean over and take a drink, ignoring the warnings of Mr. Wonka to not touch the chocolate as to contaminate the entire river, he falls in and is eventually sucked up through a tube and off to another part of the factory. Augustus fails his test.<br /><br /> Next, Verruca Salt just has to have a cute little trained squirrel. Like everything else in her life, she demands that her daddy buy one. When Mr. Wonka tells the Salts that the squirrels are not for sale, she throws a fit and climbs over the railing she was told not to cross and ends up in the garbage chute, thus failing her test.<br /><br /> Violet Beauregard is presented with a test that she just can't refuse. She is the world champion bubblegum chewer; she has been chewing the same piece of gum for almost a year! &nbsp;A prototype gumball is being researched at the factory that will allow the chewer to actually eat their supper. Although it has not been tested on humans&mdash;and against the warnings of Mr. Wonka&mdash;Violet just has to try it. As she puts the gumball in her mouth, she enjoys the most delightful turkey dinner with all the trimmings&mdash;until she gets to desert, and instead of eating a blueberry pie, she becomes a blueberry. Violet fails her test.<br /><br /> Mike Teavee, who is obsessed with TV, fails his test because he just can't resist being part of the process of beaming from one place to another over the TV waves. He jumps in front of the machine to be transmitted-and poof, he is gone, lost in the airwaves over the chocolate factory, thus failing his test.<br /><br /> Then, lastly, there is the poverty-stricken little boy, Charlie Bucket. Part of his test is actually presented to him prior to entering the tour of the factory. When he finds the last golden ticket, as he runs home to tell his family, he is approached by a man from a competing candy company, offering Charlie a large sum of money if he will steal a piece of candy&mdash;a Gobstopper-during his tour and give it to him after the tour is over. So, during the tour, when the group enters the room where the Gobstoppers are being made, Charlie puts one in his pocket. At the end of the tour, Charlie and his grandpa are the only ones left. All the other kids have disappeared as the result of failing their test. Charlie has a change of heart and gives the Gobstopper back to Mr. Wonka. Charlie has passed the test. The man who offered to buy the Gobstopper from Charlie actually works for Mr. Wonka.<br /><br /> Just as Willie Wonka wanted to bestow his chocolate kingdom unto those who passed the test, our loving Heavenly Father has promised everything that the Father has could be ours if we are valiant in our tests here in mortality.<br /><br /> I would now like to share the story of two individuals who went through&mdash;and are going through&mdash;the tests in their lives and, through their faith, were and are able to overcome them. Hopefully, reviewing their stories, we will have the increased faith to be able to overcome our own trials and tests in life.<br /><br /> I remember my seminary teacher telling the story of Joseph sold into slavery in Egypt my freshman year of high school. I'm not sure why this particular story has stayed so strong with me; I didn't come from a large family. <br /><br /> If you recall the story from Genesis, Joseph was the eleventh son of Jacob. One night, Joseph has a dream, and in that dream he and all his brothers are in the field binding sheaves of cornstalk into bundles. Joseph's sheave stands upright, and all his brothers' sheaves are surrounding his, and they all make obeisance, or bow, to Joseph's sheaf. Now, I know that there are some students in the audience today that understand family dynamics, some probably better than I. But I do understand this simple rule: if you have a dream and you are basically the baby of the family, you don't go around telling your older brothers that they are going to one day bow down before you and worship you.<br /><br /> Joseph does share the vision with his older siblings, and you can imagine how it is received. They are not very happy. Then, to add some more problems to the family dynamics, Jacob has a special coat of many colors made specifically for Joseph. The perception of his older brothers is that their father loves him more and that Joseph is so arrogant that he thinks he is going to be their ruler.<br /><br /> So the story of the many trials and tests of Joseph begins fairly unassumingly, with Jacob asking Joseph to go and check on his older brothers out tending their flocks in the fields. Joseph searches for his brothers and eventually finds them in the valley of Dothan. As Joseph approaches his brothers, they can see him from afar because of his coat of many colors. They begin at that moment to devise a plan to kill their younger brother. <br /><br /> Ruben hears of their plan to slay Joseph, and he intervenes and says, "You can throw him into that pit, but you will not slay him."&nbsp; So when Joseph arrives to greet his brothers, they bind him, remove his coat of many colors, and throw him into a pit used to catch wild beasts. <br /><br /> While the brothers are eating their dinner that night, Judah comes up with a different plan. He had seen a band of Ishmaelites carrying all kinds of spices on their way to Egypt to sell their wares. He proposes that they sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites and that they in turn sell Joseph into slavery in Egypt. That way they get money for their brother and do not have the blood of their brother on their hands. So they agree and sell Joseph into slavery for 20 pieces of silver. To convince their father that Joseph was dead, they kill a kid from their herd of goats and sprinkle its blood on the coat of many colors. They then go home and show their father the coat and say they found this on their way home; has he seen Joseph?&nbsp; Jacob sees the coat splattered with blood and mourns for his son's apparent death for many days.<br /><br /> In our family, we kind of have this saying that we say jokingly&mdash;"That would be considered a bad day"&mdash;when something happens that we didn't expect or we see an event happen in the world. I would count being thrown into a pit with no food or water by your older brothers and then sold into slavery in a distant country as having a bad day.&nbsp; For a lot of us, including myself, I would be tempted to say in my prayer as I see my homeland fading into the distance, "Lord, how does this happen to me?&nbsp; I saw in a dream they were supposed to bow down to me; now I'm being sold into slavery."<br /><br /> This is where we begin to see a glimmer of the true character and faith of Joseph. He has no control over what just happened, save it be not sharing his dream with his brothers. Yet Joseph doesn't pout or blame God for his troubles. He has faith and exercises that faith. Joseph arrives in Egypt and is bought by Potiphar, who happens to be an officer of the Pharaoh and captain of the guard. &nbsp;In Genesis 39:2-4 we read, "And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand. And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand."<br /><br /> So Joseph decides if he is going to be a slave, he is going to be the best slave he can be. Not only does Joseph become the best slave, but the Lord blesses Joseph and Potiphar because of Joseph. Genesis 39:5: "The Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field."<br /><br /> Joseph soon becomes in charge of all the doings in Potiphar's estate. Joseph also gets the attention of Potiphar's wife. She makes several advances toward Joseph, and he refuses each of them. Finally, one day when Potiphar is away and no other of the Egyptian men are around, Potiphar's wife makes another advance toward Joseph. This time Joseph flees and runs away, but in so doing, Potiphar's wife rips the shirt off Joseph. She makes up this elaborate story when Potiphar returns that Joseph had made some advances toward her and that she had screamed for her life, and Joseph had run away, but she had been able to grab a piece of his clothing as he ran away. When she tells this story to Potiphar, whom do you think he is going to believe?&nbsp; His wife or a Hebrew slave from Canaan?&nbsp; Potiphar has Joseph thrown into the king's prison. &nbsp;Joseph is having a bad day!<br /><br /> Again we see a glimpse into Joseph's character. Joseph does not lose faith in the Lord. He doesn't curse his God because he was falsely accused and thrown into prison. &nbsp;We read in Genesis 39:21-22, "But the Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it."<br /><br /> While Joseph is over all the prisoners in the prison, two members of the Pharaoh's staff&mdash;the butler and the baker&mdash;had upset the king and had been thrown into prison. We don't know how long these two had been in prison; the scriptures say a "season." We can infer that it must have been long enough for Joseph to get to know them personally and to sense that one day something wasn't right. Joseph asks them what is bothering them.<br /><br /> They respond they have dreamed a dream, but there is no one to interpret them. Joseph answers, "Do not interpretations belong to God?&nbsp; Tell them to me, and my God will interpret them for you."&nbsp; Not sure I would have been so forthcoming on interpreting a dream. The last time Joseph talked about a dream, he got thrown in a pit and sold into slavery. But, nonetheless, that doesn't stop Joseph.<br /><br /> The butler tells Joseph about his dream first. He sees a vine with three branches, and on the third branch there is a cluster of ripe grapes. And he takes Pharaoh's cup and presses the grapes into wine and gives the cup to Pharaoh, and he drinks it. After hearing the butler's dream, Joseph tells him that the three branches are three days, and in three days the butler will be released from prison and will be restored back to his previous position as the Pharaoh's butler. Joseph then asks the butler to remember him when he is released and maybe find a positon outside of prison with the Pharaoh.<br /><br /> The baker hears the interpretation of the butler's dream, and since it is good, he tells Joseph that he too had a dream. The baker then tells Joseph of his dream. He dreams that he has three white baskets on his head. Each basket has all manner of baked treats for the Pharaoh, and the birds come down and eat all the bread out of the baskets on his head. Joseph tells the baker the interpretation of his dream is the three baskets are three days, and in three days the Pharaoh will cut off his head. The birds are going to eat his flesh. Notice that Joseph doesn't bother to tell the baker to remember him.<br /><br /> Sure enough, in three days exactly, what Joseph had interpreted in both the butler's and the baker's dream come to fruition, right down to the birds eating the flesh of the headless baker. But to Joseph's chagrin, the butler forgets about Joseph. Again, another bad day for Joseph.&nbsp; <br /><br /> Now fast forward <em>two</em> full years. Joseph is still in prison&mdash;in charge of all the goings on, but still a prisoner. The Pharaoh announces that he has had a dream. In his dream, he sees seven fatted cows and seven skinny cows, and in a separate dream he sees seven full ears of corn and seven thin ears of corn. The Pharaoh calls for all the magicians and wise men in the land, but no one can interpret the dream. Then the butler tells the Pharaoh what had transpired two years ago when he had been thrown in prison and how a young Hebrew boy who was a servant to the captain of the prison guard had interpreted his dream and the baker's dream, and how they both had come true.<br /><br /> You can imagine the shock Joseph receives when the Pharaoh's guards come to get Joseph out of prison. The scriptures say he had to shave, change his clothes, and hastily appear before the Pharaoh.<br /><br /> The Pharaoh greets Joseph and tells him that he has heard that he can interpret dreams. In Genesis 41:16 Joseph responds, "It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace."<br /><br /> I'm sure all of you are familiar with the interpretation of the dream. Joseph tells the Pharaoh that both dreams are really just one but doubled for effectiveness&mdash;there will be seven years of feast and seven years of famine-and that the dream is a warning to the Pharaoh of what God is about to do.<br /><br /> Pharaoh puts Joseph in charge over the storage of all the grain during the feast years and of dispersing the grain in the famine years. He gives Joseph his ring and dresses him in very costly apparel and even gives Joseph his second chariot!<br /><br /> Joseph's father and brothers are in Canaan, and they don't get the warning of the feast and famine years. The famine hits all the land, not just Egypt. News travels that Egypt has grain to sell. Jacob sends all 10 boys but does not let Benjamin go to Egypt to buy grain for their families. All 10 brothers come before Joseph and bow down with their faces to the earth, thus fulfilling the dream Joseph had told them some 15 or more years ago. You can imagine the struggle that is before Joseph. Here are all 10 brothers that sold him into slavery and caused him so much pain and anguish in his life, now desiring to buy grain to sustain their families and their herds. Think what you would do.&nbsp; I am guessing that if this had been my life's story and not Joseph's, the ending might have been a little different. Joseph hides his identity from his brothers and has them go back and get their younger brother. When they return and all 12 are together again, Joseph reveals himself, and you can imagine the family reunion they had that day. <br /><br /> Now, I would like to fast forward a few thousand years and introduce you to a former student of mine who has gone through, and continues to go through, some great trials and tests in his life. I have asked for his permission to share his story. I do not share his story for you to feel sorry for him or to have pity toward him. He doesn't need your pity. I share his story to somehow give you hope and strength, as we all go through our own trials here in mortality. Let me introduce you to Ammon Butcher. As you can see, Ammon was a typical boy doing typical boy things in his home state of Texas. Ammon is part of a large family: he has four brothers and three sisters.<br /><br /> Ammon loved sports, and in Texas everyone played football. He played football, but his true passion was wrestling. His passion paid off, and he became a very good wrestler. He wrestled in junior high and high school. Then one Saturday in January 2007, everything changed.<br /><br /> Ammon was participating in a high school wrestling tournament as a junior. He was engaged in a very tough match. His opponent was very aggressive and very strong. No one really knows exactly what happened, as there was no video of the match. What Ammon does recall is his opponent had him around his waist and was on top of Ammon. As Ammon stood up and tried to break free from his grasp, he was only able to break free of one hand, so his opponent quickly grabbed Ammon around one of his legs and spun to throw him back to the mat. In what is a completely legal move&mdash;and performed frequently in most wrestling matches&mdash;Ammon fell awkwardly on his neck. At that moment, Ammon's life changed forever. He lay fully conscious but motionless on the mat. He could not move or feel anything from the chest down. The medical diagnosis was a C4-C5 dislocation and compression. He did not technically break his neck; it was dislocated, and the dislocation put tremendous pressure on his spinal cord and caused irreparable damage.&nbsp;Ammon spent 26 days in intensive care. He weighed in that Saturday morning of the wrestling tournament 139.6 pounds. When he left the ICU, he weighed 110 pounds. <br /><br /> Fortunately for Ammon, he had his family, some great mentors from his high school, his wrestling coach, and an undeniable faith in our Savior. Though his experiences after the accident were never feelings of self-pity, just normal-day life had become enormously difficult. Ammon's mother would frequently tell her son, "Get up; you have to get back out there. Focus on what you can do. Someday you will have to provide for yourself and a family."<br /><br /> After the accident, there was a tremendous outpouring of support. Ammon remembers so many giving of their time, their means, and their talents. Emails flooded his inbox, monetary donations were made, letters poured in from across the globe, and good people were constantly by his bedside. The hospital actually had to move Ammon to a larger room to accommodate all the visitors.<br /><br /> After almost a full year of rehabilitation, Ammon needed to set new goals based on his new reality of life. Ammon was a fair student in high school but never really applied himself. Luckily for him, he did well enough in high school to not have failed any classes.<br /><br /> He began looking at his options of a potential career path. Ammon recalls thinking that he never really focused on academics, so he really didn't know what he could do. Obviously, any type of trade was out of the question without the use of his hands and legs. When he returned to high school, he faced the very strong possibility of failing a class for the very first time. He was struggling with coping with his new reality. However, once he got a grip on his new life, he began to realize he had some ability in the academic arena that he never really knew he had before the accident.<br /><br /> Once his high school grades began to improve and he took the college entrance exams, college was a strong possibility. He began to realize that it would have to be his mind to propel him to the heights he wanted to go.<br /><br /> Ammon enrolled at BYU-Idaho and decided to pursue a degree in accounting. I realize I'm completely biased here, but I have to admit it was the best decision he had made thus far. I met Ammon for the first time when he was a sophomore taking an Accounting 202 class I was teaching. Since that first meeting in 2011, I have been blessed to know him. <br /><br />Due to his limitations of being in a motorized wheelchair, Rexburg and BYU-Idaho did present some challenges. For Ammon, attending winter semester was out of the question. I did kid him on multiple occasions that I'm sure the engineering department could retrofit his wheelchair with tracks, and we could put some skis on the front, and he could have a motorized snow machine. But this was totally impractical. <br /><br /> It would be my wish for everyone within the sound of my voice to have the chance to meet Ammon in person. I know it would change your life. I am a different person because of my interactions with Ammon.<br /><br /> Ammon did very well with his studies here and graduated with a bachelor's degree in accounting in the fall of 2013. He was honored as one of our top accounting students and was invited to give the student address at the College of Business and Communication convocation that semester.<br /><br /> Graduate school is pushed pretty strongly in our profession. If you don't go on and get a master's degree, most states require 150 credit hours beyond high school in order to sit for the CPA exam. Ammon wanted to get his master's. He applied to all the large schools in Texas. He was actually accepted to University of Texas at Austin and SMU. UT-Austin is in the top five nationally for accounting programs. Brother Packard, an accounting faculty member here on campus, suggested Ammon apply to the Ohio State University's Fisher School of Business. He applied, and actually a week before he was going to send his acceptance letter to UT-Austin, he received a call from the recruiting and admissions coordinator at Ohio State University inviting him to come out to Columbus and take a tour of the school.<br /><br /> When Ammon first met Dr. Arya, the department chair for the Master of Accounting program, he had no idea of Ammon's disability. They offered Ammon a full-tuition scholarship with room and board and a monthly stipend. The value of this scholarship is roughly $65,000. <br /><br /> Ammon still maintained a love for wrestling and spoke of his love for it with Dr. Araya. He then got Ammon in touch with the OSU wrestling coach, Tom Ryan. When Coach Ryan offered Ammon a manager positon with the OSU wrestling team for the year he would be on campus, Ammon was sold. Ammon attended OSU and received his Master of Accounting degree in April 2015.<br /><br /> He also worked with Coach Ryan on building a leadership training program for the wrestling team. Ammon said, "Success in wrestling requires a person to make a multitude of little decisions correctly and the same in life. Through my injury, recovery, and transition to a new life, I have thought long and hard about the purpose of adversity, and I've asked, what is it about the second person that passes a barrier that the first could not and the next barrier that a third could pass but the second could not? I am working with Coach Ryan to develop a structured program to address areas where student athletes are guided in the process of making right decisions under extreme stress that over time will accumulate to success in all areas of their life, not just performance on the mat."&nbsp; As you can see, Ammon had a very positive impact on the wrestling program at OSU.<br /><br /> I recall Ammon visiting me in my office one day, and like a typical accountant he said, "Brother Foutz, do you have any idea how much it costs for me to function each month?"&nbsp; I told him I actually had no idea. He said, "It takes over 12 people each month for me to function. I need someone to help me get out of bed, shower, and get dressed. I need someone to cook and help me eat. I need someone to help with some of my daily tasks at school. And then I need someone at night to help me get ready for bed and then help to get into bed. I have figured it out, and I am going to have to make a lot of money in order for me to be self-sufficient and not a burden to society.<br /><br /> Little did Ammon know that the Lord was working his magic and guiding Ammon and his decisions. Unknown to Ammon at the time he decided to go to Ohio State, there was actually an apartment complex built specifically for individuals with disabilities like Ammon's. Each apartment is built and designed in such a way that lifts for his bed to lift him in and out are built into the celling. The lift can carry him right from his bed to the bathroom. There is 24-hour support available at the touch of a button, or it can be voice activated. There is transportation to and from his apartment to anywhere in Columbus.<br /><br /> This apartment has given Ammon the ability to work as a staff accountant with a large health care organization that has its headquarters in Columbus. He has begun his path to being self-sufficient.<br /><br /> To quote Ammon, "I have drunk from the bitter cup, but I refuse to be bitter. Just like muscles in the body, the spirit needs stress to grow, and that is what I take from my accident&mdash;through it I have grown my spirit. I am also fortunate to learn I could get excited about what I could do with my mind. I don't spend any time thinking about my injury or what could have been. I let the research take care of itself. If there is a therapy that can help me, great. But until that time, I am not thinking about it. There is too much to accomplish, and I'm not going to get caught up in worrying about something that only might happen; there are things I can make happen and lives I can touch. That is what drives me."<br /><br /> I am looking forward to following from a distance what Ammon will do next. He continues to amaze me and motivates me to be a better teacher, father, husband, and child of our Heavenly Father.<br /><br /> For Joseph or Ammon, it would have been be easy to say, "Look this is bad. I've had some tough things happen to me, and I'm done; I'm over it," and blame God or someone else for what happened. Instead, they both turned to their Lord and Savior and said, "I can handle this test before me, and with my faith and belief in our Heavenly father I can survive."<br /><br /> I know there are many within the sound of my voice that are experiencing very difficult things, or you will encounter very difficult tests. Some might not seem as significant as Ammon's or Joseph's, but they are significant to you. That is part of the plan of happiness. We signed up for them. They are tests perfectly designed for each of us. It's important that we realize that. You can't look at your roommate or spouse or brother or sister and say, "Why are they struggling with that?&nbsp; I wouldn't have any problem handling that trial or test." Well, guess what? It's not your trial; it's theirs&mdash;perfectly designed for them. It is your job to give aid when needed and help when asked for. <br /><br /> It's important to realize that we do not have to go through these tests alone. Through the enabling power of the Atonement, the Savior is there for each of us. He knows how it feels because He has felt it. He suffered for you and for me. This I know because I have felt his help and been strengthened by His presence in my times of need. And I stand here as a witness that He will do the same for you. But you have to ask. <br /><br /> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Her favorite was serving in a Primary presidency for nine years. She currently teaches Relief Society. She dreams of the day when she will have free time to pursue the hobbies of baking, gardening, and reading fiction.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p>My oldest son, Jackson, left on a mission seven months and twenty-four days ago. The evening Jackson was set apart, our stake president was visiting with our family and asked us to go around the room and take turns offering advice for our missionary. When it was my turn, with a heavy heart, and through a lot of tears, I shared with my son the words of the nineteenth-century American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson wrote, "Sorrow looks back, worry looks around, but faith looks up." The next day, we dropped Jackson off at the MTC in Provo. When I saw the look on his face as he was walking away from our car, I thought the only place Jackson or any of our family could look, at that time, was up-with faith. But I was wrong, and so was the poet Emerson. I know our Heavenly Father wants us to look up to Him and our Savior Jesus Christ in faith, but I also believe Heavenly Father wants us to look back other than in times of sorrow and to look around more than in times of worry.<br /><br /> The prophet Lehi taught the importance of looking back when he followed the will of the Lord and sent his sons back to Jerusalem to retrieve the genealogy of his fathers. You are all familiar with the dramatic account of Nephi slaying Laban then donning Laban's armor and sword and going into the treasury to obtain the plates of brass. We have all sung the great Primary anthem and committed to being like Nephi: "I will go! I will do!" But how many of you have really thought about where Nephi was going, what he was doing, and why? How many of you have thought about how important those records really were? How many of you have reflected on Nephi's words: "And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children"?<br /><br /> You are the children that Nephi was talking about. Every time you read the scriptures, you are looking back. By looking back and studying the scriptures, you are solidifying your foundation and testimony of the gospel. I realize you are very busy with school, but I encourage you to make time to study the records of your fathers, to learn the genealogy of your fathers and mothers-your family history. The experiences of your loved ones can provide the encouragement you need to weather storms of temptations, trials, and sorrow.<br /><br /> I hate camping. I do not like dirt or campfires. In fact, much to the chagrin of my adventurous husband and sons, I have established a rule that I will only sleep in a tent one night every five years. You can only imagine my consternation when my husband and I were called to be a ma and pa for our stake's pioneer trek last summer. I have often read my family history. I have always been proud that my pioneer ancestors were a part of the Willie and Martin handcart companies. Yet I never appreciated-and still cannot fully comprehend-what they went through for me, and you, and every other Latter-day Saint. On the second day of the trek, I participated in the women's pull. It was near record-breaking heat. Several of the youth were suffering from heat stroke, blisters, and sun burns. The sagebrush was waist high, and the ruts in the trail were 12 inches deep. I shared a position at the back of our company's handcart with one other young woman, and there were two young women pulling in the front of the handcart. The men were not allowed to touch the handcarts or help the women in any way as we labored up the 20 percent grade. It was hard! What got me up that hill was looking back. I do not mean looking back at the sisters and handcarts behind me but looking back and thinking about my pioneer ancestors. <br /><br /> My ancestors pushed and pulled heavy handcarts for 117 days, from Iowa City to Salt Lake City, over 1,400 miles in blazing heat, wind, rain, and snow. They did not have Solomon trail shoes, UV-resistant and moisture-wicking clothing, or ice-cold electrolyte drinks at the top of the hill. They did not have Springbar tents, sub-zero sleeping bags, or ATVs to transport the sick and afflicted. In fact, I want to share with you a few entries from the pioneer history of my great, great, great, great grandmother, Sarah Denton Moulton:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The trials of the Willie Company were getting more difficult all the time. Provisions were running low. The rickety carts were needing repair. Fear that the entire company would perish prevented even proper ceremonies for the dead. The extra burdens put upon the handcarts because of the loss of the wagons and cattle was more than many of the immigrants could bear. Loads had to be greatly lessened by leaving behind more articles of clothing and bedding, which were sorely needed but which had to be disposed of so that progress could be made. To add to these difficulties, winter set in early that year.<br /><br /> Cold weather, scarcity of food, lassitude, and fatigue from over-exertion soon produced their effects. Our old and infirm people began to droop, and they no sooner lost spirit and courage than death's stamp could be traced upon their features . . . At first the deaths occurred slowly and irregularly, but in a few days at more frequent intervals, until we thought it unusual to leave a campground without burying one or more persons . . . Many a father pulled his cart, with his little children on it, until the day preceding his death. I have seen some pull their carts in the morning, give out during the day, and die before the next morning."</p>
<p>These pioneers fled persecution, left their earthly possessions behind, and lost loved ones on the trail for us. When was the last time you looked back at their hardships for inspiration to endure your trials? Whether it is one generation or five, whether it is from your own family history or someone else's, look back. Let their faith-promoting experiences provide the motivation you need to press forward. <br /><br /> A few years ago, my husband and I took our children on a cruise to Mexico. When we stopped in Cabo San Lucas, we decided to go zip lining. This was my first experience, and I guess I expected some lush, cool rain forest that had been cleared enough for us to "zip" from tree to tree. This is what we got. I have never been more scared, hot, or sweaty in my life! My son Wynter was ten years old at the time. Wynter was born prematurely and has been chronically underweight his whole life. Many of you may consider it a blessing to have doctors tell you to slather butter and cream cheese on everything you eat, but trust me, when it comes to zip lining, being underweight is a curse. No matter how fast Wynter started, the laws of physics and motion prevented him from ever making it from point to point. At a particularly wide and high chasm, I volunteered to go with Wynter. I thought for sure our combined weight would be enough to get us across. No such luck. Less than halfway across, we came to a complete stop. We were upside down and backwards. With my legs wrapped around Wynter's body, I began using my arms and the cable to pull us hand over hand across the ravine. It was so hot and exhausting that I quickly lost strength and could not go on. My son and I hung there, hundreds of feet off the ground, scared, and knowing that if something went wrong with the cable or the carabiner, we would plummet to certain death. Although it seemed like an eternity, in reality within a couple of minutes, our guide hooked himself to the cable and came to rescue us. He wrapped his legs around Wynter and me and quickly pulled us to safety.</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants 84:88, our Savior promises, "...I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up."&nbsp; While it may sometimes feel like we are upside down and backwards, frightened and struggling to make it through life, this scripture reassures us that we are not alone and prompts us to look around for help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland profoundly declared:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Because Jesus walked such a long, lonely path utterly alone, we do not have to do so. His solitary journey brought great company for our little version of the path--the merciful care of our Father in Heaven, the unfailing companionship of this Beloved Son, the consummate gift of the Holy Ghost, angels in heaven, family members on both sides of the veil, prophets and apostles, teachers, leaders, friends. All of these and more have been given as companions for our mortal journey because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the Restoration of His gospel. Trumpeted from the summit of Calvary is the truth that we will never be left alone or unaided..."</p>
<p>I testify of the truthfulness of Elder Holland's message-you are not alone; you are not unaided.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, take a second and look to your left and see who's there.&nbsp; Look to your right and notice who's by your side. Probably more importantly in this day and age, check out how many people are on your contact list in your cell phone. Heavenly Father knew that throughout our entire lives, we would need trusted friends and mentors. Look "round about you"-who is bearing you up personally, academically, and professionally? Who is bearing you up spiritually, emotionally, physically, and mentally? Equally as important: who are you bearing up? Are you an angel to someone? <br /><br /> I know how much you all love group projects. My students tell me all the time they want more group work-they love having their grades dependent on the work ethic of others. Don't you all feel that way? In all seriousness, I firmly believe the "teach one another" aspect of the learning model was divinely inspired to help us have and become mentors and to bear each other up. Principle five of the learning model states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"At BYU-Idaho, students teach to learn, and learn to teach. When students teach diligently, they receive deeper insight and are instructed more perfectly. When learners and teachers view one another charitably, they create safe learning environments where all can stretch and stumble without fear. All learners-students and faculty-serve others through diligent preparation, cooperative effort, and teaching one another; thus charity replaces competition."</p>
<p>The "teach one another" component of the learning model and the idea of having and being angels, friends, and mentors to each other is patterned after Christ's admonition: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."</p>
<p>I work full time, go to school full time, and have a lengthy work commute. Needless to say, I sit a lot. People are starting to notice because, recently, Brother Kimpel warned me that "sitting is the new smoking," and my husband has made it his personal mission to get me active and back into shape. A few weeks ago, we were in Sun Valley, and after a big dinner, my husband announced it was time for a hike. When I asked where we would be going, he simply pointed to a mountain and stated, "Just up there for a little ways." He has a habit of doing that. He knows that if he told me how far we would be hiking, I probably would not go. We made our way to the base of the trail and then headed straight up. He kept telling me that we were going to the top, but when there are mountains upon mountains, I did not know what that meant. My legs and lungs were burning and my heart was racing. My husband kept suggesting that I look back at how far we had come or look around at the beauty of nature, but the only thing I could do was look up and wonder if I could really make it.</p>
<p>We will all have experiences in our lives when no amount of looking back or looking around can provide the relief we need and the peace we desire. That is why the Savior promised, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you." Jesus Christ knew that we would all have experiences where looking up to Him, in faith, would be our only source of comfort. He is there. He is our advocate with the Father. He is pleading for us and with us when He cries, "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."<br /><br /> In the most recent general conference, Elder Donald L. Hallstrom specifically asked us where we look in times of need. Elder Hallstrom remarked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In real life, we face actual, not imagined, hardships. There is pain--physical, emotional, and spiritual. There are heartbreaks when circumstances are very different from what we had anticipated. There is injustice when we do not seem to deserve our situation. There are disappointments when someone we trusted failed us. There are health and financial setbacks that can be disorienting. There may be times of question when a matter of doctrine or history is beyond our current understanding. When difficult things occur in our lives, what is our immediate response? Is it confusion or doubt or spiritual withdrawal? Is it a blow to our faith? Do we blame God or others for our circumstances? Or is our first response to remember who we are--that we are children of a loving God?"</p>
<p>Looking up takes strength. Having faith takes discipline, practice, and endurance. Increasing our spiritual capacity takes as much training as increasing our physical capacity. Regardless of how taxing the mental work may seem, sitting in front of a computer screen or behind a steering wheel will never prepare my body to physically get to the top of a mountain. Spiritual capabilities are no different. Faith must be exercised, and looking up takes training. <br /><br /> President Howard W. Hunter cautioned, "Developing spirituality and attuning ourselves to the highest influences of godliness is not an easy matter. It takes time and frequently involves a struggle. It will not happen by chance, but is accomplished only through deliberate effort and by calling upon God and keeping his commandments..." <br /><br /> It is easy to say you have faith when life is smooth. It is much different to actually possess the spiritual strength, which enables hope and trust in our Savior's grace, when you are facing a trial and questioning how you will ever endure it. <br /><br /> Some of you are struggling with school and finances. Many of you are facing major life decisions such as marriage, starting a family, graduate school, and employment. Perhaps you or a loved one is suffering from an addiction. Some of you are battling depression, anxiety, or fear. Perhaps you or a loved one has been diagnosed with a serious illness. Maybe you lost a loved one to an illness or another tragedy. On an academic level, you may believe that Christ will carry your burdens, yet you do not know how to physically and spiritually hand them over. You may feel as though you are pulling your heavy handcart full of trials alone. I encourage you to look back! Speaking about our pioneer ancestors, Brother Brad Wilcox said, "Faithful pioneers knew they were not alone. The task ahead of them was never as great as the power behind them."<br /><br /> Some of you may feel as though you are at a standstill on life's zip line-that you are hanging upside and backwards without the strength to pull yourself to safety. I say to you, "Look around! Help is here; angels surround you and are pulling for you." Brother Wilcox counseled, "Parents are pulling for you, leaders are pulling for you...prophets are pulling for you. And Jesus is pulling <em>with</em> you." <br /><br /> I know many of you are thinking and feeling that you are training your spirituality-you are living the gospel, obeying the commandments, and keeping your covenants, yet it is not enough to endure life's uphill hike. I plead with you to look up! "Christ doesn't just make up the difference; He is the difference." Brother Wilcox exhorted: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Christ is not waiting at the finish line once we have done 'all we can do.' He is with us every step of the way...[Christ's] grace is not a booster engine that kicks in once our fuel supply is exhausted. Rather, it is our constant energy source. It is not the light at the end of the tunnel but the light that moves us through the tunnel...[Jesus] paid our debt in full. He didn't pay it all except for a few coins. He paid it all. It is finished."</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, your Heavenly Father lives. He knows you better than you know yourselves. He knows how amazing and strong you are because He created you-in His image. He loves you personally, unconditionally, and perfectly. He sent His son to be the ultimate example for you. Jesus Christ lived the perfect life and, out of love, sacrificed it to become your Savior and Redeemer. He intricately felt your joys and your pains-all of them. Look up. Love Him. Learn of Him. Trust in Him. Lean on Him. I so testify in His name, Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Facilities Management Operations Director</p>
<p>Kyle Williams was raised in southeast Idaho.&nbsp; He received an associate degree from Ricks College, and a bachelor's and master's degree from the University of Idaho in Industrial Technology.</p>
<p>Brother Williams spent several years attending trade school and pursuing a career in the building trades before coming to work at Ricks College seventeen years ago.&nbsp; He has worked in various positions here on campus, and is currently the Facilities Director of Maintenance and Operations.</p>
<p>Brother Williams has served as a missionary in the Costa Rica San Jose mission, as a scoutmaster, Sunday School president, elder's quorum president, and is currently the bishop of the Plano ward.</p>
<p>He and his wife, Katie, met at Ricks College while attending a Book of Mormon class taught by Brother Randy Hayes. Next month they will celebrate their 23<sup>rd</sup> wedding anniversary.&nbsp; They are the parents of five children; their two oldest twin sons are BYU-Idaho students.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p>May I first say how much I love and appreciate you, the students, faculty, and staff at BYU-Idaho. You students are a chosen generation, and I can see that the Lord has a great purpose for you here at BYU-Idaho as well as when you leave this place and go on to larger things around the world.<br /><br /> What a great time of year to speak to you today! I want to thank our Father in Heaven for this glorious country that we live in and the freedoms that we enjoy. Celebration of our independence is a reminder of those who also sacrificed for that freedom. Freedom is what was needed to bring to pass the Restoration of the gospel and restoration of all that was necessary for all the saving ordinances to be restored. &nbsp;There is always a special feeling during this time of year; I hope that we don't ever take our freedoms for granted and always keep the humility necessary to keep the Lord's blessings over this sacred nation. <br /><br /> I consider myself a simple man. I don't consider myself very complicated or needy of great or elaborate things. I married a simple Idaho gal that came from a simple family, and my hope is that I am also raising a simple family. We try not to complicate our lives but instead try to keep things simple and unelaborate. I think that this is how Christ's disciples were also: simple men who knew the truth when they heard it and followed the promptings of the Savior and the Spirit. I hope that all here at BYU-Idaho are simple, humble people that can recognize truth when they see or hear it and can follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost and become disciples of the Savior. <br /><br /> In 2004 Elder David A. Bednar called BYU-Idaho a Disciple Preparation Center in the following words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Let me suggest that in Rexburg, Idaho, we are in the process of creating not a missionary training center (MTC) but a Disciple Preparation Center&mdash;a DPC. In this special and sacred and set-apart place, you and I have access to unparalleled spiritual resources that can assist us in developing and deepening our devotion as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the primary and most important reason for the existence of Brigham Young University-Idaho and for its sponsorship by and affiliation with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."</p>
<p>Twelve years ago, when Elder Bednar addressed us and made this declaration, I recall thinking to myself, "Is he calling me a disciple of Jesus Christ?"&nbsp; What does that really mean, to become a disciple of Jesus Christ? If a disciple of Jesus Christ stood before us and we could see and touch him or her, what would they look like? How would they sound? How would they act? And what would they say or do that could persuade me to know they are true disciples of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?<br /><br /> My hope for you today is to help you understand that you are disciples of Jesus Christ, and it is manifest in the things that you say and the actions that you perform on a daily basis. And I also hope that you can perfect those characteristics in your life and stay true to being a disciple of Jesus Christ throughout your earthly life. I have prayerfully considered a few ideas that will help us on our road of discipleship. <br /><br /> Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Part of discipleship should be to become high-yield, low-maintenance members of the Church. These members are not high profile; they won't be on the six o'clock evening news when they die. But they have done what Heavenly Father has wanted them to do meekly and humbly."</p>
<p>So we are at a Disciple Preparation Center, and part of being disciples should be, as Elder Maxwell states, to become high-yield, low-maintenance members of the Church that are humble. Elder Bednar and Elder Maxwell have a vision of what every bishop in the Church prays for: disciples of Christ that are high-output, low-maintenance members.<br /><br /> To help you understand my perspective, I want to begin by helping you understand how I can relate both my profession as facilities manager and my role as a bishop and father around this topic. <br /><br />One of the greatest inventions in this world is the common light bulb invented by Thomas Edison: a carbon filament enclosed in a vacuum that, when energized, glows red-hot and produces light and heat. The incandescent light bulb has been a household object for decades and has brightened, enlightened, and enriched our daily lives in innumerable ways. Its uses are far-reaching and extend around the world. It took years to perfect but has been extremely beneficial in its application and purpose. A 60-watt incandescent light bulb can last on average about 1,200 hours. An average household can pay about $328.00 per year for lighting using incandescent bulbs. By today's measures, this is considered a low-output, high-maintenance device with a very short life cycle, fragile filaments and structure, and a need for a hefty power source. We still have a very small numbers of these devices on campus that we are trying to replace and upgrade. <br /><br /> Technological advances in fluorescent lighting have brought a change of how we can be better stewards of both energy and cost by producing better-quality and more-efficient lighting that also requires very little maintenance. <br /><br /> Today's technology of light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, is leading the way. LEDs are found on most smartphones, flashlights, and light bulbs and are far more advanced in both efficiency and diversity. An LED replacement bulb for a 60-watt incandescent bulb will only consume six to eight watts of energy but will produce the same amount of light. They will last 50,000 hours and will light an average home for about $32.00 per year. These durable, rugged-constructed devices with lower power consumption are truly amazing. <br /><br /> From this modern technology we get a high-output and low-maintenance device: a long-lasting, high-lumen light that can run on a low consistent amount of input energy and produce light over an extended amount of time.<br /><br /> Today's disciples should be similar to LED light bulbs in the sense that the Lord needs high-output, low-maintenance members of the Church that can run on a low consistent amount of input over an extended amount time.<br /><br /> How can we be high-output, low-maintenance members of the Church, and better yet, how can we be "light-emitting disciples," or LEDs?<br /><br /> In the follow up to his "Raise the Bar" conference talk, Elder M. Russell Ballard requested some of these things when he asked for missionaries with the following qualities:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"What we need . . . is the greatest generation of missionaries in the history of the Church. We need worthy, qualified, spiritually energized missionaries.&nbsp;. . . "We need your whole heart and soul. We need vibrant, thinking, passionate missionaries who know how to listen to and respond to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit."</p>
<p>I would echo his request with my own request by simply substituting "members" in place of "missionaries" in that statement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"What we need . . . is the greatest generation of [members] in the history of the Church. We need worthy, qualified, spiritually energized [members]. . . . &nbsp;"We need your whole heart and soul. We need vibrant, thinking, passionate [members] who know how to listen to and respond to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit."</p>
<p>We need the greatest generation of light-emitting disciples. We need them prepared to leave this Disciple Preparation Center on a path of discipleship, prepared to report to a family ward where a bishop can see their desire, willingness, and worthiness. We need them prepared to receive callings and serve diligently in the kingdom of God on the earth. Let me describe what this may look like. Imagine that you are a bishop somewhere around the globe and that a new membership record has arrived in your ward, and you see that it is a single or newly married couple that is moving from BYU-Idaho into your ward. I can tell you that your heart jumps in your chest and you become giddy with excitement. Why are you so excited?&nbsp; It is because you are receiving the Lord's blessed disciples, and if these new ward members have followed the council of their university president, previous bishop, mother and father, and maybe even their past mission president, you know that you are receiving a true gift from our Father in Heaven to assist in building the Lord's kingdom within your ward. <br /><br /> I have seen and felt this excitement and can testify that it is true. Today I would like to share with you some characteristics of light-emitting discipleship that I feel are most valuable in becoming a high-output, low-maintenance disciple.<br /><br /> 1. Always be worthy.<br /><br /> A light fixture is only as useful as its power source, be it battery, solar, wind generation, or a strong, reliable power provider. Top-quality LED lights operate best when firmly attached to a strong, reliable power source. You can make an electrical connection just by simply touching conductors and keeping them touching, and the electrons will flow and create light. The best light comes when the connections are firm, with adequate wire connectors and mechanical connections, much like light-emitting disciples need to be firmly connected to a strong, reliable power source. I am talking about being firmly connected. The best connection is living worthily. Moroni explained this characteristic in Mormon 9:29:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"See that ye are not baptized unworthily; see that ye partake not of the sacrament of Christ unworthily; but see that ye do all things in worthiness, and do it in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; and if ye do this, and endure to the end, ye will in nowise be cast out."</p>
<p>Our living prophet said it best in the most recent priesthood session of general conference:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We read in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.36?lang=eng#35">Doctrine and Covenants, section 121, verse 36,</a>&nbsp;'The rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven.' What a wonderful gift we have been given. Ours is the responsibility to guard and protect that priesthood and to be worthy of all the glorious blessings our Father in Heaven has in store for us&mdash;and for others through us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherever you go, your priesthood goes with you. Are you standing in holy places? Before you put yourself and your priesthood in jeopardy by venturing into places or participating in activities which are not worthy of you or of that priesthood, pause to consider the consequences. Remember who you are and what God expects you to become. You are a child of promise. You are a man of might. You are a son of God.<br /><br /> "This precious gift of priesthood power brings with it not only solemn responsibilities but also special blessings for ourselves and for others. May we, in whatever place we may find ourselves, always be worthy to call upon its power, for we never know when our need and our opportunity to do so may come."</p>
<p><br /> The definition of worthiness is to be personally righteous and to stand approved in the sight of God and His appointed leaders. Being worthy and humble is key to being a high-output, low-maintenance, light-emitting disciple of Jesus Christ. Remain plugged in and firmly connected through living a worthy lifestyle, reading your scriptures, praying daily, attending your church meetings, following the direction of the prophet, and living a chaste and virtuous life. Remain firmly connected to that source of power and light which is our Savior, Jesus Christ. <br /><br /> 2. Never turn down an opportunity to serve. <br /><br /> As disciples, you will be called upon to serve in wards in multiple callings as teachers and leaders. Do not shirk away from this great opportunity. Follow the direction given in Doctrine and Covenants 107:99: "Wherefore, now let every man learn his&nbsp;duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all&nbsp;diligence." <br /><br /> You will receive callings that you have never served in, and you will need to learn your duties and responsibilities in that calling and perform those duties as directed. What a great opportunity to learn and grow. I recall being called to teach Gospel Doctrine class shortly after moving into my current ward. I was only 24 years old and was teaching ward members older and more mature than I was&mdash;not to mention a couple of ward members that were college professors that really kept me on my toes. I did my best to prepare and learn the message. I discovered that if I would just direct the class and keep them on subject, the Spirit would lead me to ask the right question, and together we would learn what the Spirit wanted to teach us. <br /><br /> Remember that you will have opportunities to serve within the walls of your own home and bless your spouse and children. Build a home where the Spirit can be invited in and live comfortably. You will soon find that you are partners with the Lord in raising up His spirits, and you will see that your everyday, small decision to strengthen your family through prayer and scripture study will build low-maintenance, high-output disciples in your home.<br /><br /> 3. Learn how to work.<br /><br /> In the book of Genesis when Adam received a helpmeet and was tempted, the Lord gave him a command.<a name="15"></a> We read in Genesis 2:15,&nbsp;"And the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;God took the man, and put him into the garden&nbsp;of&nbsp;Eden&nbsp;to dress it&nbsp;and to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;it."<br /><br /> And after the Fall of Adam, he was cast out of the garden and was instructed that by the sweat of his brow he would eat all the days of his life.<br /><br /> In these passages we are instructed that we must work. Whether we are tilling the soil or providing valuable services to others for compensation, we are to work for our physical well-being. In the Church today we call it being self-reliant. Church Handbook 2 states the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Self-reliance is the ability, commitment, and effort to provide the spiritual and temporal necessities of life for self and family. As members become self-reliant, they are also better able to serve and care for others. "Church members are responsible for their own spiritual and temporal well-being. Blessed with the gift of agency, they have the privilege and duty to set their own course, solve their own problems, and strive to become self-reliant. Members do this under the inspiration of the Lord and with the labor of their own hands."</p>
<p><br /> Nephi shared how he taught this principle in 2 Nephi 5:17: "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be&nbsp;industrious, and to&nbsp;labor&nbsp;with their&nbsp;hands."<br /><br /> Gain a skill that is useful and valuable in the work force; learn to do hard, difficult, and thought-provoking work. Notice that I did not say learn to do tedious menial labor, although that may be how you get started. I remember working fast food, cleaning toilets, washing windows, moving sprinkler pipe, digging ditches&mdash;all of which had a skill or a piece of knowledge to help me be a better and more productive person. To this day I can make the best fried chicken in our family, and they love it. &nbsp;<br /><br /> I would like to share with you the example that I followed in learning how to work. In 1965, my father lived on a small farm west of Blackfoot and was busy raising a family and doing his very best at being a provident provider. He had six children at the time and already had many ups and downs in his career of farming and ranching. His wife was complaining of headaches and was soon diagnosed with a brain tumor. Radiation treatment was new for tumors and not very successful. She soon succumbed to the tumor and passed away. As you can imagine, my father was heartbroken, being a single father of six with a farm, a cattle operation, and a dairy, and no helpmeet. Through prayer and being humble before the Lord, he was directed to attend a singles dance, where he met my mother. After a very short courtship of just a few months, they were married in the Idaho Falls Temple. After a brief honeymoon, my mother jumped heart first from being single to being a wife of a farmer and mother of six children. Within just a few months, she invited three more of her own nephews to live with them. Caring for the children, the farm, and ranch hands as well as a few nephews was overwhelming at times. My sisters shared with me about a time when they got dropped off at school late, and they told the principal that they were late because Mom ran away and Dad had to go get her. She returned as instructed by a loving earthly father and soon found a happy medium in loving and caring for everyone and everything on the farm. I think it was because of the more frequent visits by her mother and father during the peak demands of farm life. <br /><br /> A loving marriage takes lots of love and lots of hard work. My father and mother never turned away from the gospel and never turned away from the hard work on the farm. Four more children were added to the mix, including me and my twin sister. My mother went to work outside of the home to help support my brother in the mission field and stayed employed after he returned to help keep the family farm prosperous. Farming had its good and bad years for my father, but his faith and teaching the gospel to his children made him very prosperous, and he was truly blessed by Heavenly Father. We were taught in the home that work was a blessing and to never turn away from doing something difficult. When my mother turned 62 years old, she approached me and asked for some council. My parents wanted to serve a mission but knew they did not have the financial means to provide for a mission and continue to pay a mortgage and all the expenses that come from owning a home. The family agreed that if they were willing to serve, we 10 children would help assist with the extra costs. <br /><br /> They were called to the Texas McAllen Mission and served faithfully until my mother was struck by a car and killed. On the day she died, she fed the office missionaries a good home-cooked Idaho meal of roast beef and potatoes and gravy and sent them back to the office in the care of my father. She prepared a salad and was walking to another senior couple's apartment to meet my dad when she was struck by a passing car. My mother never faltered in her testimony or her desire to serve the Lord and carry her burdens and work out her salvation here on the earth. She was a shining example of a faithful high-output, low-maintenance member of the Church. My father remarried and served three more missions with his new companion and still continues to be an example to me of a high-output, low-maintenance member of the Church. The same month I started working here at BYU-Idaho was the same month that my mother passed away. I am extremely grateful for the new coworkers and administrators that supported me during that time of my life; they are also examples of high-output, low-maintenance members that give so freely and lovingly. <br /><br /> Light bulbs, when properly and firmly connected to a strong power source, can emit light for a very long time. They can share that precious light that allows all who want to benefit. <br /><br /> There is one final characteristic that will help us to share our own light, and that is diligence.<br /><br /> 4. Be diligent.<br /><br /> Diligence is the constant and earnest effort to accomplish what you desire. It is a characteristic of a high-output, low-maintenance, light-emitting disciple of Jesus Christ. If we want to share our light, we must learn to be diligent in our service. <br /><br /> In Mosiah 4:27 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be&nbsp;<em>diligent</em>, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order" (italics added).</p>
<p>Diligence is not simply an act of enduring to the end but an act of enduring to the end in righteousness. It is living the principles of the gospel, making covenants, and keeping those covenants. It is loving others and using our time and talents in building the Lord's kingdom here on the earth. <br /><br /> In summary, the characteristics of light-emitting disciples are to be worthy, to never turn down an opportunity to serve, to learn how to work, and to be diligent. These disciple characteristics will help you be strongly connected to a reliable power source, emitting the light of the Savior. May we always be found worthy of the gospel blessings which we receive. May we serve and accept the call of the Lord and work with all our hearts to bring to pass His plan on the earth. May we be found to be high-output, low-maintenance, light-emitting disciples serving diligently in His kingdom. I testify that God lives, Jesus is the Christ, and that we are His disciples on this earth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Business Management Faculty Member</p>
<p>Bill Crawford joined the church as a teenage youth while living with his aunt in Oregon. He attended a semester at Ricks College before serving a Spanish-speaking mission to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He studied mechanical engineering and aerospace studies at BYU, where he met the love of his life, Cheryl Lott. Bill received a commission in the United States Air Force in December 1994.<br /><br /> During his time in the Air Force, Bill flew the F-16 fighter and B-2 bomber. He served as both a flight leader and mission commander, logging combat time in both aircraft, including a 35.5 hour non-stop combat mission from Missouri to Iraq and back during Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p>
<p>Bill attended the Harvard Business School, where he received a Master in Business Administration degree in 2006. He came to BYU-Idaho after working for several years in the medical device industry as a business manager.</p>
<p>Bill and Cheryl are the parents of six children. Their oldest child, Kaiti, is a freshman at BYU-Idaho. Bill's favorite church callings have been teaching Primary and youth Sunday School. He loves to teach and to cook.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p>On a Sunday morning in March 2003, I awoke and got ready and went to church with my family, just as I would on any other Sunday. We sat together in sacrament meeting, Sister Crawford expecting our fourth child. I remember looking at my little family and wondering what their lives would be like without me. I was comforted knowing that Cheryl is a strong, righteous, resilient mother.</p>
<p>After sacrament meeting, I went home and took a nap. I needed to be well rested for work that evening. Normally I loved my job, but I was not looking forward to work on this day. A few hours later, I was at the controls of a stealth bomber loaded with 32,000 pounds of guided weapons, headed to war.<br /><br /> &nbsp; <img alt="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nyuXRb4ZFkCEDHAoTPSilt0qMZhH5MPKurTDU0Qhiok67WVY4Qs7xUYdEfHxqEtf95T5x3DEF3xPprQl50QGlaSFLot27fsUljUPTykIaAHqbUQbzGxNXbeuUg8WwuH7WnbDXVtC" height="159" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring 2016/Devotional Graphics/Picture1.png" width="348" /> &nbsp;</p>
<p>We departed from our base in Missouri, the heartland of America. Our destination: Baghdad, Iraq. We had been briefed on the dangers of flying into Iraqi defenses. They were equipped with anti-aircraft radar, missiles, and artillery. Baghdad is a long flight from Missouri. I had a lot of time to think about things on the way there.</p>
<p>I thought about my family. I carried this photo of us in my breast pocket as a reminder of why I served in the military. In case I got shot down, my plan was to show the Iraqis this photo so they would know I was a normal person, just like them.&nbsp; What was I thinking? I'm not sure this particular photo was a good choice to show that we are "normal," but I love it.<br /><br /> <img alt="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4oIAfSUjag9xo3lNFqig5j_3muoTILsOTBM7VjnEH4NAASZv13CbUOuYHV65Km0zagNzjk5frH_YiVP8XK6iyzPDDAkjPSfo9NBJdv51QkIdSgaStpdAHVzvNhyHWBDtz-ONhxdx" height="224" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring 2016/Devotional Graphics/Picture2.png" width="143" /> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought about my patriarchal blessing, which contained these words:</p>
<p>"In this life it sometimes becomes necessary to serve in the armed forces. Should this calling come to you, accept it and serve with gladness and strength... The Lord will protect you from danger and harm if you are willing to accept His inspiration and guidance in your life, so keep the commandments."</p>
<p>I hoped that I had lived worthy to claim that promise.</p>
<p>Baghdad's air defenses weren't the only challenges we had to face during our mission. In order to reach our target, we had to refuel in midair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; <img alt="656279.jpg" height="266" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring 2016/Devotional Graphics/Picture3.png" width="374" /> &nbsp;</p>
<p>This activity requires great skill and more than a little nerve as you maneuver a massive aircraft to within a few feet of another massive aircraft and connect to a refueling boom while flying at hundreds of miles per hour, thousands of feet in the air. During daylight it is difficult enough. On this night, if I recall correctly, it was dark, we were in the clouds, and we faced turbulence. We had no choice but to persevere if we were to accomplish our mission. That in-flight refueling was only one of five we would need to complete before our mission was accomplished.</p>
<p>At last we reached Iraq. We slipped through enemy air defenses apparently undetected and released our weapons on time, on target.</p>
<p>After leaving Baghdad, we still had a harrowing journey ahead of us&mdash;the return home was about as long as the flight there, only now we would feel the effects of our long flight even more. There was a danger that while one pilot rested, the pilot flying would fall asleep due to exhaustion. We droned on through the night and into the next day. Nearly 36 hours after we departed, we arrived safely home, exhausted and relieved.</p>
<p>Like a stealth bomber mission, our lives are contests of endurance and perseverance. Stealth pilots must endure some of the most grueling tests in aviation&mdash;to stay alert and vigilant through difficult circumstances. The stealth bomber must fly through enemy airspace to accomplish its mission. It cannot completely avoid the threat posed by a well-armed enemy. Instead, it relies on careful planning, knowing how to avoid being detected by the enemy even while in the midst of the threat.</p>
<p>You must also navigate a perilous route through life if you are to accomplish the Lord's purposes for you. We live in a world filled with opposition from all around us. You cannot completely avoid the threats you will face in life, no matter how carefully you try. Part of the Lord's plan of happiness was for us to face opposition.<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> We are blessed to be a part of the BYU-Idaho community, where we are surrounded by people who are doing their best to live the gospel. Yet each of us at times must navigate through seemingly overwhelming opposition in our lives. We suffer heartache, sorrow, discouragement, and sin. We must learn great endurance if we are to fulfill God's purposes in our lives.</p>
<p>When I was in your shoes as a young person, I faced two kinds of opposition some of you may be facing in your lives right now. I doubted my testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel, and I felt great guilt for things I had done wrong in my life. Perhaps you are struggling with questions you have about the gospel. Perhaps you are struggling with feelings of unworthiness or guilt. We are all destined to struggle from time to time in our lives. Whatever you may be struggling with, I hope you find courage and strength to endure your personal trials and joy in the hope the gospel brings. And not just joy in some distant future but joy today in the middle of your struggle, whatever it may be.</p>
<p>Just before the start of my mission to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, I began to doubt my testimony of the gospel. I worried a lot about it. Did I really know the gospel was true? How could I know it? I believed I had received a spiritual witness of the truth, but I worried that the testimony I had was not enough. I began to allow my doubts to consume my thoughts. I felt that I was applying all of the correct principles required to gain a testimony. I turned to the scriptures and found only occasional comfort. I spent hours into the night on my knees, desperately seeking a greater witness of the truth. I tried being perfectly obedient in all things. I guess you could say I was trying to force the Lord to answer my prayers on my terms rather than accept the Lord's terms.</p>
<p>My struggle lasted for years, off and on. At times I would feel as though there was no hope for me, that other people could be happy in the gospel but that I was doomed to wander in doubt, feeling unworthy of God's notice. Over time I began to realize that it's okay to believe the gospel<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, that "a testimony is a spiritual witness given by the Holy Ghost,"<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>&nbsp;that spiritual knowledge is different from physical knowledge, and that both are equally valid. You can trust your spiritual knowledge. It is every bit as valid as other kinds of knowledge we acquire.</p>
<p>Nephi was one of the greatest prophets of the Book of Mormon. He saw visions, performed miracles, was carried away to high mountains on the wings of the Holy Spirit. So, it's easy to overlook the humble beginnings of Nephi's testimony. When Nephi was still young, he had a desire to know that what his father was telling him was true. So, he sought to find out for himself. It sounds to me like Nephi was inquisitive and had his own questions. What he did to find answers to those questions can teach us a lot about what we can do when we have our own questions. In his own words Nephi says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I, Nephi,...having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn4" title="">[4]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn4" title=""></a>What can we learn from Nephi's experience gaining a testimony of his father's words? He says the Lord softened his heart that he did "believe all the words which had been spoken" by his father. Imagine what that was like for Nephi. No angel. No vision. No miraculous manifestation other than the miracle of the Holy Ghost whispering to his heart it was okay to believe what his father had told him. I imagine all he received was a good feeling that what his father was telling him was true. At this point, did Nephi have a testimony? Of course he did.</p>
<p>That spiritual knowledge was enough for Nephi to leave his home, his friends, and his worldly possessions and head into the wilderness with his visionary father. He did not rebel like his brothers did, and I believe that made all the difference in Nephi's life. After receiving a simple witness through a softening of his heart, Nephi followed his father's words. I have received precious spiritual witnesses throughout my life, most of which have come through simple good feelings.</p>
<p>During his October 2007 General Conference address, Elder Douglas L. Callister shared the following story about young Heber J. Grant:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"When the 23-year-old Heber J. Grant was installed as president of the Tooele Stake, he told the Saints he believed the gospel was true. President Joseph F. Smith, a counselor in the First Presidency, inquired, 'Heber, you said you believe the gospel with all your heart,...but you did not bear your testimony that you know it is true. Don't you know absolutely that this gospel is true?'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Heber answered, 'I do not.' Joseph F. Smith then turned to John Taylor, the President of the Church, and said, 'I am in favor of undoing this afternoon what we did this morning. I do not think any man should preside over a stake who has not a perfect and abiding knowledge of the divinity of this work.'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"President Taylor replied, 'Joseph, Joseph, Joseph, [Heber] knows it just as well as you do. The only thing that he does not know is that he does know it.'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Within a few weeks that testimony was realized, and young Heber J. Grant shed tears of gratitude for the perfect, abiding, and absolute testimony that came into his life."<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn5" title=""></a>From the time the missionaries first taught me the gospel, I believed it. I had seen the hand of God in my life. But I lacked understanding. I began to confuse spiritual knowledge with physical knowledge. I worried that I needed definitive proof for all of my questions all at once rather than allowing my testimony to grow with my experience, gradually over time.</p>
<p>Alma the Younger gave some great instruction on growing a personal testimony over time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn6" title=""></a>Alma suggests an experiment. I love experiments! This experiment begins with a particle of faith&mdash;nothing more&mdash;a simple desire to believe. In my life this desire to believe has been a strength and comfort to me during times when I have struggled with hard questions I could not find immediate answers to. I love how Alma teaches us that the beginning of our testimonies is a desire to believe, followed by an experiment on the word. In other words, we have to want a testimony, and we have to do something with the gospel knowledge we have gained. And even after we see that the word is good, we cannot expect to have a perfect knowledge right away.<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> These early experiments serve to increase our faith. There is nothing wrong with having faith and believing as you work to gain a deeper and stronger testimony of the truth.</p>
<p>Alma goes on to describe the care and effort required to nurture a testimony from a seedling to one that bears fruit. I think part of Alma's message is that it takes time, patience, and diligence to grow a testimony from a desire to believe to a sure knowledge. Be patient with the Lord and with yourself as you strive to build your testimony.</p>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, in the October 2013 General Conference, said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It's natural to have questions&mdash;the acorn of honest inquiry has often sprouted and matured into a great oak of understanding. There are few members of the Church who, at one time or another, have not wrestled with serious or sensitive questions. One of the purposes of the Church is to nurture and cultivate the seed of faith&mdash;even in the sometimes sandy soil of doubt and uncertainty. Faith is to hope for things which are not seen but which are true.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters&mdash;my dear friends&mdash;please, first doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith. We must never allow doubt to hold us prisoner and keep us from the divine love, peace, and gifts that come through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn8" title="">[8]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn8" title=""></a>When I was younger, I wanted a once-and-for-all testimony. I didn't want to work at growing my testimony over a lifetime. But it hasn't been that way for me. I question and challenge ideas. I wonder about a lot of things. But through my experiences, I never stopped trying my best to live the gospel. I didn't use my questions or concerns as excuses for not keeping the commandments. Rather, they motivated me to try harder. Trials come to all of us. We get to choose how we will respond to them.</p>
<p>If you are seeking a greater witness of the truth, or if you are struggling with doctrinal questions, be patient. Trust the Lord. He may not provide every answer you want when you want it. As a teacher, some of my students find my methods frustrating. I try not to answer students' questions in class. I've found that it's easy to tell students answers to their questions, but true understanding can only come to the learner through the individual's struggle to acquire it. When you struggle to gain knowledge for yourself, you will retain it better and longer. Why should gaining spiritual knowledge be any different? As you persevere in the effort to gain or strengthen your personal testimony, your spiritual knowledge of the truth will grow.</p>
<p>Accept the Lord's blessings. Give yourself permission to be happy as you wait upon the Lord. Find joy in the midst of struggle by learning to accept the Lord's will and gladly wait for answers to come. It's okay to be happy even as you struggle to gain your spiritual footing. If answers don't come right away, be patient, persevere, and give yourself permission to be happy while you wait.</p>
<p>I recently had a mote in my eye. I would not have thought of it that way, but it truly was a mote. A tiny, almost invisible sliver stuck under my eyelid. It wasn't painful, but it was uncomfortable, like an eyelash stuck in my eye, except it wouldn't flush out. My wife couldn't see it. I couldn't see it. It bothered me most when I tried to sleep at night. It would keep me up, just scratching and irritating me. I wondered how it would be if I had to go the rest of my life with this irritation in my eye. Finally, after about a week, I called an optometrist to see if he could help me. It was a Saturday, and they were closing in a few minutes. I hurried to get to his office before he closed for the weekend. I didn't wait. The doctor everted my eyelid (which means he flipped my eyelid inside out), examined my eye, and found a couple of tiny slivers. He seemed unsure whether they were really even the cause of the problem because they were so small. He applied a numbing agent and then plucked the slivers from my eye. I felt instant relief. I was so grateful that I could close my eye without discomfort. It made me wish I had gone to see the doctor a week earlier, when I first discovered the problem.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a mote in your eye spiritually? Do you have one now? Are you waiting to have it removed? Why are you waiting? When we have done something wrong in our lives that requires us to sincerely seek forgiveness, it's hard to confess to those whom we have offended or to our bishop. You may even think if you wait long enough the need to fully repent will go away, but it doesn't. Just as I felt such complete relief after the doctor removed the mote from my eye, if you are waiting to repent, make up your mind and act now so you can experience similar relief in your spiritual life.</p>
<p>Our family has a set of leather couches in our living room. They are nothing special, but as the one who has to replace things that wear out, I probably show more concern for them than I should. One day I noticed that someone had scratched a work of art into one of the seat cushions on the couch.</p>
<p><img alt="Dallin couch damage.jpg" height="491" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring 2016/Devotional Graphics/Picture4.png" width="491" /> &nbsp; <br /><br />After a little deductive reasoning, I called my youngest son, Dallin, who was four at the time, to come and discuss this damage to the furniture with me. Our conversation went something like this:</p>
<p>Me: "Who did this to the couch?" <br />Dallin: "What will happen to the person who did it?" <br />Me: "I will love them even more." <br />Dallin: (very quickly) "It was me!"</p>
<p>Sometimes my students stray outside the boundaries of the Honor Code in their coursework. Sometimes they are not even aware that what they are doing is dishonest. They may even believe they are helping each other. Some have helped each other on take-home exams. Others have shared work with their friends, who then submitted it as their own or "tweaked" it to help themselves feel better about turning it in. Some of the most treasured moments in my teaching here have come during the conversations with these students after they have cheated in my classes.</p>
<p>During one such conversation, a student expressed his doubt that the gospel was true and told me he was considering dropping out of college. He was making a lot of money as a sales person and felt he would be just as successful without a college degree. I offered my encouragement and shared my testimony with him. Months later, I received the following message from him:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Oftentimes I think about the talk...we had in your office. Honestly, it has been [such a] treasure to me. It has literally changed my perspective towards what I really want and what is the most important thing in my life. I couldn't thank you enough for the guidance and help. I am coming back to graduate in the winter semester.</p>
<p>That conversation is a treasure to me as well.</p>
<p>You may feel alone, afraid, ashamed of what you've done. It takes courage to do the right thing. It takes even more courage to come forward when we have messed up. The Lord rejoices when we repent. Teachers, bishops, and parents also rejoice. We know it's hard to do. We've had to do it ourselves. When you allow others to help you repent, they will love you even more.</p>
<p>You may find that you have developed a habit that you wish you hadn't. You want to change, but you just seem to return to the bad behavior in moments of weakness. You recognize the need to change but find it difficult, seemingly impossible to do. Do not despair. You are not alone. It's okay to get help from people who love you and are cheering for you. There is a big difference between repeatedly slipping up and rebelling against God.</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf has said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It matters not how completely ruined our lives may seem. It matters not how scarlet our sins, how deep our bitterness, how lonely, abandoned, or broken our hearts may be. Even those who are without hope, who live in despair, who have betrayed trust, surrendered their integrity, or turned away from God can be rebuilt...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The joyous news of the gospel is this: because of the eternal plan of happiness provided by our loving Heavenly Father and through the infinite sacrifice of Jesus the Christ, we can not only be redeemed from our fallen state and restored to purity, but we can also transcend mortal imagination and become heirs of eternal life and partakers of God's indescribable glory.<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn9" title="">[9]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn9" title=""></a>It's easy to see others and think you are the only one who needs to repent. That is simply not true. We are all fallen and lost.<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> And we are all here to help each other. You are warriors in the great battle between good and evil. The adversary's forces are well armed. They are well organized. The Lord's forces are more powerful and better armed. I am reminded of the account of Elisha and his servant, when they were surrounded by a fearsome enemy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.<br /><br /> And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn11" title="">[11]</a></p>
<p>The angels of God stand beside you, even as you continually struggle with doubt and sin. You are not going to become perfect in this life. So why even try? Because the great blessing of life is in the struggle to become what God wants us to become. It's not in having more, getting more, or even in being more&mdash;it's in becoming more each day. The growth comes through the struggle, not in spite of it. So don't give up. When you mess up again and feel that you will never be able to overcome whatever weakness you are trying to overcome, keep going!<a href="/devotionals/bill-crawford#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> Eventually you will make it.</p>
<p>Just as your testimony is not a one-time event, neither is repentance. The Lord has given us time to work through our weakness, sorrows, pain, and doubt. He will not leave you comfortless. The Savior has paid the full price for all of our sins. He sent loving family, friends, leaders, and teachers to strengthen us during times of doubt and to help us find our way back when we are lost.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the trials of my faith. Through them, I have gained greater knowledge of gospel truths. Brothers and sisters, the Lord knows each of us individually. He knows our strengths and our weaknesses, our hopes, dreams, fears, and sorrows. He knows our hearts. He allows us to make mistakes so we can learn from them, and He continues to love us, for He knows who we really are and what our true potential is. He paid the price for each of us to return to Him. I know that this gospel is true through the witness of the Holy Ghost. Jesus is the Christ. We have a living prophet today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /><br />Good evening, and thank you, Brother Woodruff from the Church Educational System, President and Sister Gilbert, and friends and families of the Brigham Young University-Idaho class of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />And to you distinguished graduates, I'm honored to be a part of this singular event in your lives.<br /><br /><strong>Commendation and Congratulations</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>I commend and congratulate each of you for the work you have done. You made it! You're here to participate in this great event we call commencement. <br /><br />I love that word-<em>commencement</em>. In my mind I see a clean slate, an unmarked canvas.<br /><br />And now is your time to consider what you are going to make of your new beginning. This is your New Year's Day, one of my favorite holidays; it just arrived a few months early. This is your time to make a fresh start with unlimited possibilities. The past is in the rearview mirror. The future is bright and exciting. Today can be a New Year's Day you will never forget.<br /><br /><strong>My Topic</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Several months ago, shortly after receiving the invitation to speak here today, I overheard a conversation between my oldest daughter, Emily, and my wife, Julie. Emily shared the frustration she felt with some things a friend had said to her. </p>
<p>In response, my wife gave Emily, a young mother, some wise counsel on which voices we should listen to and which we should not. Today, I would like to use the thoughts I've had as a result of that simple conversation-thoughts of listening to the right voices in life-as the basis for my message.<br /><br /><strong>My Family</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Julie and I have six children. Emily is our oldest. Four of the six are married. We have nine grandchildren and are eager for that number to grow. Our son Joseph recently returned from his mission in Spain, and our youngest, Deanna, just graduated from high school. As I said, Julie and I are eager for more grandchildren. If anyone would like to meet Joseph or Deanna, please talk to my wife. She'll ask you some probing questions and then make the appropriate introductions. She has quite a record as a successful matchmaker. &nbsp; <strong>The Voice</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>One thing you might be interested to know about Deanna is that she enjoys watching dance and music shows on television with her mom. One of their favorites is the series <em>The Voice</em>. I imagine many of you are familiar with it. For those who are not, let me explain the format. On <em>The Voice</em>, contestants sing to four judges who have their backs turned to them. If the judges are pleased by the sound of a singer's voice, they push a button that rotates their chair so they can see the face of the person with the pleasing voice. If they feel otherwise, they simply do not rotate their chairs.<br /><br />The judges are all professional musicians who have developed the skill of recognizing voices the masses will be drawn to. These experts have learned to recognize uniqueness and potential in a singing voice. <br /><br />Even though we know <em>The Voice</em> is designed to entertain, perhaps there is something useful we can learn from it. For example, you might ask yourself, "How much time do I spend discerning among the voices I hear in my life? How do I decide which voices to turn my chair around for and which to turn away from or tune out?"<br /><br />For the next 19 minutes, you will be listening to my voice. As you do, I invite you to do four tasks. <br /><br />One: Look back upon the various voices that have affected your life to this point.</p>
<p>Two: Look forward and embrace the voices of the Lord and His disciples that will influence you in the coming years. </p>
<p>Three: Reflect upon how you might respond to the voices of the world.</p>
<p>Four: Consider the power that your voice will have for good in the lives of those around you.<br /><br /><strong>Voices of Teachers</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Because of your presence here today, I can confidently assert that you have listened to some wise voices over the past few years as you have been instructed by the BYU-Idaho faculty. You have also been blessed as you have listened to the inspired voices of President and Sister Gilbert. May the voices of your teachers and leaders here on this beautiful campus continue to lift and inspire you in the coming years.<br /><br /> &shy; As I reflect upon my time as a BYU undergraduate student, I can still hear the voice of Don Norton advising me on English usage: should I use <em>further</em> or <em>farther</em>, <em>that</em> or <em>which</em>, and so on? And I can hear the voice of Rand Packard as he taught me-a young college student-the principles of gospel teaching. I also hear the unique sound of the voice of Susan Easton Black, who expanded my knowledge of the Prophet Joseph Smith during my class time with her. <br /><br />How grateful I am for my university professors-grateful for the knowledge gained and the inspiration felt as I listened to their voices.<br /><br />As you reflect on your education here at BYU-Idaho, what voices do you hear? Who comes to mind as you think back on the voices that have significantly impacted you during your experience here? Think of what they said, think of how they said it, and think of how you felt as you listened to their voices. <br /><br /><strong>Voices of Family</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Now let's take a few minutes and reflect upon the voices you heard in your home-most often the voices of your siblings and parents-and how those voices encouraged you, counseled you, and comforted you-and how today those same voices will congratulate you.<br /><br />My mother passed away in 2011. Her voice meant much to me for too many reasons to name. But here is just one example: I enjoyed playing basketball as a boy. And when we pursue excellence in any field, particularly when we are young, self-doubt can be a nagging companion. It was for me.<br /><br />My mom didn't understand the intricacies of basketball strategy, but she did know that the team with the most points wins the game and the way to score points is to make baskets. I loved to hear the voice of my mother when she would say before each game, "Now, Devin, don't forget to shoot!" That was her way of saying, "I believe in you! You can do it!" Her vote of confidence meant the world to me. <br /><br />Seek out voices of those, within your family and elsewhere, who lift you in honest and sincere ways. And strive to be that positive voice for others.<br /><br />My dad also built my self-image. I needed him to help me feel good about myself, and he delivered. <br /><br />As a young boy, I remember many times while I was working side by side with my dad on various projects, he would say to me, "Having you help is like having a man." Each time he said that, he helped me feel good about myself. Even at that young age, I was aware enough to realize I wasn't doing the work a man could do. But my father's words overrode all logic and made me feel confident. His words made me want to work harder, to work more like a grown man. He made me feel that I had something to contribute, not only to the task we were working on but in all aspects of my life.<br /><br />During my boyhood and to this day, my dad has always been generous in his praise. Throughout my life, his voice has helped me believe that I was capable of accomplishing much. <br /><br />I am reminded of the words of Dale Carnegie.&nbsp; He said, "Nothing else so inspires and heartens people as words of appreciation. You and I may soon forget the words of encouragement and appreciation that we utter now, but the person to whom we have spoken them may treasure them and repeat them to themselves over a lifetime." </p>
<p>You have been taught much and will do much teaching of your own. What lessons will you teach, and what will your learners hear and learn?&nbsp; Over the course of your lifetime, what will people remember from your voice?<br /><br />As a parent, you can have a profound influence on your children's confidence, as my parents did. You will want to give your children many things and open up many opportunities. You will work hard to provide food and shelter. Yet what will be of greatest worth is your affirmation to each child that he or she is loved and important and capable of excelling in many ways. You, as a parent, more than any other person, will be the mirror into which your child will look to determine his or her self-worth.<br /><br />Sadly, the voices we hear as we look back may, in some cases, bring pain as well as memories of harsh, critical, or hurtful words. As hard as we may try, painful words are difficult to set aside, or perhaps the communication we think back on was lacking in other ways.</p>
<p>My father recently told me something I hadn't heard before about his father, my grandfather. My father said that during his growing-up years, he would work alongside my grandfather for hours without Grandfather speaking to him. My grandfather chose to keep his thoughts to himself.&nbsp; That must have been hard on my father. How blessed I was that my father chose to take a different approach with me.&nbsp; I needed his supportive voice as a young boy, and I need it today.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fortunately, there was a voice in his life that lifted and inspired my father to great accomplishments. That voice was his mother's. She was a positive and loving woman who helped my father find his way in life.<br /><br />Whether the voices of your past fill you with joy or with pain, as you make your new beginning, consider the impact that your voice-or your silence-can have on others for both good and bad. Your voice can lift those with whom you interact, or it can pull them down.</p>
<p>Your voice, along with the voice of your spouse, will be the primary source from which your children will learn the gospel of Jesus Christ. A month ago, I spent a week pondering and memorizing the key elements of a verse that spoke of the effect of a father's voice on a son. Listen to this familiar reflection: "I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart" (Enos 1:3).<br /><br />Jacob's voice changed Enos' life in a wonderful way.&nbsp; Centuries later, we are still learning from this powerful scripture.<br /><br />In the Old Testament, we are counseled on how to use our voices to teach our children. Consider this verse:&nbsp; speaking of God's commandments, Moses said to the Israelites, "Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up" (Deuteronomy 6:7).<br /><br />How will you use your voice to teach your children? How will you use your voice to interact with your spouse, your friends, and others with whom you associate?<br /><br /><strong>Voices of the World</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Just as Julie counseled Emily, let me caution you about the world's voices. These voices surround us. They can be loud and obnoxious, concealed and cowardly, or subtle and deceptive. Sadly, I must acknowledge that the voices of the world seem to be having some success in changing hearts. This is not a new trend, but it is a concerning one. You'll remember these words from Lehi's dream: "After they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost" (1 Nephi 8:28).<br /><br />Are you tempted to listen when the "scoffing" voice is directed at you, or do you keep that voice at your back?<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Word Games</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>I enjoy playing with words and their meanings in order to make a point. <br /><br />Consider these ideas:</p>
<p>The word <em>voice</em> minus one letter becomes the word <em>vice</em>: <em>v</em>-<em>i</em>-<em>c</em>-<em>e</em>. A vice is another word for a bad habit. Can we say that listening to the wrong voices can lead us to vices?<br /><br />How about this one?<br /><br />A <em>vise</em>, <em>v</em>-<em>i</em>-<em>s</em>-<em>e</em>, is a tool that grips an object, restricting the movement of that object. Isn't that what happens when we develop a vice, <em>v</em>-<em>i</em>-<em>c</em>-<em>e</em>, in our lives: our freedom is restricted by the strong grasp that binds us? And it all starts by listening to and heeding the wrong voices.<br /><br />I offer one more word twist. If we start with the word <em>voice</em>, remove the <em>v</em>, and replace it with a <em>ch</em>, we end up with <em>choice</em>. Isn't that one of God's greatest gifts to His children-the ability to make our own choices in life? <br /><br />So, in order to avoid the grip of a vise that comes with the development of a vice, we must strive to make the right choice, to listen to the right voice.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Fear, Negativity, and Evil</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Many of the world's voices seek to limit your choices and to negatively influence the way you think, feel, and live. So it is up to you to choose which voices you will heed. <br /><br />You are your own judge on <em>The Voice</em>. You get to decide when to turn your chair around and when not to. Now comes the question: "How will I know which voices to listen to and which to ignore?" Sometimes the answer to that question is easy, but sometimes it is difficult. Always we must proceed with caution.<br /><br />Three loud voices the world presents, among others, are the voices of fear, negativity, and evil.<br /><br /><strong>Fear </strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Doctrine and Covenants 6:36 provides an answer to the voice of fear: "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not."&nbsp; It helps me when I reverse the order of the elements of that verse: fear not, doubt not by looking unto me in every thought.<br /><br /><strong>Negativity</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Please don't listen to the voice of negativity. It is becoming more prevalent in the world. Shun discouraging or negative voices that pull you down.<br /><br />One of my favorite poems, "Promise Yourself," includes this promise "to talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet."&nbsp; Remember that positivity can drown out negativity.<br /><br /><strong>Evil</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The Holy Ghost is a powerful tool in recognizing the voice of evil. <br /><br />Consider these words of caution from Mormon: "O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!" (Helaman 12:4)&nbsp; <br /><br />The prophet Alma helps us see the difference between listening to the voice of evil and the voice of goodness: "If a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him" (Alma 5:41).<br /><br />As we heed the voice of the Holy Ghost, we distance ourselves from the voices of fear, negativity, and evil.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hearing Aids</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Let me share with you a fun story I found about listening-about hearkening to voices-and the consequences that follow.<br /><br />An old lady had a hearing aid fitted, and she hid it underneath her hair.<br /><br />A week later, she returned to the doctor for her checkup.<br /><br />"It's wonderful; I can hear everything now," she happily reported to the doctor.<br /><br />"And is your family pleased too?" he asked.<br /><br />"Oh, I haven't told them yet," said the old lady. "And I've changed my will twice already."<br /><br />What a blessing it is to be able to hear. Sometimes, however, I wonder if those who wear hearing aids don't have a slight advantage over those who don't need them. You see, with a hearing aid, you can adjust the volume. You can also remove it or turn it off to block out the voice of the world.<br /><br />But we don't need hearing aids to tune out certain voices; we need self-discipline: the ability to choose to listen to righteous voices and block the voices of evil, to choose to keep our chairs unturned.<br /><br />You might mimic the advantages of having a hearing aid by simply asking yourself, "Is this voice inviting me to come closer to my Savior, to act more like Him?" Additionally, if there is a voice in your life that is urging you to follow a questionable path, I implore you to turn down the volume and change course immediately.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Voice of God</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>I think we can agree that it is critical to listen to the voice of God as we navigate through life's channels, but it may not always be easy to distinguish God's voice from other voices.</p>
<p>Consider young Samuel's experience in the Old Testament. He didn't know what the voice of God sounded like. Yet, with Eli's help, he learned. We read "that the Lord called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.<br /><br />"And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</p>
<p>"And the Lord called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</p>
<p>"Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him.</p>
<p>"And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child.<br /><br />"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.<br /><br />"And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth" (1 Samuel 3:4-10).<br /><br />It took four times for Samuel to recognize the Lord's voice.<br /><br />Here is another example from the Book of Mormon. Listen for the word <em>voice</em> in the following verses, and notice how the voice, which is not understood at first, comes to be understood:<br /><br />"While they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.<br /><br />"And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood it not.<br /><br />"And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their ears to hear it. . . . </p>
<p>"And they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them:<br /><br />"Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name-hear ye him" (3 Nephi 11:3-7).<br /><br />It was not until the third time that the people "[opened] their ears to hear it." How do you "open [your] ears" to <em>hear </em>what God is saying to you?<br /><br />We all need to strive to recognize God's voice. At times, it may take extra effort to hear Him speak to us through the Holy Ghost. But that effort is worth it.<br /><br />Heavenly Father wants us to reach out to Him. He wants to speak to us. How do we recognize His voice?&nbsp; <br /><br />When a news reporter asked President Gordon B. Hinckley how he communicated with God, the prophet responded, "I think the best way I could describe the process is to liken it to the experience of Elijah...Elijah spoke to the Lord, and there was a wind, a great wind, and the Lord was not in the wind. And there was an earthquake, and the Lord was not in the earthquake. And there was a fire, and the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire a still, small voice, which I describe as the whisperings of the Spirit" ("This Thing Was Not Done in a Corner," Ensign, Nov. 1996, 51).<br /><br />The Lord's voice will not necessarily be loud, obvious, or spectacular.&nbsp; Instead, it may be soft-still and small. For that reason, we need to be sensitive to His voice. He can speak to us when we are willing to listen. We hear His voice when we are at peace.&nbsp; We hear His voice when we approach Him with a broken heart and a contrite spirit. We hear His voice when we find ourselves in holy places and when we participate in holy activities. <br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>My Seat</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>My dear friends, do not turn for the unrighteous voices we hear.&nbsp; Instead, surround yourselves with voices of wisdom, charity, mercy, and faithfulness.<br /><br />I have a great seat at general conference. You can't miss me. I'm the tall one who seems out of place on the rostrum (that happens when you are 6'7"). To my right sits the Young Men general presidency. To my left is the Sunday School general president, Tad Callister, along with his other counselor, Brian Ashton. Next to our presidency is the Relief Society general presidency. One row in front of us is the Presiding Bishopric, and in front of them sit the First Presidency and several Apostles. Behind us is a row of General Authorities. And behind that row is the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. <br /><br />I am very safe at general conference! I love the voices that surround me-they teach and inspire me. The voice of the Holy Ghost is clear in this setting, as Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, speak through Their chosen servants. And the choir fills my soul.<br /><br />Who surrounds you each day? Who is in front of you, behind you, to your side? What voices do you listen to most often? Your answer to these questions will change in the coming days. For many of you, the routine of going to class each day is over. New voices will be heard as you adopt new routines.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Voice-Let It Be Heard</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Before my voice fades away tonight, let me invite you to be a voice of love, reason, and clarity-a powerful voice for good and right. <br /><br />You've all heard of the "silent majority"? How would you describe that group? Perhaps as a passive group whose voice is quiet while the "vocal minority" uses its voice to advance its causes.</p>
<p>The Lord counseled, "Open your mouths," or in other words, speak up. Use your voices. He promises that if we do, our mouths "shall be filled" (D&amp;C 33:8). This promise was given in a missionary context.&nbsp; Many of you have experienced the reality of this promise. But can we not apply it to other settings when a voice of goodness is needed?<br /><br />Lift up your voice to oppose wrong. If we don't lift our voices, we will be drowned out by the voices of the world. The Lord declared that we need to let our voice be heard and that He will strengthen us as we do.<br /><br />He said, "At all times, and in all places, he shall open his mouth and declare my gospel as with the voice of a trump, both day and night. And I will give unto him strength such as is not known among men" (D&amp;C 24:12). <br /><br />This verse of scripture, along with others, invites us to boldly open our mouths (see, for example, D&amp;C 30:5). We are also invited to listen to the voice of God.<br /><br />I love this clear and direct invitation: "Hearken and listen to the voice of him who is from all eternity to all eternity, the Great I Am, even Jesus Christ" (D&amp;C 39:1).<br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>May I invite you to reflect on and discuss the counsel my wife gave to my oldest daughter?&nbsp; You might ask yourself, "How can I more effectively choose which voices to heed and which to leave behind?"<br /><br />As we go forth from this celebratory event, may we all choose to lift a voice for good inside and outside our homes as we earnestly strive to listen for, hear, and follow His voice-the right voice: the voice of God. And as we do, He will be at our side.</p>
<p>My very best wishes to each of you as you commence a new chapter in your lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p>On September 4, 1971, Marianne Olsen was born full term, without any complications. She was perfect. She had dark eyes and brown hair.  My mom thought she looked a lot like me.  In the first few days there were concerns, however: she was pale and seemed to have a hard time breathing, which made it hard for her to eat. Though reassured by the doctors that she would be fine, my mother continued to worry. Thirteen days after she was born, in deep concern for my sister's condition, my father rushed my mom and Marianne to the University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City. Within two hours of arriving, Marianne was dead. She was diagnosed with a critical congenital heart defect, a rare condition, which affects four babies in ten thousand, that can easily be repaired today, but at that time medical teams did not know what to do to save her. No words can describe the anguish my mother and father felt. Though I was young, I remember the weight of sadness that burdened my parents&mdash;especially my mom. After Marianne passed, the nurses wrapped her body in a white blanket and put her in my mother's arms to transport back to Brigham City. I have often thought of what my mother must have felt, holding her deceased little one on the hour-long drive back home. I doubt many words were said but rather a sacred silence of both pain and the Spirit of God that accompanied my parents home.<br /><br />Through the history of the gospel and everyday life, pain and suffering could be a daily occurrence for all of us. There are those now, within the listening ear of my voice, that have deep burdens that are both sacred and silent&mdash;silent, perhaps, to those who are near, but not silent to Heavenly Father. Still, in those "alone" moments, we might ask, "O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?" (D&amp;C 121:1) And yet, even in the moment of loss, even in the moment of loneliness and despair, my mother was not alone.  Nor are we.  In these dark times, it is important to remember our baptismal covenants and the promise in the sacramental prayer "that they may always have his Spirit to be with them" (D&amp;C 20:77). <br /><br />In his address in the April 2012 general conference, President Henry B. Eyring said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If we have faith in Jesus Christ, the hardest as well as the easiest times in life can be a blessing. In all conditions, we can choose the right with the guidance of the Spirit. We have the gospel of Jesus Christ to shape and guide our lives if we choose it. And with prophets revealing to us our place in the plan of salvation, we can live with perfect hope and a feeling of peace. We never need feel that we are alone or unloved in the Lord's service because we never are. We can feel the love of God. The Savior has promised angels on our left and our right to bear us up. And He always keeps His word.</p>
<p>Our eternal progression, our capacity to grow and to learn to become sons and daughters of God, is deeply coupled with our capacity to do hard things.  As we learn to ponder the Atonement through the lenses of the Restoration of the gospel and exercise even "a particle of faith," (Alma 32:27) our ability to grow and "yield...to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and [put] off the natural man and [become] a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and [become] as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord [sees] fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father" (Mosiah 3:19) starts to be realized&mdash;not necessarily all at once, but like the light in the morning dawn, it may be an imperceptible change but nevertheless an increase of light.   &nbsp;<br /><br />Therefore, it is not that trials will come but rather our disposition to those trials when they do come. Though Laman and his group left their home, traveling years and thousands of miles, they never left their Jerusalem. Do we travel the long path of discipleship only to realize we are walking in circles, too busy looking outward, feeling forgotten, rather than looking upward, "[being] still and [knowing He is] God," (Psalm 46:10) recognizing of course that, in the moment of hard things, it takes greater faith to lift our heads heavenward? But it is "in the furnace of affliction" (Isaiah 48:10) that we are refined.&nbsp; What a tragedy: to suffer the affliction, "to be proved in all things," (Abraham 3:25) only to miss the refining process. <br /><br />Isaiah teaches us, "Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction" (Isaiah 48:10).<br /><br />Four years ago, my husband and I were called to be over our ward trek, held in Wyoming at&nbsp;Martin's Cove. We have a large number of youth in our ward; when we made the reservations, the missionaries in charge of scheduling&nbsp;actually thought we were a stake. Even though our youth in the ward were extraordinary, our bishop realized the value of experiencing hard things for understanding and learning the gospel principles. We really wanted the youth to understand, if only minimally, a portion of the hardship that the pioneers faced. As we planned the activities, we tried to add challenges&mdash;not to discourage but to encourage our youth to increase their faith to know they could do hard things. <br /><br />We departed early from our Harvest Hills ward house at around 4:30 in the morning. We traveled 12 hours east through Western Wyoming until we landed with three buses and 120 youth at Martin's Cove.   &nbsp;<br /><br />Though wearied from travel, a meal and square dance were on the schedule. Around 7:00 p.m., the youth gathered with their assigned families and were instructed to prepare to start the trek. &nbsp;<br /><br />There was a lot of energy and high spirits as each family loaded up their handcarts and lined up for our trek in the wilderness.  By design, the youth didn't know how far our camp was when we took to the trail. There was laughter and singing of pioneer songs, but after the first hour, things started to quiet down. I'm sure the youth were all wondering at this point, "Are we there yet?" We trekked on for yet another hour. The shadows had grown past being distinguished from the light and had melted into dusk when we pulled up to an overlook of the Sweetwater River. There, a short devotional was given from 1 Nephi 17:13: "And I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye shall know that it is by me that ye are led."<br /><br />The light from the dusk was all but gone. &nbsp;<br /><br />After the devotional, the exhausted youth were instructed that we had yet further to go.  "But the path is so dark," a youth commented. "How are we going to see to find our way?"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, on signal, the leaders handed each youth an industrial-strength glow stick to act as their "light in the wilderness" (1 Nephi 17:13) to navigate in the dark and to help see the path as they moved forward into the unknown. <br /><br />We expected there would be some grumbling and complaining, but it never surfaced. The youth seemed to understand the difficulty and sacredness of sacrifice. It was an amazing sight to see a line of yellow lights silently making their way along in the still, cool Wyoming night. One of our leaders, James Helfrich, reported,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I was pushing the cart at night with Ben Orchard. We didn't know where the road was going, how long we had been pulling, or even what time it was. We only knew that the trail was leading us forward. Why did we follow the trail rather than go our own way? We didn't know who made the road or even where it would take us! This road was a metaphor for our travels through mortality. Rarely does the Lord give us a roadmap. He gives us instead a glimpse of just a few feet ahead and faithful Saints to follow. If we trudge on with all our strength, if we follow our leaders and try to be an example to those behind us, we will reach the end.</p>
<p>The youth walked an additional two hours in the dark until they came to our campsite. One of the most difficult unsung tasks was completed by the four couples who had gone ahead and set up the tents&mdash;in the dark, in a windstorm, with 20-plus variations of tents, and they still prepared scones for when the youth arrived. Both the leaders and the youth did hard things. Although exhausted, the first leg of their journey in the wilderness was completed. It wasn't cut short for any reason, and it was endured well. The youth had accepted the challenge and accomplished this hard thing.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Neal A. Maxwell, in the April 1990 general conference, quoted Paul: "Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Such "peaceable fruit" comes only in the appointed season thereof, after the blossoms and the buds.&nbsp;<br /><br />One other particular challenge of our trek was very endearing to me.  It involved the women's pull.  For those of you who have never been to Martin's Cove, they have one steep, sandy stretch of a hill where only the women pull the handcarts. This was to simulate when the men were called to help in the war and left the women and children to continue the trek westward. This pull is difficult for the women. They have to steer and pull the loaded handcarts in the sand, up the hill, without the men's strength. This is a powerful experience, held in silence in respect for this sacred place. The men line up at the top and observe as the women pull. Once the handcart is pulled to the top, the young women run to help the next in line.&nbsp;<br /><br />When the pioneers crossed the plains, several sustained injuries or illnesses, making them unable to pull the handcarts. Their traveling companions had to help during these trying times. Our added challenge for this activity was to assign four of the strongest women to be assigned an affliction&mdash;such as a broken leg or fever&mdash;which would cause them to be pulled inside the handcart instead of helping to pull.  One of those assigned to be "afflicted" was the Young Women's leader Sister Angie Kivett. &nbsp;<br /><br />Angie was the backbone of all these young women; they looked to her for her incredible strength and direction, which she had gained from enduring hard things in her life. She was their cheerleader. She would have been the leader running from handcart to handcart helping to get them to the top.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the other "afflicted" was my daughter Rachel.&nbsp;Rachel is very athletic and very strong. I envision her as what I think the Nephite women were like.  She knew about and had looked forward to the women's pull, knowing that her strength would help get many of the handcarts to the top. During the trek, she was always found on the front of the handcart where the hardest work was. <br /><br />When she read her assignment, with tears welling up in her eyes, she looked towards her dad, who also had tears welling up in his eyes. He had chosen her specifically for this assignment. Rachel mouthed, shaking her head, "No, Dad...Don't make me do this...Don't make me do this."  Rachel knew she needed to help pull her handcart as the other young women assigned to her handcart were Beehives, small and not as muscularly developed. One of them was actually trekking in an orthopedic walking boot. The thought of them having to pull her in the cart, up the steep hill, was almost more than Rachel could bear. <br /><br />Obediently, Rachel, Sister Kivett, and a few others climbed into their handcarts and allowed the others to pull them up the steep and sandy hill. &nbsp;<br /><br />Even after four and a half years, this lesson of doing hard things is still very tender to Rachel.  Not being able to help was harder for her than if she would have had to pull the carts by herself. &nbsp;<br /><br />As I reflect on this experience, I wonder how many times we all shake our heads and plead with our Heavenly Father to "not make me do this" in regards to the hard things we are challenged with. &nbsp;<br /><br />Why do we have to go through hard things? Isn't it enough to just be obedient, say our prayers, read our scriptures, attend our church meetings? Do we have to have trials, especially when we are doing the things we think Heavenly Father wants us to do?&nbsp;<br /><br />When Elder David A. Bednar served as the president of BYU-Idaho, I attended a meeting he held with a group of students. One young sister asked, "President Bednar, I read my scriptures, I say my prayers, I attend my meetings, I go to the temple, and still I don't feel the spirit in my life. Why not?"&nbsp; He responded, "Well, do you stop reading your scriptures, do you stop saying your prayers, do you stop going to your Sunday meetings, do you stop going to the temple?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There are times where only Heavenly Father knows, and perhaps He has something else in mind that we can't see. <br /><br />Isaiah reminds us of this in chapter 55, verses 8 and 9:&nbsp;&nbsp;"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the&nbsp;Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your&nbsp;ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As I considered this topic of doing hard things for devotional, I was curious of what BYU-Idaho students would describe as "hard" things in their lives (besides the everyday expectations of school). I made a point of asking this question whenever I had a chance conversation with students. Here are a few of the responses:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that there are many other situations just like these that I didn't uncover. What I realized is that we all have hard things in our lives. I know within the sound of my voice there are those that seek comfort that perhaps have come to this devotional or are listening from somewhere. Take courage. "Lift up your hearts and rejoice,...gird up your loins,...take upon you my whole armor."</p>
<p>We are taught in Doctrine and Covenants 19:23, "Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me." We are promised in the Book of Mormon, Alma 36:3, "Behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day."&nbsp;<br /><br />We learn from our experiences, and when the next challenge comes, we use our experience to move forward with greater faith. These experiences teach us, much like Nephi learning to build a bow in preparation for needing to build a ship.<br /><br />We know that Heavenly Father has commanded us to do hard things: following the commandments is a hard thing, repenting is hard, saying you're sorry is hard, forgiving is a hard thing, honoring your parents can be a hard thing, being an example is hard. <br /><br />President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, in a recent Ensign article, reminds us that Heavenly Father has given us&nbsp;instructions to help us, which "work regardless of...age or circumstance" (Our Father, Our Mentor, <em>Ensign</em>, June 2016). We have the Church, the gospel of Jesus Christ, and the plan of salvation.  He assures us that Heavenly Father has not left us alone with all the uncertainties or challenges of life, saying, "Here you go. Good luck. Figure it out." &nbsp;<br /><br />A question also often asked is, why do we sometimes get several hard things thrown at us at once?  &nbsp;<br /><br />In his general conference address in 1995, Elder Richard G. Scott offered this insight: "Just when all seems to be going right, challenges often come in multiple doses applied simultaneously. When those trials are not consequences of your disobedience, they are evidence that the Lord feels you are prepared to grow more. He therefore gives you experiences that stimulate growth, understanding, and compassion which polish you for your everlasting benefit."<br /><br />Have you ever noticed this in your life? Your boyfriend or girlfriend breaks up with you, which makes you late for an important appointment. As you are hurrying, you have a fender bender, which is your fault. All these challenges seem to arrive simultaneously. We need to rely on our Heavenly Father to help us get through these experiences.  &nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Smith, while imprisoned in Liberty Jail, was reassured:&nbsp;"And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;C 122:7). &nbsp;<br /><br />What are the good things which come from trials? Can you list them? Here are a few:</p>
<p>My ward calling is currently with the Sunbeams.  Merriam-Webster dictionary defines <em>sunbeams</em> as "a ray of sunlight." These special little spirits haven't been away from their Father in Heaven for very long. Sunlight is warm and feels so good. What a perfect name for these little children. They are so honest and give the best answers. We learn foundational principles every week. I believe if I asked them how I should handle the hard things in my life, this is what they would teach me: the Holy Ghost will help you &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is great council from three-year-olds. I have been in nursery and Primary for the past eight years. It has not been a bad thing to be reminded to return to the basic gospel principles. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br /> I have a testimony that we have a loving Heavenly Father who, by design, has added unique challenges into each of our lives. He has given us examples to follow. He has given us the gospel of Jesus Christ and the plan of salvation. As much as we would like to shake our heads and ask Him not to make us do these hard things, we need to look upward, have faith, be obedient and persist. It is when we persist in the fiery furnace that we are refined, and the outcome is for our eternal benefit. No one is exempt. Jesus Christ, our heroes in the scriptures, Joseph Smith, the pioneers, our parents, and us. Heber J. Grant instructed us that the hard things that we persist in doing become easier not because of the nature of the hard things but because of our ability, which grows with every hard thing that we experience&nbsp;(Heber J. Grant: A Man Without Excuses, <em>New Era</em>, January 1972).<br /><br />I'm thankful for the gospel, for the Church, and for my family. I have experienced hard things and have learned from my family and friends as they have endured their challenges. I have been so blessed to have good examples in my life. I'm also thankful for the opportunity to be here at BYU-Idaho. I am inspired every day by the students and faculty who are doing hard things.&nbsp;<br /><br />It has been almost 45 years since the death of my little sister. My mom has been valiant in her testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ and has hung onto the hope of the plan of salvation. She has grown and had good things manifested within her. She made the comment many years ago that she didn't realize how long this life would seem without Marianne. Sometimes we look at this life as eternity, but there is a promised day where there will be no tears. "Though hard to you this journey may appear, / Grace shall be as your day" (Come, Come, Ye Saints, <em>Hymns</em>, No. 30).<br /><br />When you have tried everything and think you can't go any further, look upward. Remember a loving Heavenly Father who knows us and wants us to become acquainted with Him. We have tough times ahead. We will need more courage, strength, dedication, and faith. We can do hard things. &nbsp;<br /><br />I leave these things with you, hoping that you have had your hearts touched today, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>

<p>Communication Adjunct Faculty Member</p>
<p>Susan Grant was born in Utah, and was schooled at Utah State and Washington State Universities. She has taught in the Communication Department at BYU-Idaho and Ricks College as an Adjunct Instructor for the better part of 25 years. &nbsp;She always wanted to be a teacher as a child, except when she wanted to be a writer, a nurse, or maybe a mountain goat. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As much as she loves teaching, being a mom tops her list of accomplishments.</p>
<p>She is still trying, after 29 years, to recruit her BYU-Idaho English teacher / potter / poet husband to the fine art of backpacking. &nbsp;She believes there is yet time to save him from the dark side. &nbsp;When she is not mothering her children (and her students), you will find her at her happy place in the Tetons.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>If there is one thing I know, after a lifetime of learning, we need peace.<br /><br /> If I know two things, then I know how to find peace-or at least "become" so it finds you.</p>
<p>It happened for the believers in Mosiah 18, who sought Alma and secretly listened to his teachings near the waters of Mormon.&nbsp; Listen to the miracle of their lives because they believed and sought peace:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that [Alma] said unto them:&nbsp; Behold, here are the waters of Mormon . . . and now, as ye are desirous to <em>come into the fold of God, and to be called his people,</em> and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light. . . .<br /><br /> [I]f this be the desire of your hearts . . . [do ye know] ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his spirit more abundantly upon you?<br /><br /> And now when the people had heard these words, <em>they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed:&nbsp; This is the desire of our hearts. </em>. . .<em> </em><br /><br /> [Y]ea, and they were baptized in the waters of Mormon, and were <em>filled with the grace of God.</em> . . .</p>
<p>Grace equates to divine means of strength or help, remember.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he commanded them that there should be <em>no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love. </em>. . .<br /><br /> And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon, . . . in the forest that was near the waters of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, <em>how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer;</em> yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise forever (Mosiah 18:8, 10-11, 16, 21, 30; emphasis added).</p>
<p>It was<em> </em>there they came to know their Savior, Jesus Christ, <em>and</em> where they chose to become one, "their hearts knit together in unity and love," with a deep and abiding willingness to follow His commandments. And for all this, they were so incredibly grateful<em> </em>"they clapped their hands for <em>joy</em>" (Mosiah 18:11; emphasis added). <br /><br /> They found the Savior.<br /><br /> They loved one another.<br /><br /> They were grateful. <br /><br /> These are so incredibly significant in our search for our own waters of Mormon-our quest for God's grace, His peace.<br /><br />What is a waters of Mormon, you say?&nbsp; How do you find your own?&nbsp; That's what I'd like to share with you today.&nbsp; After half a lifetime of rare but cherished moments in the hills and valleys of our beloved Tetons, I believe I have found some answers.<br /><br /> And guess what: for those of you who are not hikers or bikers or nature lovers, it's not about the summit.&nbsp; It's about believing that God has you.&nbsp; It's having the faith of the prophet Elisha, who, when surrounded by the "many hosts" and chariots of the King of Syria, asked God to show his manservant that God Himself had sent the hosts of heaven and chariots of fire round about to protect them.&nbsp; And Elisha exclaimed, "They that [are] with us are more than they that be with them" (2 Kings 6:16). Tell me in today's world that isn't a visual you want to pack in your back pocket for safe keeping. <br /><br /> <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer</span></em></strong><em> </em><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></em></strong> Part of believing that the Lord is aware of you is learning to recognize what I call the "God loves me" moments in life. It's recognizing that God's grace is real! It's noticing that the chariots of fire are actually there beside you, sometimes in the form of butterflies, or a dear friend in the very moment you need one, or even a parking spot at the new Wal-Mart that isn't in the next county.&nbsp; <br /><br /> May I share a few of my own "God loves mes" with you, that you may come to recognize yours? These are from an opportunity I had to climb the Grand Teton several years ago. Some of them are captured here in photos, my favorite way to record my "God loves mes".<br /><br /> I climbed with a team of six women-strong, confident mountain hearts, half of whom we met only days before the climb.&nbsp; Between us, we had five summits of the Grand under our belts.&nbsp; Three of us had none.&nbsp; You can do the math and realize the blessing it was they were willing to take us "Barbie hikers" along.&nbsp; So you will also understand why this first picture might have brought us some measure of comfort.</p>
<p><img height="125" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture1.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt," by Shakespeare.&nbsp; As we gathered our cumbersome packs and overnight bags at the hotel in Teton Village the night before our climb, we were heartened by this old-timey Shakespearean quote on the wall. It was a "God loves me" moment in pre-climb jitters to stop the fear and uncertainty and <em>be bold</em>.</p>
<p><img height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture2.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>There is a moment on this trail-after the trailhead, after the switchbacks, after two junctions, after the mouth of Garnet Canyon-there is what I call a "door click," where the commotion of the valley floor, even the quiet whispers of the living things of the mountainside, are left behind, like a door closing on the rustling.&nbsp; This is the moment where I recognize I have entered a different world of rock, ice, granite, and diamond dust ground beneath ancient glaciers.&nbsp; This place has boulders bigger than your house, and the silence and the stillness are bigger still.&nbsp; It is tangible. You can feel it.</p>
<p><img height="380" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture3.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>The wildflowers in these high mountain meadows, where summer meets spring, are always a "God loves me" gift; they remind me of my mom and that God's hand is in the details.&nbsp; In my experience the higher in altitude we climb, the more brilliant the colors-until they become rocks, of course.&nbsp; High mountain meadows are breathtaking, as you can see here.</p>
<p><img height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture4.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>Jump with me now up to somewhere around 11-12 thousand feet in the moraine between the Middle Teton and the Grand.&nbsp; Can you see the tiny blue dots mid-center just in front of the rock slide?&nbsp; Like, right next to it?&nbsp; Those are our tents.&nbsp; This shot was taken from far above at the Headwall. It should give you some idea of the immensity of this mountain. I love this reminder of the moraine. It is literally nothing but rocks and snow melt and the occasional skinny hiker. I loved the moraine in twilight, shown here; the peace of it was incredibly profound.&nbsp; It reminded me of D&amp;C 101:16, where it says, "Be still and know that I am God"-one of my absolute favorite scriptures because I recognize that being still and doing nothing are not the same thing, a lesson I learned with absolute certainty in the moraine.</p>
<p><img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:5  camping moraine; tents.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture5.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>Notice our tents here, at the base of that massive rockslide.&nbsp; I wanted you to see a close-up, to recognize the possible peril that lay on every side of us, though I don't think we recognized it as such, as we were yet safe, protected, watched over at every turn. I never dreamed I would love camping in the rocks like I do. I literally . . . love . . . it.&nbsp; I love the silence. Swimming in it somehow made me feel everything more profoundly. Recognizing God's hand in all of it was beyond humbling.</p>
<p><img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:6 glacier waters.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture6.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>The minute we had our tents set up, we went in search of water. It wasn't hard to find.&nbsp; We could hear the constant chatter and dance of the stream coming from beneath the glacier nestled under the summit block of the Middle Teton on the other side of the moraine. We hiked over a rocky stretch (it was all rocky); across a massive berm of rocks, the remnant of an ancient glacier; down through a larger version of rubble to the bottom of the glacier itself. I remember clearly holding my hand in that icy stream as I filtered water for our CamelBaks, our Platypus water carriers, our Nalgene water bottles.&nbsp; Though my fingers were numb, that first swallow was incredible and so icy cold it made my teeth hurt-made me feel oh-so-alive! We were drinking water from a glacier! Put that on your bottled spring water advertising campaign.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong><br /><br /> <img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:7 cracking glacier.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture7.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>Because I was so impressed with having met a glacier up close and personal, I have to mention the glacier cracking in the middle of the night. I would tell you, I wasn't sleeping anyway; no one was. Pre-climb jitters had us all agitated and alert, though we were snuggled in our down bags, awaiting our 3 a.m. start time. <br /><br /> <img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:8 Glacier cracking, take note.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture8.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>I must have been somewhere in la-la land though, for when I heard this immense cracking sound booming across the moraine and bouncing off the rocks and boulders around us, I was instantly wide awake, envisioning the glacier patch below the Middle Teton crashing across the moraine to swallow us whole. I listened for it to roar over the berm of rock that separated us, to sweep us up in a tide of rubble with the tiniest patch of blue nylon tent to show the world what had become of us. It didn't. God loves me. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong><br /><br /> I hope you are starting to see that "God loves mes" are constant reminders that God's love and His hand are ever present in life, that He is aware of you, that He has you, as He had us on that mountain. And sometimes He sends His grace-that divine means of help or strength that literally saves the day or lifts you from the depths of discouragement or fear.&nbsp; We didn't get eaten by a glacier or a bear.&nbsp; They are also ear-markers to remind us to have joy and be grateful: I got to drink glacial melt from my Nalgene. How cool is <em>that</em>?&nbsp; <br /><br /> Now that you're in the swing of things, let's do a few more to make sure you got this.<br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:9 Pika with monkey flowers.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture9.jpg" width="302" /></span></strong></p>
<p>We saw a mountain pika with a mouth full of monkey flowers numerous times in the moraine, where there is really nothing but rocks.&nbsp; They are adorable and precious testaments to the tenacity it takes to live in the high country, and we were doing it. See! God loves me!&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong><br /><br /> <img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:10 duct tape magic.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture10.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>These pink-bedecked bling toes are testament to taping-and really great boots. No blisters! After 5,000 feet of up, no blisters is definitely a "God loves me."<br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:11 Toe Soak in Icy Waters.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture11.jpg" width="302" /></span></strong></p>
<p>Not every "God loves me" moment is picture worthy or epic in nature; sometimes they just happen, and you find yourself swimming in the "Isn't this so amazing?" of it. An icy foot soak after a hot day climbing is just such a moment.&nbsp; If you've never tried it, you'll have to take my word for it; your feet will never feel so alive! And it'll save you from blisters every time.&nbsp; This delicious toe soak came after miles of near-constant climbing. It was worth every agonizing second.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong><br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:12 shadows on valley floor.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture12.jpg" width="302" /></span></strong></p>
<p>That night, before our summit attempt, we relished a carb-loading, energy-packed meal of homemade macaroni and real cheese with sliced fresh tomatoes, both luxuries at nearly 12,000 feet, thanks to the weight-bearing sacrifice of Carrie, one of our team members.&nbsp; We took a moment to sit on a ridge and watch the fading sunlight as it cast the shadows of the Tetons across the valley floor far below us.&nbsp; Isn't it <em>amazing</em>? &nbsp;After the others drifted off to prepare for bed and our 2 a.m. wake-up call, I stayed behind to just drink it in.&nbsp; On every climb and hike I have ever done, there always comes a moment where I recognize this feeling of peace that draws itself around me, and I am always prompted to say, "Dear God, thank you for this moment."&nbsp; This was one of many on this climb.<br /><br /> The supreme silence in the moraine was a "God loves me" that will forever stay with me-a waters of Mormon, if you will. &nbsp;After stepping away from the ridge and gathering my things for the night, I sat outside on a boulder in the dark of night alone for a bit.&nbsp; When you are in the forest, in the trees, if you're me you can hear the whisper of every living thing: trees and brooks and leaves and squirrels and boogiemen and bears and wolves and things that go bump in the night.&nbsp; At altitude in the moraine, there was not even a whisper of wind.&nbsp; The silence was so complete my awareness of the calm brought profound peace to my heart as I recognized how safe I felt in the stillness of this massive rocky cirque.&nbsp; I have never known that kind of quiet; it was my idea of heavenly, though it was full-on black dark.&nbsp; Anxious to just be climbing and getting this thing done, I relished the peace that settled about me in those moments because I took the time to find it.&nbsp; <br /><br /> This is significant, by the way. "God loves mes" don't usually jump up and bite you, though they are everywhere for the discovering.&nbsp; You have to stop and notice them. They work best if you really relish and savor them as well, like sitting on a rock in the middle of a much, much bigger rock and allowing the moon to crawl across the sky and cast its ethereal beams across your heart.&nbsp; There's nothing like it.&nbsp; I realize it feels much safer, much more secure, to be nestled in the tent, in your sleeping bag, in your warm, dry wool socks, tucked in next to your hiking buddies, but . . . the moon can't get at you there. &nbsp;<br /><br /> Sometimes, in my experience,&nbsp; you have to take the advice of the rookie zookeeper in that movie <em>We Bought a Zoo</em>, who, when advising his son about talking to a girl or nursing a sick lion or buying a zoo, said, "Sometimes you just need 10 seconds of insane courage" and the job is done.&nbsp; Sometimes in life, you just have to be bold. &nbsp;Some "God loves mes" are like that.&nbsp; Here's one.<br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:13  Boot views from the belly crawl.jpg" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture13.jpg" width="385" /></span></strong></p>
<p>Early on in our second day, on what I considered to be one of the most perilous features on the Owen-Spalding route on the summit block, I waited around a bend in the rock for my turn to rope up.&nbsp; While we shivered in the pre-dawn shadows of the Grand, I heard one of my life's dearest friends call out, "My boot's stuck.&nbsp; No, really, I can't get it out."&nbsp; She was climbing ahead of me, and she was in trouble.&nbsp; If you picture a cabbage head, with the leaves peeling back just so, this rock was like that: a thin leaf of rock peeled away from the mountain herself, and you could either shimmy over the top of it straddle-style, or you could tip-toe on a tiny ledge with your boots and leave the imprints of your fingerprints on the cabbage leaf as you edged your way around it, hence the "belly roll" name.&nbsp; Michelle and I had predetermined we would shimmy.&nbsp; And now her boot was stuck. &nbsp;&nbsp;And it wouldn't come out. This maybe wasn't such a big deal if you looked to the right of her, the summit block rising straight out of sight in a wall of granite and cracks.&nbsp; At least it was solid ground.&nbsp; On the other side of her, however, the mountain fell away to Valhalla and what would become Cascade Canyon 2,000 feet below.&nbsp; Yes, really.&nbsp; This was not good.&nbsp; Even though I knew she was roped in, I could taste the fear for her safety in my throat as she worked to free her boot.&nbsp; Most of us were unable to see her, let alone reach her or be of any help.&nbsp; The "God loves me" in this moment is that after some perilous doing, Michelle did not fall from the belly roll; she was miraculously able to take off her boot, dislodge it, and shimmy to safety. &nbsp;And we all breathed again. &nbsp;Ten seconds of insane courage.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong><br /><br /> <img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:14 long rapelle.JPG" height="385" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture14.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>One of the most surprising blessings on this climb came after we had reached the summit and started down-climbing, which is trickier and scarier than going up, believe it or not. When we reached the 110' long rappel down a long, open, exposed chimney, we all stopped to tighten harnesses and regroup before this, the longest and most dangerous of three rappels off the summit block. If you're not familiar with rappelling, it's essentially tying yourself into a rope swing and backing yourself off and away from the side of the mountain into open air with what feels like a piece of dental floss tied to your waist. It's a supreme act of faith in "trust the rope"-and your team.<br /><br /> <img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:15 Long rapelle Michelle.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture15.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>If you've ever hiked with me, you know I'm a shutterbug and a dawdler.&nbsp; I <em>love</em> the back of the line, where I can just doodle around and take pictures and catch up as I want.&nbsp; Well, that morning in the predawn, I could <em>not</em> find my camera, even though I knew I had packed it with my gear the night before.&nbsp; I even took an extra precious two minutes looking for it while the team waited before we set out.&nbsp; I was supremely disappointed it was missing.&nbsp; I <em>always</em> take pictures, and this was the climb of my life, and I was going to miss it.&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong><br /><br /> Well,&nbsp; in that moment coming down the summit block, as I waited for my friends ahead of me to tie up for the rappel, &nbsp;I found my camera!&nbsp; Right here in my hip pocket, where I always carry it.&nbsp; Where it had to have been bumping and smacking against me all day?&nbsp; But it wasn't?&nbsp; &nbsp;I was able to catch these epic first shots of the day.&nbsp; I can't tell you how delighted I was to have it in my hands.&nbsp; And humbled.&nbsp; I recognized the miracle it was that my focus-and theirs-had been on our team and keeping us safe and focused all the way up this mountain.<br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:16 Long Rapelle Tammi.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture16.jpg" width="302" /></span></strong></p>
<p>It was only now that the Lord figured I had the presence of mind to both down-climb <em>and</em> take these epic pictures of my friends doing the impossible, and stay safe.&nbsp; What I said out loud was a delighted "Hey! God loves me! Look what I found!" &nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet by myself, as the others tied in, what I said in my heart was, "Wow.&nbsp; You did this.&nbsp; Dear God, thank you for this moment."<br /><br /> <img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:17 Eastern face of Table Rock w evening sun.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture17.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>At one point, as we approached the Lower Saddle (that slope you can see between the Middle Teton and the Grand from Rexburg), we stopped to put moleskin on a blister on one of our teammates who had new boots (and had obviously not heard of the magic combination of pink toenails and duct tape).&nbsp; We had been in the nearly perpetual cycle of climb, wait, climb since 3 a.m., and the sun now told us we were approaching evening when we noticed the shadows on the eastern side of Table Rock.&nbsp; We'd all seen her from the west multiple times; but this view was fresh and new and spectacular in the lowering sun-definitely a peaceful "God loves me" moment I would long treasure.&nbsp; Again, the stillness of being in the rocks washed over me.&nbsp; Though the long-range views and skies were hazy from multiple western wildfires, the vision of this familiar and beloved mountain awash in evening sun was truly...wow.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong><br /><br /> <img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:18 Twilight Moraine.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture18.jpg" width="302" /></p>
<p>Later, after scaling the headwall in the twilight of evening, as we approached our little blue-dot tents in the moraine, I felt I was standing on holy ground in that sea of rocks and stillness. We had done it; we had summited the Grand.&nbsp; And we were safe. And alive. And we had become one in the doing of it. &nbsp;It felt...epic. Sacred.&nbsp; As a team, we were quietly jubilant, reverent.&nbsp; The twilight of the moraine, awash in the alpenglow of a setting sun, was the perfect setting for the way we felt.&nbsp; Waters of Mormon.&nbsp; We had felt the Savior near.&nbsp; We had watched out and cared for one another, experiencing the true love of Christ.&nbsp; And we were oh so grateful.<br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:19 Saying goodbye to the moraine.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture19.jpg" width="302" /></span></strong></p>
<p>This is a shot of the moraine and the Jackson Hole valley below in the next-day morning sun.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hated the leaving; it made me feel, if you can imagine, bereft of the mountain.&nbsp; It was there, in that rocky moraine, I felt the Spirit most keenly. In the night with the moon, in the twilight with my climbing team, at the foot of a glacier, and now awash in morning rays of sun, the Spirit of the place never changed with the light, as most places do.&nbsp; I still don't understand why.&nbsp; I just know what I felt there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't want to leave it; I miss it still.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong><br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img alt="Devotional-graphics:Education Week:Susan Grant:pictures:20 Disappointment Peak AND the Grand.JPG" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/education-week/2016/Devotional Graphics 2016/Picture20.jpg" width="302" /></span></strong></p>
<p>We found ourselves nearing the trailhead, trying not to be too all-knowing in our 40-pound packs, climbing gear, and Mountain Hardwear demeanor when tourists in their flip-flops, with their fancy camera lenses strapped across their chests like medals, packing umbrellas for shade, would stop us and ask, "Are there really bears here?" After being in the high country in the stillness and the silence, after feeling the mountain breathe, after all of it, my brain did not want to engage with the onslaught of humanity.&nbsp; I found myself surprisingly near tears when we caught this last rare shot of Disappointment Peak outlined in a snowfield against the Grand. I thought it a very cool "God loves me" in the final steps of this climb that He would remind me of the humbling blessing of having stood atop both.<br /><br /> Brothers and sisters, the "God loves mes" of our everydays are not always obviously miraculous, but sometimes they are.&nbsp; And sometimes they don't need to be; sometimes just seeing the simplicity of a mountain bluebell along a mountain path is enough.&nbsp; It's in the recognizing God's hand that your own waters of Mormon begins to happen!<br /><br /> <strong>The next bit is the secret to all of it, the sacred element that lends itself to God's grace, His divine help and strength, and therefore His peace.&nbsp; <em>You have to be grateful and sometimes clap your hands with joy.</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong> You will have noticed by now my habit of uttering "Dear God, thank you for this moment" so often it might be monotonous to hear it again.&nbsp; For me, finding the "waters of Mormon" as described in Mosiah chapter 18 is not a one-time gig-it is a constant desire to feel the Savior near, to feel His love close, a cheerful willingness to share it with others and always to feel grateful.<br /><br /> You may have already noted we had dozens of opportunities for gratitude on this epic, once-in-a-lifetime climb.&nbsp; I can't imagine ever replicating the joy we experienced in the very doing of it.&nbsp; I recognize the rare, miraculous blessing of being a Latter-day Saint believer who has had the opportunity to walk on mountaintops.&nbsp; I testify to you that gratitude for the blessings and the challenges are part of the package in finding your waters of Mormon. <br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"They clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed, This is the desire of our hearts" (Mosiah 18:11)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong>If I had a picture of this sacred moment to share with you, it would be of my tired cheek nestled on sun-warmed granite, eyes closed to the sun.&nbsp; We had summited somewhere around 2 p.m.&nbsp; And now we were nearly down off the summit block. We had one more chimney to rappel. It was full of junk rock, which, after looking at it in our jubilant but exhausted state, made it much, much easier to consider strapping up to that bit of dental floss of a rope and stepping off the edge rather than down-climbing it.&nbsp; As I again waited my turn, I had opportunity to lay my head against a slab of sun-warmed granite, one leg thrown over the edge of the massive boulder we were huddled on, oblivious to the drop below, and close my eyes to the sun. I rested there, listening to the quiet talk of these brave souls, my friends, these women who had become a team in the course of climbing this mountain.&nbsp; I was in awe of them: their courage, their strength, and ability to step up when needed.&nbsp; Their constant encouragement "We got this" had echoed quietly across the mountain all day.&nbsp; We had climbed as one, with dignity and grace, with respect and love for the mountain herself, which had been needful to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I rested my cheek on that granite block and felt the warm seep into my soul, I felt a deep and abiding peace settle over me, which I may attribute, at least in part, to exhaustion. But oh! how I love the feel of a sun-warmed rock on my face and in the palm of my hands.&nbsp; In that moment I felt connected to the mountain and the Spirit there in a way I've only heard described clearly once, by Elder Melvin J. Ballard (Crusader for Righteousness; 1966; pp. 138-9).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Away on the Fort Peck Reservation where I was doing missionary work..., I found myself one evening in the dreams of the night in that sacred building, the temple.&nbsp; After a season of prayer and rejoicing I was informed that I should have the privilege of entering into one of those rooms to meet a glorious Personage, and, as I entered the door, I saw, seated on a raised platform, the most glorious Being my eyes have ever beheld or that I ever conceived existed in all the eternal worlds.&nbsp; As I approached to be introduced, he arose and stepped toward me with extended arms, and he smiled as he softly spoke my name.&nbsp; If I shall live to be a million years old, I shall never forget that smile.&nbsp; He took me into his arms and kissed me, pressed me to his bosom, and blessed me, until the marrow of my bones seemed to melt!&nbsp; When he had finished, I fell at his feet, and, as I bathed them with my tears and kisses, I saw the prints of the nails in the feet of the Redeemer of the world.&nbsp; The feeling that I had in the presence of Him who hath all things in His hands, to have His love, His affection, and His blessing was such that if I ever can receive that of which I had but a foretaste, I would give all that I am, all that I ever hope to be to feel what I then felt!</p>
<p>Even in the joy of our success and safety after our climb, our evening meal of a menagerie of trail food from all our packs had been quiet.&nbsp; The salty taste of tuna salad on crackers was mana. As we ate and sat in silence, we could all feel the reverence we shared for this mighty, magnificent mountain who had been so very good to us that day in our 18 hours of climbing.&nbsp; Later that night, as I lay again not sleeping in my down bag, I watched the moon make her way over the nylon of our tent.&nbsp; And I listened to the quiet breathing of my team, these women who had helped me stay safe and warm and present on the mountain-these wonderful, dear, lifelong friends next to me.&nbsp; And I felt more than heard the mountain breathing as well; she felt close.&nbsp; I can only describe the experience as being held in the palm of God's hand as I again felt the quiet and the stillness draw me in.&nbsp; It lasted only moments, but that ethereal quiet will forever walk with me.&nbsp; I know what it is to be still and know that there is a God.</p>
<p><br /> So . . . what is a "waters of Mormon" exactly?&nbsp; How do you find your own?&nbsp;<br /><br /> It's knowing that "God hath not given us the spirit of fear," as he says in 2 Timothy 1:7, "but of <em>power</em>, and of <em>love</em>" (emphasis added).&nbsp; <br /><br /> It is determining that in this world of angst and worry, there is something far more important than fear.&nbsp; For me (and I believe for you) that something is our Savior, Jesus Christ, and His love and peace. Because I learned to recognize His peace in the mountains I know and love, I now find it everywhere.<br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Beautiful Upon the Mountains</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong> I have felt it<br /> Recently.<br /> Several times.<br /> The Stillness.<br /> Upper mountain meadows<br /> And moraine,<br /> Reaching out<br /> With arms of quiet,<br /> Solitude,<br /> To cradle me in gentle hands<br /> Of Peace.<br /> Supernal Joy.<br /> The Silence profound.<br /><br />Even the rustle<br /> Of&nbsp;falling leaves,<br /> Critters aflutter,<br /> And boot scuffs on piney trails<br /> Remain in forest eves.<br /> Here,<br /> In this mountain heaven,<br /> Where living things reside<br /> 'Neath boulders<br /> And rocky slides,<br /> The Silence runs deep.<br /> Inside.<br /><br />And even as I tread<br /> ---my feet light,<br /> My heart says,<br /> Like Moses,<br /> Turn aside!<br /> That thou may seest<br /> This great sight.<sup>1</sup><br /> So I move to the light,<br /> And close my eyes.<br /> Cast my arms wide<br /> ---today's color is white!<br /> Ethereal,<br /> Spiritual,<br /> Balm.<br /> Photosynthesis!<br /> Being fed,<br /> At heaven's height.<br /><br />I am want to put off my boots<br /> And kneel in iridescent sands,<br /> For this place<br /> Whereon I stand<br /> Feels like Holy ground.<sup>2</sup><br /> Yes, standing in His Grace.<br /> I cast my eyes<br /> Round about<br /> At boulders,<br /> Rocks, and sky.<br /> And I feel carried,<br /> Even as on eagles' wing<sup>3</sup><br /> To summits beyond,<br /> Even I.<br /><br />"Be still, Little One, and know that I am God.<sup>4</sup><br /> Fear not, for in me your joy is full;<sup>5</sup><br /> And they that be with us,<br /> Are more than they that be with them.<sup>6</sup><br /> I whisper Peace, unto thy soul.<br /> Thine afflictions shall be<br /> But a small moment.<sup>7</sup><br /> Trust in the Lord<br /> With all thine heart<br /> And lean not<br /> Unto thine own understanding.<sup>8</sup><br /> As I was with Moses,<br /> So shall I be with thee;<br /> I will not fail thee<br /> Nor forsake thee.<sup>9</sup><br /> Be strong and of a good courage;<br /> Be not afraid...<br /> For the Lord thy God<br /> Is with thee.<sup>10</sup><br /> And whoso shall publish peace,<br /> Yea, tidings of great joy,<br /> How beautiful upon the mountains<br /> Shall they be.<sup>11</sup><br /> Lift up your heart My child; and Be Glad; and look."<sup>12</sup><br /><br />And I do.<br />And I am.<br /> Here,<br /> In the heart of this mountain,<br /> Held,<br /> In His hands.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.A. Grant</p>
<p>I testify to you that these waters of Mormon don't exist just on mountaintops and passes; they are everywhere among us. Watch for them. Stop and breathe and relish them. Be grateful. And you will know that He <em>is</em> God and He does indeed love you. In a world gone crazy, there is no greater peace than that. I leave you this witness in the name of Jesus Christ-our Savior, our Redeemer, our confidante, our brother, and friend-amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I am very grateful for my friends and family and all the prayers offered on my behalf as I prepared for this address. When I received a call in May to be the devotional speaker, my first thought was, what could I possibly share? My second thought was, well, at least it's the summer term and fewer people will be listening. However, after I was able to get over the initial shock, my feelings turned to gratitude to be able to share this message at a place where I have been given so much and my life has truly been changed for good. And I will really be grateful in about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I want a little audience participation today, so I'm going to ask a few questions. Raise your hand if when you were younger you knew exactly what you wanted to be when you were older? I did too. I wanted to be a singer&mdash;and not just any singer but to sing on stage. You see, I have an older sister that was and still is an amazing singer, and I wanted to be like her. But, as you may have guessed, my plan did not work out. I am not a singer.</p>
<p>So, obviously, my plan changed, and I went on to plan B. Once the singer phase passed, I wanted to be a writer because I love to read. I was even grounded for reading. I wrote one good play in second grade that a few of my fellow students performed, but it was downhill after that, so I'm not a writer either. In fact, my life plan has changed so many times I've lost count.</p>
<p>Now let's be really honest. How many of you are on a different plan than you wanted or expected? Maybe it wasn't your choice. Maybe you didn't get into another university and BYU-Idaho was the only option. Maybe you don't know what you want to study and you feel stuck, hoping that something will inspire you. Maybe you had a plan, but it's not what you thought it would be, and now you don't know what to do. Maybe you're just drifting, hoping that once the current crisis is over, you'll know where to focus your energies. Maybe you've been in the same job so long you are in a rut or you don't feel challenged.</p>
<p>So why are life plan changes so hard for us to accept? Sometimes our plans change simply because we change our minds. Sometimes our plans are changed for us. Sometimes when we are feeling stuck, no matter how hard we work, it seems nothing works out and we have no idea what to do next. Sometimes our life plans change so drastically we aren't sure how to keep moving forward and how to cope with the changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Paul V. Johnson said, "At times it may seem that our trials"&mdash;or changes to our life plan, as I like to call them&mdash;"are focused on areas of our lives and parts of our souls with which we seem least able to cope. Since personal growth is an intended outcome of these challenges, it should come as no surprise that the trials can be very personal&mdash;almost laser guided to our particular needs or weaknesses."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>My parents were converts, and in fact it was my father who allowed the missionaries into our home. My mother was so opposed to their visits that she constantly offered them cigarettes, coffee, tea, and other non-Word of Wisdom-approved beverages. I'm not sure why they came back, but I am grateful that they did. Eventually, they taught the lesson on eternal families, and my parents were baptized. My mother gave up all her Word of Wisdom issues cold turkey and never looked back. They were sealed in the temple when my mother was pregnant with me. She had basically been an only child and wanted a large, loving family. Well, she got the large part, and most of the time we were loving to each other. Many years later, my father left her with eight children when my youngest sibling was five. I will never forget how devastated my mother was those first few days. Her life plan&mdash;which she wanted so badly&mdash;had been so drastically changed. My siblings and I all dealt with this change in different ways. I stayed by my mother's side and even slept on the floor beside her many nights. One brother told me he felt he wasn't normal anymore because we didn't have a "perfect" family. Another brother felt relief as he had always had a strained relationship with my father. And I could go on, but in some way or another, we all felt frozen or broken and didn't know how to really move forward.</p>
<p>It was the first experience I had of having a life plan change that was difficult for not only me but my entire family and a life change that had eternal consequences. While it was devastating and took time for us all to adjust to the "new plan," eventually I saw the quiet strength and determination my mother had to move forward with a life plan she did not want nor expect. I saw her keep her head up high and continue to teach her children the gospel. I saw the Lord put many people in our lives to compensate for the change. I saw my brothers take the priesthood lead in our home. And I saw my brothers and sisters care for my mother with great love and respect. <br /><br /> Even with that example from my youth and knowing that life could be hard, changes to my life plan continued to be interesting. I always wanted to be a stay-at-home mother, but that was not an option for me. During the early years of my temple marriage, I never dreamed it would end in divorce, but it did. Sometimes changes were easy to accept. Other times I have had to pray for help with specific, hard changes and that I would be courageous enough to accept and handle them when and if they did happen. Changes to my plan were the most difficult to handle when I didn't seem to have a purpose, and all I could do was follow the example of my mother, which was to just keep moving forward, focus on my blessings, and trust the Lord knew what He was doing. <br /><br />Five years ago, I took a huge leap of faith, and I trusted in the Lord when I accepted a position in the Student Financial Aid Office here on campus. I relocated from Arkansas&mdash;where I had lived for 16 years, where my four children were raised, and where my mother and two siblings resided. I knew it was the right move, because the Lord had confirmed it to me many times before, during and after the move. But even with that confirmation, my attention was often focused on how hard life was during that time and how hard it was to move forward. Sister Janet G. Lee said in a BYU devotional address, "How many times are we, as Heavenly Father's children, immobilized because the choice we had in mind for ourselves just isn't available to us, at least not at the time we want it?"&nbsp; She went on to say, "It is so easy to...do nothing when things wished for and dreamed about are beyond our reach."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time and other times in my life, I have been immobilized. I believe it was because I didn't feel like <em>I</em> had a plan for my life. I knew the Lord had a plan, but I wasn't sure it was the plan <em>I</em> wanted. I wanted to pick my own plan, not rely on the Lord's plan, and I wanted my plan to happen right now. Isn't that funny? I thought I could just put the Lord out of the equation even though I depended on Him so much. I also knew the Lord loved His children and blessed them in their struggles, but sometimes I wasn't sure how that applied to me. I allowed Satan to discourage and disable me. <br /><br /> Recently, I went to Yellowstone with some of my family. I saw this view and had to take a picture.</p>
<p>This is often how I have felt during struggles in my life. I felt that the Lord had forgotten about me and stuck me in a deserted spot. All I could see was that I was in this all by myself.</p>
<p>A year or so after I relocated to Rexburg, I was reading in the Lorenzo Snow manual for a Relief Society lesson, and I came across this quote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is impossible for us to work out our salvation and accomplish the purposes of God without trials or without sacrifices.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Trials and tribulations have been the experience of the Latter-day Saints. God so designed that it should be. I daresay that in the [premortal] spirit world, when it was proposed to us to come into this probation, and pass through the experience that we are now receiving, it was not altogether pleasant and agreeable; the prospects were not so delightful in all respects as might have been desired. Yet there is no doubt that we saw and understood clearly there that, in order to accomplish our exaltation and glory, this was a necessary experience; and however disagreeable it might have appeared to us, we were willing to conform to the will of God, and consequently we are here.<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn3" title="">[3]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn3" title=""></a>While I know this life will be hard, when I was younger I always focused on how wonderful it must have been to be there and choose our Father's plan. I grew up thinking I was there in the premortal life, together with my siblings, parents, and future family, and we all cheered together that this was a wonderful chance and we could do it. I imagined us all jumping for joy at the thought of mortality. But as I matured and lived these difficulties and felt the exquisite pain and suffering of this mortal body, I couldn't imagine I wanted all this heartache and pain, all these trials, all these life plan changes. So this quote from President Snow finally made sense. We knew how difficult this life would be. It was not just a clich&eacute; on a poster. We knew before that this life would be so very hard. We knew before that we would be hurt by others&mdash;sometimes by those we love the most. We knew that we would feel pain and disappointment and grief. We knew it, and yet we still chose to experience mortality. We chose to come to earth and follow our Father's plan because we trusted Him. We trusted Him then, and we must trust Him now. So whatever I was dealing with in my life, I knew it was going to be okay. I knew the Lord was in charge and things would happen in His time. Not my plan, and not my timing, but the Lord's plan and the Lord's timing. The Lord was not going to let me fail. He was going to take everything in my life, good and bad, and use it for good if I would let Him. D&amp;C 90:24&nbsp;says it better: "Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one with another."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn4" title="">[4]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn4" title=""></a>Even though I knew in my heart things would be okay, my mind wasn't always content with that answer. So I turned to examples in the scriptures to help me. Sometimes I connected with very positive examples that buoyed me up. Other times I connected more with the not-so-great examples. One instance is Lehi's family. Their entire family's life plan changed, and while Nephi embraced the change, Laman and Lemuel did not. Nephi didn't just follow blindly but often went to the Lord to understand in order to be able to accept the changes and know his part. However, Laman and Lemuel did not accept the change well. They murmured and complained and basically whined because their plan changed without their permission. They too were immobilized and couldn't move forward. This inability to accept their life plan change eventually broke their family apart, and for generations their posterity blamed others for what they felt they had lost&mdash;all because of a change in plans. While I would like to say I was always like Nephi, there are times I connected, and still connect, more with Laman and Lemuel. <br /><br />Another example is that of the people of Ammon. When they were presented with the gospel and a new plan for their lives, they accepted it wholeheartedly, and those that were converted never fell away. Not one of them was upset that their previous life plan changed, because what they gained was better. They now understood the plan of salvation, the great plan of happiness as Alma called it. They embraced the gospel and its teachings to the point that they, as Alma 23:13 says, "laid down the weapons of their rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> They put aside the only life they had ever known. They were not like the Nephites. They were warriors and scavengers; they were not farmers and peacemakers. They changed their entire way of life. Alma 23:18 says, "And they began to be a very industrious people."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> They even changed their name to the Anti-Nephi-Lehies to reflect their new life.</p>
<p>But what happens next is amazing to me. After they had put away their weapons of war and changed their way of life, many of the unconverted Lamanites were angry and took up arms in war against the people of Ammon. Because they so totally embraced the gospel&mdash;embraced their new life plan&mdash;the Anti-Nephi-Lehies took their weapons of war that they had put away and buried them. They buried them even though they knew the Lamanites were coming to kill them. They buried their weapons so they would not be tempted to go back to their old life. They buried them as a sign they wanted to move forward, not only for themselves but for their future generations. They knew that their life plan change was not only for them but for their posterity, and who were those future generations but the stripling warriors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know what happens next. The Lamanites came and the Anti-Nephi-Lehies went out to meet them. They didn't cower in their homes, they didn't say "why me," they didn't murmur or complain, they didn't look in the rearview mirror. I can't imagine this is the life plan they thought they would be getting when they accepted the gospel, but they embraced their new life plan because they trusted the Lord. They trusted him literally with their lives and the lives of their families. Many perished while praising God. They showed by their actions their testimony was more important than anything else.</p>
<p>I don't know, but I would assume there were people on both sides that knew each other and loved each other. Friend versus friend. And because of the example of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies, more Lamanites joined the people of God that day than were slain. The Lord took this terrible situation and turned it for good not only at that particular time but also many years later, when over two thousand young men chose Helaman, the prophet of the Lord, to be their leader and chose to defend their families so their parents didn't have to break their covenants with the Lord&mdash;the two thousand young men who had not been trained in warfare or how to handle a sword but were propelled by their faith. Alma 56:47: "Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them".<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn7" title="">[7]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn7" title=""></a>I can't speak for any of you, but I have never been asked to give up my life for the gospel or my beliefs. I doubt that will ever happen to me. But the Lord does expect me to take the life I have been dealt and to do the best I can with it. All of us have had trials or changes in our lives, and many of us may be living with difficult situations right now. If you are struggling, consider counseling or medical help if necessary. But know that no matter what you are going through, the Lord is there. The Lord loves us because we are His, and He will always love us no matter what we have done or what we haven't done. He hears you and is there to comfort you if you will let Him. He is there to heal you if you want to be healed. He can make you whole. If you need to make changes in your life plan, make them. If you are waiting on the Lord to fix things, He will; just keep waiting, and continue to do your part. If your life plan has changed without your permission, embrace it, because the Lord will take everything in your life and turn it for your good, and He will send angels to your rescue. D&amp;C 84:88 states, "And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a><sup> </sup>I will admit, I have felt those angels many times. While I am always grateful for them, sometimes those angels seem to accompany me for a very long time, which I have learned means I must be patient and wait on the Lord's timing. I don't know how you feel, but for me, sometimes waiting is hard. <br /><br />During that particular period of difficulty in my life that I have mentioned before, a friend gave me a talk by Brother Dale Sturm that became my daily mantra. He said, "So to those engaged right now in the hard work of waiting I would suggest...have faith. Have faith that God knows what He is doing. What God is doing in you while you wait may be more important than what you are waiting for." I want to repeat that. "What God is doing in you while you wait may be more important than what you are waiting for." Brother Sturm went on to say, "Sometimes the outcomes we think we are waiting for are not at all what God has in store for us."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn9" title="">[9]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn9" title=""></a>So we have to wait on the Lord and trust that He is working out our past for a better future. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said, "There are times when we have to step into the darkness in faith, confident that God will place solid ground beneath our feet once we do."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> So how do we do that? How do we have faith and trust, and step into the darkness when our world seems to be crumbling around us? <br /><br />One of my favorite scriptures is Malachi 3:10: "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house; and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a><sup> </sup>While this scripture is specifically about tithing, I interpret it as this: give all you have to the Lord; be humble and teachable and accepting of His will. <br /><br />Quite a few years ago, I took this scripture to heart; I wanted to prove that the Lord would bless me abundantly if I gave my all to "His storehouse"&mdash;not just my tithing but my time, my obedience, my all. Then something happened where I really had to make a choice. I was in a demanding calling at the time, working full time, with four children and all the activities that involved.</p>
<p>One particular Sunday, when I was feeling overwhelmed, the sisters of the ward (not the youth) were encouraged to read the Book of Mormon in 30 days and promised if we did, the Lord would pour out blessings upon us. Well, I was upset. They went on to say it should only take 45 minutes to an hour a day. Well, then I nearly went ballistic. I remember all the way home thinking, "How can they ask this of me? Don't they know what I have on my plate?" I stewed for quite some time, and as I knelt in prayer that night, I remember asking the Lord for help and listing all the "blessings" I believed my family needed. Well, you could say I felt like I had been hit with a ton of bricks. The Lord was giving me an opportunity where we had been promised an outpouring of blessings, but all I saw was another change to my life plan that I didn't want. So I decided to put it to the test, prove whether the Lord would really pour out blessings on me. Now, I know I wanted material blessings, financial blessings, but I forged ahead. The first few days were hard trying to find time to read, but after a few days a routine emerged, and sometimes one or more of my children would come and listen until I had finished, and then we would talk about their day. It was also amazing what I learned. It was the first time I had read the Book of Mormon that quickly, and it really came alive. Now, I did not receive any personal financial blessings&mdash;quite the opposite&mdash;but later, when President Gordon B. Hinckley asked us to read the Book of Mormon as a family by the end of the year, there was really no hesitation from my children, except some days when we were behind and had to read three pages instead of one and a half. President Hinckley offered this promise: "Without reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe this simple program, regardless of how many times you previously may have read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn12" title="">[12]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn12" title=""></a>Now, I can't say we always had an added measure of the Spirit in our home, but it strengthened my testimony and understanding that the Lord's plan is always better than our own plan. Don't ask the Lord to <em>change</em> his plan for you, but be willing to <em>accept </em>His plan for you. Put all your biases aside, as hard as that is, and accept His will. He has proven to me over and over again that He loves me and that He has a plan for my life that is so much better than what I had planned for myself. He loves me even though I don't always deserve it. And I testify to you that He loves you and has a plan for you too.</p>
<p>Lyrics from a song by Hilary Weeks say it better than I can:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you'll take this heart willful as it seems...<br />And through your mercy, refine me until I'm complete...<br />Until my will turns to you<br />Until I trust<br />Without hesitation<br />When humility has chased away the pride<br />Until the day and through your grace I'm<br />welcomed home<br />Until then<br />Prove me <br />(Weeks, 2007)<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""></a>President Lorenzo Snow said, "The Lord has determined in His heart that He will try us until He knows what He can do with us... If we succeed in passing through the approaching fiery ordeals with our fidelity and integrity unimpeached, we may expect at the close of our trials, a great and mighty outpouring of the Spirit and power of God&mdash;a great endowment upon all who shall have remained true to their covenants."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn14" title="">[14]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn14" title=""></a>Remember this dreary place where I felt I was left all alone?</p>
<p>When I was able to bring myself from only looking inward or looking down in despair, I was able to see the Lord had put me in a place where I was protected and loved. While I wanted to be a stay-at-home mother, having work experience and skills prepared me for this job. While being single is different, the Lord has still allowed me to serve in many ways and empathize with others. He has not taken all of the baggage from my life away, but He has made it lighter and given me so many wonderful opportunities I had once only dreamed about, opportunities like having a temple within walking distance, having my four children live close to me, being able to spend time with my grandchildren, having a brother and his family&mdash;and soon my mother&mdash;living in Rexburg, and my new extended family and friends. As a result of being on this campus, and thanks to the wonderful faculty, I was able to accomplish a lifelong dream and finish my undergraduate degree in accounting this past April. I have been further blessed with the opportunity to continue forward with my education. The Lord has not left me alone, but He has given me all that I need and so much of what I truly want. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, "We may at times assume that the plan of salvation requires merely that we endure and survive when, in fact, as is always the case with the gospel of Jesus Christ, it is required of us not only that we endure, but also that we endure well, that we exhibit 'grace under pressure.' This is necessary, not only so that our own passage through the trial can be a growth experience, but also because (more than we know) there are always people watching to see if we can cope, who therefore may resolve to venture forth and to cope themselves."<a href="/devotionals/robin-dunlop#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> There have been and continue to be so many people in my life that help me endure, because as I watch them, they continue to endure gracefully. <br /><br /> Brothers and sisters, I am not special, and my challenges are small compared to some, but I know that the Lord takes those challenges, whether they are of our own making or not, and uses them for our benefit if we let Him. I bear you my testimony that we get everything we need from the Lord when we <em>need</em> it most, not necessarily when we <em>want</em> it most. I testify that when we put our biases aside and trust in the Lord's plan for us, He can work miracles in our lives and change us not only for our good but for the good of those around us. <br /><br /> I encourage you to look back at the blessings the Lord has given you, the challenges He has helped you overcome, and prepare yourself to be flexible as you plan your life so you can be guided by our Father in Heaven. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p>Humanities and Philosophy Faculty Member</p>
<p>Vaughn Stephenson was born in Rupert, Idaho and raised in Acequia, Idaho. He is the third of four children born to Eldon and Erlene Stephenson.</p>
<p>Brother Stephenson attended Ricks College prior to serving in the France Paris Mission. After returning from his mission he attended BYU where he met his wife, Elizabeth Clark, and earned a bachelor's degree in Communication Education with a minor in French. He also earned a master's degree from BYU in Communication and was named the Outstanding Graduate. He later earned a PhD in Adult Education from the University of Idaho.</p>
<p>Prior to coming to teach at BYU-Idaho, Brother Stephenson taught speech, drama and choir at his former high school until 1989, when he was hired as a member of the humanities faculty.<br /><br /> Brother Stephenson has served in the church in a variety of capacities including ward choir director, gospel doctrine teacher, primary teacher, stake high council, and in two YSA wards. He currently serves in his ward Sunday School and as an ordinance worker in the Rexburg Temple.<br /><br /> Vaughn Stephenson and his wife, Elizabeth, are the parents of three daughters and one son, and the grandparents of two and three quarter grandchildren.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the very vivid memories I have of Primary (actually, when I was growing up it was junior Sunday School; Primary was held during the week and Junior Sunday School on the Sabbath)-and this is a frequent memory-is of our teachers and leaders telling us to be reverent. I can still hear Sister Maughan say, "Boys and girls, we need to be reverent. Fold your arms in class." I can still see very clearly in my mind the image of dozens of struggling 6-to-10-year-olds with their arms tightly knotted, like this.&nbsp; We figured we were being reverent because that's what they told us we needed to do, was to be quiet and fold our arms. We would sing a song. "Reverently, quietly, lovingly we think of thee." I came to understand that reverence was a synonym of silence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Years later-I think when I was attending Ricks College, located near here-I heard this definition of reverence from President David O. McKay, the President of the Church while I was in Primary: "Reverence is profound respect mingled with love." That somehow seems to be a very different thing than tightly folded arms and pursed lips. As the current Primary song says, "Reverence is more than just quietly sitting." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I am going to speak about what reverence is, what it is not, and then I will focus mostly on one often-overlooked element of reverence and how this can greatly enrich all aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>If reverence is a feeling of respect, then quiet might not be an obvious sign of reverence. For example, you can very quietly play games, text, surf the web, and even find Pok&eacute;mon during a class at school, a devotional, or even during a sacrament meeting.&nbsp; In all of these instances you would be very quiet but also extraordinarily disrespectful. Obviously, quiet does not equal reverence. I came to understand this even more fully as I have participated at various times in my life in temple dedications. At the conclusion of the dedicatory prayer, the prophet leads the congregation in the Hosanna Shout-not the hosanna whisper.</p>
<p>We read this in 1 Nephi 11:1-6:</p>
<p>As I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw. And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father. And when I had spoken these words, the <em>Spirit cried with a loud voice, saying</em>: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for he is God over all the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the most high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired. (Emphasis added)</p>
<p>I'm certain nobody is more reverent than the Spirit, and yet he cried with a loud voice. So if reverence isn't necessarily quiet, what is it?</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about what the opposite of reverence is? Certainly we think, "It has to be irreverence," and that would be correct in the strictest sense. But maybe we can understand irreverence if we consider a synonym for irreverence. Here is a fascinating well-known quote from President Spencer W. Kimball:</p>
<p>"I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns" (<em>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</em>&nbsp;ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 135).</p>
<p>President Kimball seems to suggest that he is not reverent-that he is not receiving answers to prayer-when he is casual.</p>
<p>A few years ago Elder D. Todd Christofferson spoke at a CES fireside and said the following:</p>
<p>"The importance of having a sense of the sacred is simply this-if one does not appreciate holy things, he will lose them. Absent a feeling of reverence, he will grow increasingly casual in attitude and lax in conduct. He will drift from the moorings that his covenants with God could provide. His feeling of accountability to God will diminish and then be forgotten. Thereafter, he will care only about his own comfort and satisfying his uncontrolled appetites. Finally, he will come to despise sacred things, even God, and then he will despise himself." (D. Todd Christofferson, "A Sende of the Sacred," CES Devotional, November 7, 2004)</p>
<p>"Casual in attitude," says Elder Christofferson.&nbsp; If we think about that it really makes sense. Can we imagine being in casual conversation with our friends dressing in a casual manner? Of course it's easy. But can we imagine such conversation, such casualness, in the presence of the Lord or His appointed representatives? I just don't think we can-at least I hope we can't.</p>
<p>I once heard President Kim B. Clark talking about the difference in the dress and grooming standards at BYU-Idaho compared with other Church universities. He said, "We have chosen to be less casual." I found myself thinking he was attempting to engender a greater spirit of reverence.</p>
<p>I think with very little effort we can realize that respect is a key, central component to reverence. A reverent person is a respectful person. But there is another component of reverence which I find particularly profound and remarkably under appreciated. Let me give you another definition of reverence in addition to the one we heard from President McKay. This is from the <em>Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball</em>: "Reverence has been defined as a 'feeling or attitude of deep respect, love, and awe, as for something sacred.'"</p>
<p>I'd like to devote most of the rest of our time together on this idea: awe. In the April <ins cite="mailto:MediaTransfer" datetime="2016-08-13T20:23">2</ins>, 2016 edition of <em>The Deseret News</em>, there was an article called "<ins cite="mailto:MediaTransfer" datetime="2016-08-13T20:23">Awe-the sensation that unites</ins>." &nbsp;The author, Kelsey Dallas, said that research suggests that sharing feelings of awe-of wonder-will cause people to reflect more deeply about their own lives and to get along more successfully with others around them.</p>
<p>I found in that article this quotation from Albert Einstein:</p>
<p>"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead-his eyes are closed. The insight into the mystery of life...has also given rise to religion. To know what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms-this knowledge, this feeling is at the center of true religiousness."</p>
<p>&nbsp; If we don't feel this sense of awe, we can't be reverent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Children have a natural sense of awe. Maybe this is one of the reasons the Savior on numerous occasions commanded us to become as a little child. This feeling of awe and wonder so common to little children is not a sign of either weakness or ignorance. In fact, ignorant people are more likely to not feel awe, because of a lack of understanding and a failure to grasp context. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Deseret News</em> article I referenced earlier made mention of Brother Guy Consolmagno, the director of the Vatican Observatory, who holds advanced university degrees in planetary science. He's quoted as follows: "If you know the science, the nuts and bolts, the thrills are still there. You've just got another reason...to be excited about it." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Donald L. Hallstrom tells of the time while living in Hawaii years ago at the time of the rededication of the Laie Temple-he was asked by the temple rededication committee to be responsible for security and transportation arrangements for President Kimball and his party-what he calls "behind the scenes." During that week he saw President Kimball close up ministering to others, dedicating a temple, and teaching. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then in his own words, &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the week's conclusion we were at the airport for the departure of President Kimball and his associates... President Kimball came to me to thank me for my meager efforts. Physically he was not very tall, and I am a large man. He grabbed me by my jacket lapels and sharply yanked me down to be at his height. Then he kissed me on the cheek and thanked me. After walking away a few steps, President Kimball returned. He grasped me in the same way and pulled me down again. This time he kissed me on the other cheek and told me that he loved me. Then he departed. The year before, a biography of Spencer W. Kimball had been published... At that time, I had obtained it and read it, and I found it interesting. However, after this very personal experience with Spencer Woolley Kimball, I went home from the airport and pulled that thick volume from our library shelf, feeling an intense desire to read it again. Over the next several days-every waking hour I was not otherwise obligated-I was reading and reflecting. You see, I was now reading about someone whom I deeply loved. I was now reading about someone whom I knew loved me. I was now reading about someone for whom I would do anything, because I knew whatever he asked would be for my own best good. (Donald L. Hallstrom, "How Firm a Foundation," CES Devotional, November 2, 2014)</p>
<p>The more he knew of President Kimball, the greater his sense of awe.</p>
<p>Contrast these two scriptural passages about a lack of reverence, a lack of familiarity:</p>
<p>To Laman and Lemuel Nephi said, "Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, <em>but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words</em>; wherefore, he has spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as if it were to divide asunder" (1 Nephi 17:45, emphasis added).</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul, speaking of non-believers in Ephesians 4:</p>
<p>This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,</p>
<p>Having the understanding darkened, <em>being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:</em><strong></strong></p>
<p>Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</p>
<p>But ye have not so learned Christ. (Ephesians 4:17-20, emphasis added)</p>
<p>If we don't feel this awe, if we are not reverent, then we are what Einstein calls "as good as dead." Paul references "the ignorance that is in them." The first part of the mission statement of BYU-Idaho is to help strengthen and develop testimonies of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It seems to me that learning-that is to say the reduction of ignorance-is a key part of this if (and this is sometimes a big "if") we seek that feeling of awe. Do we understand the context of something enough to recognize the wonder, or do we let it become too common, too familiar? Reverence extends to many areas of our lives, or ought to.</p>
<p>I once read about a president of the United States who said he felt such awe and respect for all that the office of the presidency and the White House entailed that he refused to ever remove his suit jacket while in the Oval Office. For him it was a matter of respect based on an understanding of context.</p>
<p>I remember several years ago, my brother Earl and I were in the city of Compiegne in northern France trying to find the ward building for sacrament meeting. We were standing on a street corner that had an enormous, old stone wall fragment extending partially around.&nbsp; Unlike Idaho, France is full of old stone wall fragments, some of them many centuries old. It's easy to take them for granted. I casually looked up at the sign that was attached to the stone wall, and in a few moments my casual feeling was replaced with one of reverence. My ignorance was gone. The sign said "Tour Jeanne d'Arc" (Joan of Arc Tower). I suddenly realized where we were. On May 23, 1430, 18-year-old Joan of Arc was captured in the city of Compiegne trying to free France from foreign oppression. She was then a prisoner in a stone tower and subsequently sold to the English, where she was then tried and executed. That stone wall was the vestige, the remnant of where Joan had been held nearly 600 years earlier. We were standing in the middle of a profound historic location. If Joan of Arc had not freed France from English rule, then the young United States would have had no ally in the revolution against Britain 350 years later. No successful American Revolution and no restoration of the gospel. &nbsp;I felt awe; I knew the context of the place.</p>
<p>Carl Sandburg described the irreverence that accompanies ignorance in a passage from his poem "Grass." Speaking of the great battlefields of the past and the forgetfulness that comes from the passage of time, he writes, "Two years, ten years, and passengers ask the conductor: / What place is this? / Where are we now?"</p>
<p>I'm convinced one of the reasons we are required to study science and the arts at BYU-I is to help us gain a sense of context-and a sense of wonder. Awe, not through ignorance but through experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>Here's what President Hinckley said in a BYU devotional in March 1992.</p>
<p><a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/Vaughn+Stephenson+Devotional+-+Gordon+B.+Hinckley+Clip/0_1h069hbj" target="_blank">https://video.byui.edu/media/Vaughn+Stephenson+Devotional+-+Gordon+B.+Hinckley+Clip/0_1h069hbj</a></p>
<p>What President Hinckley is talking about is wonder and awe: reverence.</p>
<p>When we visit Yellowstone Park (something every student should do at BYU-Idaho) are we filled with awe?</p>
<p>Do our experiences on "trek" give us a greater reverence for the actual experiences of our pioneer forebears? Can we ponder and feel awe? &nbsp;</p>
<p>When we learn about the creations of Michelangelo, of Bernini, of Bach and Mozart, do we experience awe? If I have presented those things in my humanities class and we do not share a sense of awe and wonder, then I feel much like the words of the hymn "Have I Done Any Good?" and say to myself, "If not, I have failed indeed." (Have I Done Any?, <em>Hymns</em>, No. 223</p>
<p>The tithe payers of the Church spend large amounts of money so that we can be educated in the arts and the sciences. Certainly we owe it to them and to ourselves to become more reverent, to recognize that which is not easily explained.</p>
<p>As we go about our lives, a sense of awe, of reverence, will make us kinder, better people in a world which today thrives on sarcasm, irreverence, debunking, and disrespect.</p>
<p>But there's another important role of reverence.</p>
<p>Elder Hallstrom said that he realized from his experience with President Kimball that he recognized the need for greater reverence in his life:</p>
<p>"Through the exhilaration of that experience I had another experience... I comprehended that I did not have that same love and respect-reverence-for Those who matter the most: the members of the Godhead and, specifically, God's Only Begotten, the Savior and the Redeemer. This motivated me to study His "biography" and, through prayer and fasting and pondering, to know that I was now reading about someone whom I deeply loved. I was now reading about someone who I knew loved me." (Donald L. Hallstrom, "How Firm a Foundation," CES Devotional, November 2, 2014)</p>
<p>Do we have proper reverence for God and for His beloved Son? I worry if we merely think of Christ as our generous big brother that we are lessening the profound respect mingled with awe that we should feel. If we reflect on that which we cannot truly understand nor fully comprehend, namely the Atonement, we ought to be left reverent, awe struck. Some hymns have suggested these feelings:</p>
<p>Stewart K. Hine wrote, "And when I think that God, His Son not sparing, / Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in." (How Great Thou Art, <em>Hymns</em>, No. 86)</p>
<p>Charles Gabriel I think describes it as effectively as anyone has ever done in these words which reflect profound respect mingled with awe: "I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me, confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me. I tremble to know that for me he was crucified... Oh it is wonderful to me." (I Stand All Amazed, <em>Hymns,</em> No. 193) &nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, to close, I'm not saying we shouldn't be quiet in church. If anything, we should be more attentive. I am saying that we need to ponder and understand more about all around us so that we can more fully experience the profound respect mingled with awe that is at the heart of a reverent life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These words from President Kimball are an important guide for all of us: "We must remember that reverence is not a somber, temporary behavior that we adopt on Sunday. True reverence involves happiness, as well as love, respect, gratitude, and godly fear. It is a virtue that should be part of our way of life. In fact, Latter-day Saints should be the most reverent people in all the earth." (Spencer W. Kimball, We Should Be a Reverent People," <em>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball</em>, 156) &nbsp;</p>
<p>May we be more reverent is my humble prayer today, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Greetings, brothers and sisters. It's good to be at devotional with you today.<br /><br />I love my wife, Brenda. She says nice things about me in public <em>and</em> in private. She's an amazing woman, teacher, and mother with many talents, which she freely shares. She is a stalwart member of the Church and a leader who knows how to minister to her flock. She is cute too! &nbsp;</p>
<p>I love my children! Nathan, Aaron, Camryn, and Allyson are amazing. Each of them is my favorite child. They have brought great joy into my life. I love teaching them and watching them progress through this life, especially when they get back up after they stumble. The world is a better place with them in it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For those folks who help put this devotional together, please accept my gratitude. To those in attendance, wherever you may be, I pray that the Spirit will teach you and lift you. This is an opportunity that I don't take lightly. I have earnestly pondered and prayed for inspiration to know what Heavenly Father would have me say to you today. I invite you to write down your thoughts and impressions, and hope you will find a way to get these thoughts and impressions from your brain down deep into your heart. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the gospel is fun for me! I enjoy life! I enjoy students! I relish working with them, chastising them, encouraging them, and building them up. I truly love seeing them develop and grow into disciple-leaders who add value wherever they go. I want all students to know how we (the faculty, administration, and staff) feel about you-we love you!&nbsp; We love teaching you, and we feel fortunate to be able to weave the doctrines and principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in our teaching that you might deepen your testimonies of this great and marvelous work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My friends, let's go back in time to late November of 1989. I was a senior attending Malad High School (Idaho); the Oakland A's had just won the World Series; popular hairstyles were spiked for boys and big hair (i.e. lots of Aqua Net) for the girls; Milli Vanilli was at the top of the pop charts; cell phones and the Internet were not available to the common man; and would you believe Robin Williams, the guy who played Mork and Mrs. Doubtfire, inspired a nation with this phrase from the movie <em>Dead Poets Society</em>: "Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary." <br /> <br /> With that background, I would like to tell a story that my mother wrote about a family trip to Oregon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It was very cold, about 34 degrees, with sleeting rain through the Columbia River Gorge.&nbsp; Da'lynne, Laura, Zane, Dad (Richard), and I (DayOnna) were in the gray Starcraft van heading back to Malad, Idaho, from Aloha, Oregon, where we had spent the Thanksgiving holiday with Grandma Bowen. Roger and Tyler stayed back in Malad because of basketball practices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a bed set up in back of the van so anyone could lie down and try to sleep because the trip took nearly 14 hours to complete.&nbsp; Dad drove us to John Day but was tired of fighting the weather, so he climbed in the back to rest, and I started driving. As usual, all the kids were fighting over the front seat, yelling back and forth, "Shotgun!"&nbsp; Zane, eight years old and the youngest child, had no say in the matter; therefore, he was sitting in his usual spot on top of the cooler between the two front seats. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Times have changed. We had no car seats for kids and no seat belt laws, nor cell phones nor iPads to entertain the kids. Can you imagine? Continuing from my mom's journal entry: &nbsp;</p>
<p>I had been driving about an hour when everyone began complaining that they needed to go to the bathroom.&nbsp; The Boardman rest stop was coming up, so I pulled in. With Dad asleep in the back of the van, all the kids and I got out to use the facilities. When I got back to the car, I asked the kids if we were all there, and they responded, "Yes." &nbsp;</p>
<p>We started down the road with the intention to get across the Blue Mountains before it got dark and temperatures dropped to freezing. When I hit Pendleton, the kiddy choir started up again, all professing their undying hunger. I didn't want to pull over, but there was a McDonald's at the last Pendleton exit just before we started up the Blue Mountains range. I pulled in to the McDonald's parking lot and turned off the car. I turned to Zane and asked him to wake Dad and get some money. He got a funny look on his face like "oh no!" I asked him again to wake Dad and get money, and he responded, "I can't; he is not here." &nbsp;</p>
<p>"What! Where is he?" I asked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Zane replied, "Back at the rest stop."&nbsp; Apparently Dad woke up after the girls, Zane, and I went to the restroom. As Zane came out of the men's room, he saw Dad go in but didn't think to tell us about it until I asked him to get the money from Dad. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, I turned around and hot-footed it back to Boardman going 90 miles an hour. It took an hour to backtrack. (DayOnna Williams)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let me be very clear here.&nbsp; What my dad went through was not a pleasant experience. He left his coat in the car and tried to stay warm by running his hands under the hand dryer in the men's restroom. Yet he would be the first one to tell you that he is as guilty of forgetfulness as the next person. Let me explain. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The year was 1977.&nbsp; <em>Star Wars</em> debuted, the Portland Trailblazers won the NBA Championship, disco music was all over the radio, and bell-bottom pants were in style. Shortly after moving from Genola, Utah, to Aloha, Oregon, my father took my brother Roger (2) and I (5) to the church to watch him and his buddies play basketball while my mom and newborn sister, Da'lynne, rested back home. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After an hour of watching Dad play, I was fed up and wanted to go home. Dad told me, "We'll leave in a minute." Well, a minute turned into 10 minutes, and I had had it. So I grabbed my coat and started walking the five-mile journey back home. I had walked nearly two and a half miles when I decided that I needed to cross the Tualatin Valley (TV) Highway near the Harvey Marine store. For your information, TV Highway is one of the major thoroughfares that connects Beaverton to Hillsboro, a four-lane highway much like our own Highway 20 that connects Rexburg to Idaho Falls. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With great confidence I looked both ways for cars and determined that it was time to cross. Just then, a kind lady yelled out from her front porch, "Little boy, are you lost?"&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned around and confidently said, "No! I'm going home." &nbsp;</p>
<p>She asked, "Where are your parents?"&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I replied, "My mom is home with my baby sister, and my dad won't stop playing basketball at the church."&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>She then asked, "Do you know your phone number so we can call your mom?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I said, "Yes. 649-5856." I still remember that number to this day. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The kind lady called my mother only to find that my dad had already called home to notify mom that I was missing. Mom was panicked and none too happy with my father. Much to her relief, arrangements were made for me to be dropped off at my home, and all turned out well, at least for me-Dad, not so much. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A few months later, when calm was restored, my parents and some friends went out to eat when the conversation started about our little adventure. Inadvertently, one of the men who was playing ball with my dad blurted out, "Not only did we lose, Tyler, but we also lost Roger."&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember my little brother who went with me and my dad? Whoops! Dad had conveniently forgotten to tell Mom that Roger was also lost. Luckily, after an hour of searching the church grounds, and just about the time I was rescued, one of the ball players found Roger sound asleep under the sacrament table.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, from that moment on, Dad has been much more vigilant in keeping his eye on his children and grandchildren when out and about. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you can see from both of these stories the devastating effects that forgetfulness could have had on my family. Dad could've been stranded in the cold for a really long time.&nbsp; I could've been taken by some stranger and never returned. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I attended a training with the general Primary and Young Men's presidencies along with stake leaders from across the nation. One particular discussion focused on the struggles so many young men were having with their testimonies and activity in the Church. Many thoughts were shared, yet one struck a chord with me. The comment went something like this: "Often I find that the boys forget who they are and what they can become. They forget the Lord because they forget to do the things that will draw them nearer to Him. Forgetfulness is the plague of this generation." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it: Satan teaches people to forget the basic doctrines and principles of the restored gospel in an attempt to lure them away from God and ensnare them in his traps that lead to misery.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the scriptures and how vividly they describe the issues we face today! Listen and see if this applies to us today: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus we see how&nbsp;quick&nbsp;the children of men do&nbsp;forget the Lord their God, yea, how quick to do&nbsp;iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one. (Alma 46:8) &nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing.&nbsp; For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray. (2 Nephi 32:8) &nbsp;</p>
<p>And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish and are lost. (1 Nephi 12:17) &nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do we avoid being led astray?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In a 2002 BYU devotional address, Elder Dennis B. Neuenschwander clearly answers this question. He said, &nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me that living the gospel has as much to do with remembering important things as it does with knowing them in the first place. The word&nbsp;<em>remember </em>and its derivatives appear hundreds of times in the scriptures-certainly a lot to remember! This repetitious scriptural reminder to remember takes on added significance when we understand that in Hebrew the word&nbsp;<em>remember</em>&nbsp;has a much broader meaning than does the English connotation of "keeping something in mind." In the Hebrew context, "doing" is an essential part of the remembering process. Thus, "to remember" is "to do," whereas "forgetting" is "failing to do." (Dennis B. Neuenschwander, "Remember, Remember," <em>BYU Speeches</em>, 12 November 2002)<em></em> &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What you stand for</strong></p>
<p>In the spring of 1987, I was living in Orange County, California, in a city called Brea. U2 was very popular, <em>The Cosby Show</em> was a top TV series, the New York Giants were the Super Bowl champions, and hair styles were mullets for boys and again big hair and wings for girls.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>At that time I was introduced to a transfer student from Australia named Steve.* Steve was full of life and became quite popular at my high school. Some of the friends he made happen to be in my home ward. Steve came to church activities, which led to an invitation to learn about the restored gospel from the missionaries. He accepted and began the missionary discussions. Soon after, Steve entered the waters of baptism and was confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks after his baptism, Steve celebrated his 17th birthday. I was invited along with a bunch of his friends to come down to Huntington Beach for a bonfire, hot dogs, and s'mores.&nbsp;The night of the party came, and as I was walking out of the house, my father said something to me that I had never heard him say before, nor will I ever forget: "Remember who you are and what you stand for."&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>By the show of hands, how many of you have heard the phrase, "Remember who you are and what you stand for"? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the beach, I was greeted by a bunch of friends, along with the birthday boy. Immediately, it became clear that this was not like other LDS parties that I was accustomed to.&nbsp; Alcohol was present. It seemed like everyone had a plastic cup full of beer and were well on their way to getting drunk. Immediately my dad's statement, "Remember who you are and what you stand for," came rushing to the forefront of my mind. Other thoughts that came to my remembrance were the Sunday School and Primary lessons taught to me about the Word of Wisdom and how to "choose the right."&nbsp; I wished Steve a happy birthday, said hello to a couple of friends, then quickly and quietly left the party and safely returned home. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, there will be times in life where you will be placed in situations where you have to make a stand for what you believe-even here at BYU-Idaho. What lessons do you remember from Sunday School, Primary, seminary, family home evening, even Young Men and Women classes and activities that will help you choose the right when faced with adversity? As these lessons come to your mind, I invite you to write them down in a journal and reflect on them from time to time. I have found needed answers and great comfort in remembering lessons from the past. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the years since Steve's party, I have heard other renditions of the phrase "Remember who you are." I would like to share some of my favorite versions and the profound lessons learned from them. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Remember who you are and where you come from</strong>."<strong></strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The scriptures explain that we are children of God. The Old Testament prophet Jeremiah wrote, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, <em>and</em> I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations" (Jeremiah 1:5). &nbsp;</p>
<p>To Abraham it was revealed, "Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones" (Abraham 3:22). &nbsp;</p>
<p>We can also learn where we come from through study of our ancestors. As a nine-year-old Primary boy, I was invited to fill out a pedigree chart. While filling out my chart, I discovered many strange names that started with <em>E</em>:&nbsp; Ethel, Eris, Erma Arvilla, and Eunice. My great-grandfather was named O. G., short for Orion Genial. And who could forget the unique names of my mother and sister, DayOnna and Da'lynne? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I also found great stories of pioneer heritage. For instance, my great-great-great-grandfather, Fredrick Christian Sorensen, was born in 1819 and died in 1891. He was one of the first 16 souls baptized in Denmark on August 23, 1850. Shortly after his baptism, he fulfilled a mission in his hometown. He immigrated to Utah, arriving in October of 1853, and was one of the early settlers of Ephraim, Utah. He fulfilled another mission to Denmark from 1865 to 1867, where he presided over the Fredervia and Copenhagen conferences. He was a very active man in the Church and at home. He served in various priesthood callings and on the high council in the Sanpete Stake. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I have found great joy in learning about my ancestors. I am grateful for their lives and the efforts they put forth in building the kingdom of God on this earth. The Spirit of Elijah is real, and I have felt the promises made to my ancestors planted into my heart and my heart turned toward my ancestors. They have given me a heritage that I can be proud of. Now it is my turn to create a heritage that my posterity can be proud of. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I invite each of you to take time to learn more about your ancestors and your heritage. I also exhort you to learn about the great history of our Church. The lessons learned will strengthen your testimony of this incredible latter-day work. &nbsp; The next "Remember Who You Are" phrase is a classic<strong>: "</strong>Remember who you are, and don't let it get you down." <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Do you recall the vision Lehi had of the tree of life described in 1 Nephi 8:24-28? &nbsp;</p>
<p>And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My son Aaron recently told us a story about a farmer and a burro. It turns out that one night this burro fell into a well. After many attempts to get the burro out of the well, the farmer decided to give up and fill the well with dirt, entombing the burro. The farmer quickly became agitated with the burro because the animal would shake the dirt off its back and step up on the new dirt. He exclaimed, "Hold still so I can bury you!" Quickly, the farmer realized if the burro kept shaking the dirt off its back and continued to step up on the new dirt, the burro would eventually rise to the top and get out of the well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How well do we shake the proverbial dirt off our backs and step up on new ground to rise to new heights, which can help us hold fast to the iron rod through the mists of darkness?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please consider the counsel my wife recently received. Though directed to the women of the Church, I believe this message pertains to each and every one of us. She says, "In a recent women's meeting that I attended at Philmont Scout Ranch, Cimarron, New Mexico, the Primary general presidency addressed us. Remarks were made that at all too many times, women of the Church are unduly critical and hard on themselves. We spend too much time listening to the negative voices from all around us (within the Church and without) when we should be spending more time listening and looking upward for the validation and more accurate view of ourselves from our kind Heavenly Father, for He truly sees us as we are: beautiful daughters of God!" (Brenda Williams) &nbsp;</p>
<p>Amen, Brenda! The world can be so inaccurate. Even though the world may mock and point their fingers at you, a loving Heavenly Father is ready to send the Holy Ghost to comfort and guide you in times of tribulation and affliction. Will each of you commit to ask Heavenly Father how He feels about you? The Holy Ghost will give you that answer. Seek to know how the Holy Ghost communicates with you so you can receive that answer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The final "Remember Who You Are" phrase brings a smile to my face: "Remember who you are, and get excited about it!" &nbsp;</p>
<p>This sounds like something President Gordon B. Hinckley would say. Consider these words he spoke to the women of the Church in April of 2001. Some words have been modified because I believe this message applies to all of God's children. He states, "You are creatures of divinity; you are [children] of the Almighty. Limitless is your potential. Magnificent is your future, if you will take control of it. Do not let your lives drift in a fruitless and worthless manner." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you paying attention? Listen to the instructions we are given in the next few paragraphs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For you, my dear friends, the sky is the limit. You can be excellent in every way.&nbsp; You can be first class. There is no need for you to be a scrub.&nbsp; Respect yourself. Do not feel sorry for yourself. Do not dwell on unkind things others may say about you. Particularly, pay no attention to what [somebody] might say to demean you.&nbsp; [They] are no better than you. In fact, [they have] already belittled [themselves] by [their] actions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Polish and refine whatever talents the Lord has given you.&nbsp; Go forward in life with a twinkle in your eye and a smile on your face, but with great and strong purpose in your heart. Love life and look for its opportunities, and forever and always be loyal to the Church... &nbsp;</p>
<p>Never forget that you came to earth as a child of the divine Father, with something of divinity in your very makeup. The Lord did not send you here to fail.&nbsp; He did not give you life to waste it. He bestowed upon you the gift of mortality that you might gain experience-positive, wonderful, purposeful experience-that will lead to life eternal.&nbsp; He has given you this glorious Church, His Church, to guide you and direct you, to give you opportunity for growth and experience, to teach you and lead you and encourage you, to bless you with eternal marriage, to seal upon you a covenant between you and Him that will make of you His chosen [child], one upon whom He may look with love and with a desire to help. May God bless you richly and abundantly, my dear young friends, His wonderful [children]. (Gordon B. Hinckley, "How Can I Become the Woman of Whom I Dream?" <em>Ensign</em>, April 2001) &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Testimony</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Heavenly Father is real, and He loves each of us. He has a plan for us where the end goal is exaltation, or in other words, to be like Him and inherit all that He has. I get excited pondering about that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. He willingly stepped forward to be our Redeemer and Advocate, thereby becoming the author of our salvation. He is the Head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and reveals His will to the prophets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph Smith is the prophet of this last dispensation. Through him God restored the fullness of the gospel in these latter days. I have known this since I was a Primary-aged boy and have had many witnesses since that confirm this truth to me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are led by living prophets. I declare that Thomas S. Monson has been called by God to be the president of the Church at this time and to hold all the necessary priesthood keys for our exaltation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon is the word of God, as are the Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, and the words of our latter-day prophets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>May I conclude with the inspired words that the prophet Helaman taught his sons: "And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall" (Helaman 5:12). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that these things are true, but more importantly I testify that they are <em>real</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon, brothers and sisters.&nbsp; It really is a pleasure to have the opportunity to address you today.&nbsp; I wish to address you on a topic that has significance to me both professionally and spiritually.&nbsp; As I contemplated what I might say to you today, a quote by a contemporary artist came to mind.&nbsp; This artist is one that students in my class study and does not work in traditional drawing or painting or sculpture, but he works with projected light and in creating spaces where you focus on light.&nbsp; In describing what influences his work, he describes how, as a young boy, he was taught by his grandmother that the reason for going to church was to "greet the light" (Turrell, 2001). Light is often related to spirituality.&nbsp; The struggle between good and evil, or light and dark, is a common theme in the scriptures as well as in other aspects of our culture.&nbsp; <br /><br />Light has a very profound significance for me professionally.&nbsp; All artists work with light.&nbsp; One of the most basic elements of art is a term we call <em>value</em>. Value is the representation of light and dark.&nbsp; In order to paint or draw something that looks realistic, a good understanding of light is essential.&nbsp; An artist needs to understand the properties of light.&nbsp; What happens when light reflects off of an object?&nbsp; Or what happens when light is refracted through something transparent?&nbsp; When rendering an object in a drawing, one needs to understand how light reacts with the shape and form of the subject matter.&nbsp; Some questions an artist may ask in the process of a drawing are things like: From what direction does the light come?&nbsp; How intense is the light?&nbsp; How does light reflect off of a shiny surface versus a dull surface?&nbsp; What part of the object is in shadow?&nbsp; What is the shape of the shadow cast by the object?&nbsp; Where does light hit the object directly, causing a highlight?&nbsp; All of these considerations deal with how light interacts with an object, and if the artist can't see these things, then he is unable to accurately represent the object in the drawing.<br /><br />To describe the ability to create the illusion of light and shadow in a drawing or painting, artists during the Renaissance began to use the term <em>chiaroscuro</em>, which is an Italian word meaning "light and dark."&nbsp; Impressionist paintings like Claude Monet's paintings of haystacks, cathedrals, and water lilies were studies on the effects of light on those subjects.&nbsp; An artistic process with which you are more familiar would not be possible without light.&nbsp; You all probably take digital photographs.&nbsp; The term <em>photography</em> literally means "writing with light." Light is focused through a lens and is recorded on a sensor in your camera, which you then view in the light emitted from your phone or tablet or computer screen.<br /><br />It is the contrast between light and dark that allows us to see images like I just described.&nbsp; The contrast between light and dark is often a topic of stories and movies we all read or watch.&nbsp; Light is often compared to good and darkness equated with evil.&nbsp; <br /><br />Light has great spiritual significance as well.&nbsp; In the gospel, we are taught that all of God's children come to earth with the light of Christ.&nbsp; We are taught that the light of Christ is like our conscience and prepares us to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; But I would submit that the light of Christ is much more significant than most of us realize.&nbsp; <br /><br />In D&amp;C 88:7-13 it states,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is the light of Christ. As also he is in the sun, and the light of the sun, and the power thereof by which it was made. <br /><br />As also he is in the moon, and is the light of the moon, and the power thereof by which it was made; <br /><br />As also the light of the stars, and the power thereof by which they were made; <br /><br />And the earth also, and the power thereof, even the earth upon which you stand. <br /><br />And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings; <br /><br />Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space&mdash;<br /><br />The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things.</p>
<p>I believe that the light of Christ is much more than just having a conscience.&nbsp; This verse of scripture suggests it is something much more powerful.&nbsp; It is the influence of the power of the Savior.&nbsp; This is the influence of the one who created the heavens and earth.&nbsp; It is His influence that helps us to enlighten our eyes and quicken our understanding.&nbsp; The light of Christ is the influence that allows all people to do good works in the world, regardless of whether or not one has received the gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; It is the light of Christ that influences people to seek out and accept the gospel and to become baptized and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/8.12?lang=eng#11">John chapter 8, verse 12</a>, we find Christ speaking to the Pharisees, saying, "I am the <em>light of the world</em>: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the <em>light</em> of life" (emphasis added).<br /><br />The Savior promised that if we follow Him, we will have the light of life.&nbsp; The Savior was the perfect example of how we should live our lives.&nbsp; He is the light to which we should look.&nbsp; Christ also provides a light for us through His atoning sacrifice.&nbsp; It is through Jesus Christ that we can repent and be saved.&nbsp; It is through Jesus Christ that we all will overcome death.&nbsp; It is through His Atonement that we may receive eternal life.&nbsp; If we follow Him we will not need to walk in darkness.<br /><br />Have you ever been in a place where there is no light?&nbsp; When I was a college student, my friends and I hiked into a cave near Logan, Utah. We were prepared with food and water and, most importantly, flashlights. We hiked about a mile into the mountain, and at the end of our hike in the cave, in a somewhat open chamber, we sat down to eat a snack and drink some water.&nbsp; At one point, we wanted to see what it would be like to be in the dark, so we turned off all of the lights.&nbsp; I will not forget the feeling of being in complete darkness.&nbsp; You could not see your hand if you held it an inch from your face.&nbsp; You lose all sense of direction.&nbsp; You cannot tell left from right or up from down.&nbsp; You can't tell where you are from where you have been.&nbsp; You do not dare to move for fear of running into something or falling, and you can feel helpless.&nbsp; It would be difficult, if not impossible, to find your way out of the cave without light. &nbsp;I cannot imagine physically walking in complete darkness.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thankfully, we do not have to walk in complete spiritual darkness.&nbsp; When my friends and I emerged from the cave on our little spelunking adventure, it was about 10 p.m.&nbsp; It was dark outside but not nearly as dark as in the cave.&nbsp; It is amazing how much light the moon and stars give us.&nbsp; In our lives we do not need to walk in darkness.&nbsp; We have all been given the light of Christ to help illuminate our way.&nbsp; We also have the gift of the Holy Ghost to guide and direct us.&nbsp; <br /><br />Our Heavenly Father's plan is designed so that we can come to earth to gain experience and prepare to return to live with Him.&nbsp; We are taught that if we are faithful in this life, then we "shall have glory added upon [our] heads for ever and ever" (Abraham 3:26).&nbsp; When I think of the word <em>glory</em>, I associate it with light and beauty.&nbsp; I think of Joseph Smith's description in the Sacred Grove, when he said, "I saw a pillar of&nbsp;light&nbsp;exactly over my head, above the brightness of the&nbsp;sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. . . . When the light rested upon me I&nbsp;saw&nbsp;two&nbsp;Personages, whose brightness and&nbsp;glory&nbsp;defy all description" (Joseph Smith&mdash;History 1:16-17)&nbsp; <br /><br />I have always focused on the pairing of the words <em>brightness</em> and <em>glory</em> and how they are used together.&nbsp; Brightness is associated with light.&nbsp; A scripture that uses the words <em>light</em> and <em>glory</em> is Doctrine and Covenants 93:36. It&nbsp;states, "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth." So God's glory is intelligence, and intelligence is light and truth. &nbsp;<br /><br />One of the primary reasons for our experience on earth is to gain knowledge and intelligence.&nbsp; All of you are in school to participate in this activity. Being engaged in learning and teaching is a significant way to add more light to your life.&nbsp; There is also a great blessing promised for those who have light and truth.<br /><br />D&amp;C 93:37&nbsp;states, "Light and truth forsake that evil one."&nbsp; I believe that the more we focus on gaining light, the less likely we are to give in to temptation&mdash;the less likely we are to become involved in those things that will extinguish our light.<br /><br />Each of you has come to school to learn.&nbsp; I hope you are considering that you have come to college to not only earn a degree but to gain knowledge and understanding that will help you be successful in the future, both in your chosen career and in other aspects of your life.&nbsp; The mission of BYU-Idaho lists four areas to help you become successful.<em> </em>First is to help you build testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Second is to provide you a quality education.&nbsp; Third is to prepare you for lifelong learning, for employment, and for your roles as citizens and parents.&nbsp; And fourth is to maintain for you a wholesome academic, cultural, social, and spiritual environment.&nbsp; Notice that the mission of the university is not just about earning a degree.&nbsp; There are other aspects of learning in which you have the opportunity to participate.</p>
<p>In other words, you are here to be educated, which I believe is more than earning a degree. &nbsp;So the light you gain here is about learning how to be successful in your chosen major, but it also is about strengthening your testimony.&nbsp; The light you gain here also represents the ability for you to work in ways you never thought of.&nbsp; It is about teaching others.&nbsp; The light you gain is about becoming a lifelong learner.&nbsp; It is highly unlikely that you will learn everything you need to know in your discipline in eight semesters.&nbsp; I have colleagues that I highly respect for their artistic ability.&nbsp; Some of them have worked as artists for 30-40 years.&nbsp; They are great examples to me because I have the opportunity to learn from their experience.&nbsp; They are able to teach me things about art that I didn't know before.&nbsp; But they are also great examples to me because they demonstrate a desire to continue to learn.&nbsp; They look for ways to see better and improve their artwork.&nbsp; They are true lifelong learners.&nbsp; <br /><br />Part of the mission of the university is to help you learn your subject matter for your major within the context of the light of the gospel.&nbsp; In my discipline, like in many others, we sometimes have to study some challenging subjects necessary for being professional in the field. I tell my students that they are blessed because we can do this in the context of the light of the gospel.<em></em><br /><br />D&amp;C 109:7&nbsp;says, "Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom, seek learning even by study and also by faith."<br /><br />As you learn here, you will study many things that will give you experience to meet challenges in your life.&nbsp; You will learn things that can help you be successful in a career.&nbsp; You will learn things that will help you be a good parent and spouse.&nbsp; And you will learn things that will help you increase your testimony of the gospel.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are taught that the more we learn, the better off we will be when we leave our mortal existence.&nbsp; D&amp;C 130:19 states, "If a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come."<br /><br />So gaining light and knowledge is an important part of our progression toward eternal life.&nbsp; We should always take advantage to learn new things.&nbsp; Often we focus on wanting to learn only those things that we perceive apply to us.&nbsp; For example, we may resist wanting to take a class that is outside of our major.&nbsp; Or we may complain that we had to take a class that didn't apply to what we want to do. &nbsp;I felt this as a student sometimes.&nbsp; What I didn't realize, though, was that many of those things that I didn't perceive to be significant really did mean something and contributed to my overall education.&nbsp; It is easier to see that in hindsight. &nbsp;I think that we have an opportunity to learn something in any situation we are in.&nbsp; It is okay to learn some things that are outside of your major.&nbsp; I work in the field of art education.&nbsp; But it is very helpful to be educated about more than just art.&nbsp; Learning history, math, science, and language has been a very important part of my education.&nbsp; All of these subjects have informed either my own art or the art of the students that complete assignments in my classes.&nbsp; If I did not know anything about other subjects, my artwork would simply be about making art or would be less effective renderings of subjects I didn't understand very well.&nbsp; The example of understanding the properties of light, which is science, in order to complete an accurate rendering of something, demonstrates this point.<br /><br />Every day, we are confronted with opportunities to increase our light as well as opportunities to diminish that light.&nbsp; Sometimes we get put in situations where it is difficult to decide if a particular activity will really be uplifting.&nbsp; Often we go through our daily activities without thinking much about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.19?lang=eng#18">Moroni 7:16-19</a> gives us a pattern to follow in determining what adds light and what extinguishes it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, my brethren, seeing that ye know the light by which ye may judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully; for with that same judgment which ye judge ye shall also be judged.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search diligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn it not, ye certainly will be a child of Christ.</p>
<p>So as we consider various activities with which to participate, I would invite you to take Moroni's advice.&nbsp; Consider if the activity you choose to do will add to your light, or at the very least not diminish it.&nbsp; Does my conduct and speech represent who I should be?&nbsp; Does the media I view or participate in extinguish my light?&nbsp; Am I adding to my light with scripture study, prayer, and service to others?</p>
<p>Some of us may find that it is hard to move away from some things that may not be adding light to our lives.&nbsp; Some of us may not realize that there are influences that take light from us.&nbsp; Some of us may simply be looking for ways to add more light and become better.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.24?lang=eng#23">D&amp;C 50:24</a> explains, "That which is of God is <em>light</em>; and he that receiveth <em>light</em>, and continueth in God, receiveth more <em>light</em>; and that <em>light groweth brighter and brighter</em> until the perfect day" (emphasis added).<br /><br />So if we receive light and continue in God, we will receive more light until we are perfected.&nbsp; Just like Alma promises when he talked about faith beginning with a simple desire to believe, if we can begin to work on doing those things that add light to our lives, then we will be given more and more light.<br /><br />As you have studied here at BYU-Idaho, you have probably found that an integral part of your learning deals with teaching others in your classes.&nbsp; As we receive light, we are expected to share that light with others.&nbsp; The well-known verses from the Sermon on the Mount state, "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.&nbsp; Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.&nbsp; Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:14-16).<br /><br />One of my favorite stories from the Book of Mormon was that of Ammon and King Lamoni.&nbsp; Ammon and the other sons of Mosiah went to preach the gospel among the Lamanites on their 14-year mission.&nbsp; What I like about the story of Ammon and King Lamoni is that Ammon did not start preaching anything.&nbsp; He was taken before King Lamoni.&nbsp; Ammon first started by explaining that he wished to live in the land for a while.&nbsp; It does not say what King Lamoni saw in Ammon, only that Lamoni was pleased with Ammon enough that Ammon was allowed to stay and was offered one of the king's daughters for a wife. &nbsp;Ammon declined and volunteered to be the king's servant.&nbsp; <br /><br />The story is a familiar one to many of you, where Ammon tends to the king's sheep and defends the flock from a group of Lamanites who attempt to scatter the sheep.&nbsp; The servants of King Lamoni are afraid, but Ammon courageously steps up and protects the flock by slaying a number of the Lamanites with a sling and cutting the arms off of anyone who raised a sword against him.&nbsp; Then, when he has taken care of the sheep, he returns to tend to the king's horses.&nbsp; He does not brag or boast.&nbsp; He does not try and convince the king to listen to him because he is so great.&nbsp; The king has to ask the servants where Ammon is.&nbsp; Ammon is then called before the king to explain what happened, and when he does, he is able to have the conversation about the nature of God because Lamoni is prepared for it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The reason that Ammon was able to convert Lamoni and his people began with his example, not with him telling the people to repent.&nbsp; Ammon was living in accordance with the teachings of the Savior.&nbsp; Ammon had a testimony and the light of the gospel in his life.&nbsp; It was by his example of serving his fellowmen that the door was opened for him to share the gospel.<br /><br />At some point you will leave the university.&nbsp; Wherever you go, you have the opportunity to let your light shine.&nbsp; <br /><br />In his address titled "A Steady Upward Course,"<em> </em>given in a devotional in 2001, President Henry B. Eyring promised,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The day will come that that capacity to influence people around you for good will have you singled out as one of the great leaders in whatever place you're in. They will not quite know why, but you will know that the reason you are being singled out is not because of your innate gifts as a leader but because you have done what the Savior would do&mdash;learned how to, and did, reach out to those around you to try to lift them, to help them to be better even when it might be a little bit difficult and you might not have been received very well.</p>
<p>This is a great promise.&nbsp; We all have the opportunity to be an influence for good, and the way we can do that is by simply following the Savior's example.&nbsp; When we give of our light, not only do we bless the lives of others; we are also uplifted.&nbsp; There have been times where I have been assigned to serve someone and found out through the experience that I got as much or more out of the experience than perhaps the person I was serving.&nbsp; It is amazing how we receive more light when we give of ours to others.</p>
<p>Today there are many influences that do not contribute light to the world.&nbsp; In fact, we watch as the values in society depart from the teachings of the Savior.&nbsp; There are many who confuse light for darkness and darkness for light.&nbsp; &nbsp;As <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/5.20?lang=eng#19">Isaiah 5:20</a> says, "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for <em>light</em>, and <em>light</em> for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!" (Emphasis added)&nbsp; <br /><br />Part of what I study and teach in my classes relates very much to each of you.&nbsp; Some of you may not realize it or may take it for granted.&nbsp; Did you realize that artists play a significant role in your lives?&nbsp; The reason I bring this up is because you are influenced by art every day.&nbsp; From the design of your cereal box in the morning to the websites you visit, the movies and TV shows you watch, the photographs you view, the movie posters at the theater, the illustrations in your textbooks and other books you read, advertisements on billboards, artwork hanging on the walls of campus buildings, and I could go on and on.&nbsp; In my class we call all of this imagery that is around us every day "contemporary visual culture." <br /><br />Many of the things that you see are created in some way or another by artists.&nbsp; Yes, people who can draw and design.&nbsp; For example, we watch a live-action movie and we are entertained, but we do not often think about what went into producing the film.&nbsp; Part of the production of a film entails a studio hiring artists to draw out each scene in what is called storyboards.&nbsp; The purpose for storyboards is so that the filmmakers can visualize what each shot will look like when they have actors in place.&nbsp; In addition to this, studios hire artists to create concept art; design color schemes; and in many cases, create backgrounds and characters in a digital environment.&nbsp; These are all done by people trained in art. <br /><br />As you look at these images presented by our visual culture, whether it be a movie or any other type of imagery you see, you should understand that they are designed with a purpose: to get noticed using principles that are known to be able to get your attention.&nbsp; Artists and designers spend a lot of time studying how to do this.&nbsp; Often it is clear to discern what the imagery we are viewing means.&nbsp; Other times it is harder.&nbsp; Sometimes we don't consider what it really means and just consume what we see.<br /><br />Terry Barrett, a professor and researcher in the field of art education, said this about the importance of interpreting our visual culture: "Images and objects present opinions as if they were truth, reinforce attitudes, and confirm or deny beliefs and values. If the messages carried by visual culture are not interpreted, we will be unwittingly buying, wearing, promoting, and otherwise consuming opinions with which we may or may not agree" (Barrett, 2003).<br /><br />In the art world today, as well as in popular visual culture, we see many artists that create works that attempt to push moral boundaries, seek to get cheap attention through shocking viewers, and promote values contrary to the things we know to be right. &nbsp;I would invite you to consider the imagery and information you consume, and learn to interpret what you see.&nbsp; And then I would invite you to participate in those things that you know will add to your light and to the light of others and avoid those things that will extinguish that light. <br /><br />At the dedication of the Hinckley Building on this campus in 2002, President Gordon B. Hinckley addressed the campus community.&nbsp; It was a very interesting talk, where he set aside his prepared speech and spoke extemporaneously.&nbsp; This is part of what he said to the students:<br /><br />Now, don't ever do a cheap or a tawdry or a mean or an evil thing, my dear young friends. You don't have to engage in these things. The world is on a slippery slide; it is going downhill, and it is going fast. And you are as a beacon on a hill, young people of rectitude and virtue and decency and goodness. Remain that way. Do not destroy your effectiveness. Do not become involved in any kind of behavior which would destroy you, injure you, hurt you, debilitate you in any way whatever. You don't have to do those things. You can stand above them. You must stand above them! The world will look to you as the years pass. Of that I have no doubt whatever.<br /><br />Today's world is challenging.&nbsp; It is my hope that we can focus on those things that will add to our light and that we can be an example to those around us.&nbsp; Jesus Christ is the Light of the World, and if we focus on His light and build upon His rock, we will be able to withstand the storms of today's world.&nbsp; He lives. He is our Savior and Redeemer, and I leave this with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I am grateful for this opportunity to be with you and pray that the Spirit will be in attendance and so we may all be taught and edified together this afternoon.&nbsp; Today I would like to speak about faith and the importance of a personal testimony. I wish to share with you some of the experiences that have helped me in my life and hope that today you will be able to reflect on some of your own experiences too. <br /><br /> In Hebrews 11:1 it says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Commenting on this scripture, Howard W. Hunter said, "In other words, faith makes us confident of what we hope for and convinced of what we do not see...Those who earnestly seek for God do not see him, but they know of his reality by faith. It is more than hope. Faith makes it a conviction&mdash;an evidence of things not seen."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>On LDS.org, a testimony is defined as the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A testimony is a spiritual witness given by the Holy Ghost. The foundation of a testimony is the knowledge that Heavenly Father lives and loves His children; that Jesus Christ lives, that He is the Son of God, and that He carried out the infinite Atonement; that Joseph Smith is the prophet of God who was called to restore the gospel; that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Savior's true Church on the earth; and that the Church is led by a living prophet today. With this foundation, a testimony grows to include all principles of the gospel.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><strong>Why do we need a testimony?</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong> We live in an interesting time in the world's history.&nbsp; I have observed many changes in the world in my short lifetime. When I was young, families didn't have computers in their homes.&nbsp; There was no such thing as the Internet. We didn't have cell phones; we used phones that were attached to a wall. If we were out with friends and needed to check in with our parents, we used a pay phone. Looking back at my childhood years, it seemed easier to protect our homes from evil influences of the world. Advancements in technology have been amazing.&nbsp; We have so much knowledge available at the touch of our hand.&nbsp; Family history work is much easier to do now with the development of new software programs and apps. We carry super computers in our pockets.&nbsp; We can do so much more to bless more lives using technology. Here at BYU-Idaho, we take education to the world through online degrees.&nbsp; It has also made it much easier for the adversary's influence to enter our lives.&nbsp; <br /><br /> President James E. Faust quoted Brigham Young in his talk "The Shield of Faith," saying, "It was revealed to me in the commencement of this Church, that the Church would spread, prosper, grow and extend, and that in proportion to the spread of the Gospel among the nations of the earth, so would the power of Satan rise."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>To illustrate the influence of the adversary, please look at these graphs.</p>
<p>In 1948, 91 percent of the U.S. population identified themselves as being Christian.&nbsp; In a span of 60 years going to 2008, that number dropped 13 points to 78 percent.&nbsp; Between 2008 and 2014, the number of people who identified as being Christian dropped eight points to 70 percent. A significant change for six short years.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>In addition, in 1948 two percent of the U.S. population had no religious affiliation. In 60 years that number rose 11 points to 13 percent. Between 2008 and 2014, that number rose 10 points to 23 percent. It took six years to rise almost the same percentage points as it did for the last 60 years.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>These two graphs illustrate that the adversary has hastened his attacks to thwart the progression of men and prevent as many as possible from returning back to Heavenly Father's presence.</p>
<p>President Faust taught us, "Now and in the future, vast amounts of information are becoming more accessible worldwide through electronic devices in the home, the workplace, or the local library. However, great will be the challenges and endless the problems, because with this wave of knowledge, life actually becomes more complicated...&nbsp; Never before in the history of the world has the need for faith in God been greater. Although science and technology open up boundless opportunities, they also present great perils because Satan employs these marvelous discoveries to his great advantage."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>But the good news is there are more people in the world with the knowledge that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Savior's true Church on the earth.</p>
<p>The Church membership has grown rapidly too.&nbsp; In 1947 the Church membership reached one million members. Sixty-one years later, in 2008, there were 13 million members, and today there are over 15 and a half million members of the Church worldwide.&nbsp; Also worth mentioning is when I was born there were 13 operating temples in the world. Today there are 150, and more on the way.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Can you see why it is so important for us to have faith and strengthen our testimonies?&nbsp; Our testimonies help us know our Savior Jesus Christ and our purpose for being on earth.&nbsp; Our faith will guide us so we might stay on the strait and narrow path back to our Father in Heaven.&nbsp; Sharing our testimonies will also help others as they seek to know about their purpose in life.&nbsp; When I was single, I made friends with someone who decided to come back to church after many years of inactivity.&nbsp; She struggled with faith and testimony but continued to attend church and meet with our bishop regularly. Eventually she started dating a member of our singles ward but still struggled with her testimony. She wasn't sure what she really believed, and the lure of the world seemed much more attractive than being obedient to the teachings of Jesus Christ. In one fast and testimony meeting, she was sitting on the back row next to her boyfriend, and after several testimonies had been borne, she looked at him and said, "You don't really believe this, do you?"&nbsp; He looked back at her and with all seriousness said, "Yes, yes I do." His short but sincere testimony had affected her.&nbsp; She didn't expect an answer from him with such conviction, but when it came she felt the Spirit and realized she believed too.&nbsp; She took the steps necessary to prepare to enter the temple, and they were sealed in the San Diego Temple.</p>
<p>Her story taught me a beautiful lesson about testimony.&nbsp; When you bear honest, sincere testimony, the Spirit will witness the truth of it.&nbsp; Not only will your testimony grow, but the testimony of those around you will grow.&nbsp; Never be afraid to share your testimony.&nbsp; Some may think living in Rexburg does not allow for many opportunities to share a testimony.&nbsp; When I first started working at BYU-Idaho, I thought the same thing.&nbsp; Everyone I work with is a member of the Church, a stark contrast to when I was the only member of the Church at my office in San Diego.&nbsp; My neighbors are all members.&nbsp; Except for fast and testimony meeting at church, when could I share my testimony?&nbsp; I have since learned that I have opportunities to share my testimony every day.&nbsp; After working here awhile, it didn't take long before I began recognizing that during the many discussions I was having with students, together we were each sharing our testimonies with one another. I was witnessing part of the BYU-Idaho mission statement in action: "Building testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and encouraging living its principles."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><strong>How do we gain a personal testimony?</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong> Developing a testimony happens through small and simple steps, line upon line, precept upon precept. Why are we taught every Sunday to read our scriptures and say our prayers? &nbsp;When we participate in these small and simple steps on a daily basis, we invite the Spirit into our lives.&nbsp; The Spirit can then witness to us that God exists, that we are His children, that He loves us and wants us to return back to his presence.&nbsp; Being obedient in these small and simple steps brings about great learning and blessings and a testimony. &nbsp;Our homes are a primary place where we learn gospel principles and doctrines.&nbsp; I was blessed to be taught in a home by righteous parents.&nbsp; My dad is a convert to the Church, and my mom grew up in a less-active home.&nbsp; Together they decided they would do their best to raise their family of five children in the gospel.&nbsp; They taught us to attend church on Sundays and to pray. I have fond memories of family prayer, where we would kneel together in a family circle, holding one another's hands as we prayed.&nbsp; Although we were not always perfect at holding family home evening or daily scripture study, my parents strived to make it a part of our family practice. I am grateful to my parents for striving to be obedient to these teachings, because I gained a testimony through these small and simple steps. <br /><br /> <strong>We can strengthen our testimonies through obedience.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong> I would like to share an experience where my faith and testimony was strengthened through obedience.&nbsp; As a young girl, my mother taught me the importance of keeping the Sabbath day holy.&nbsp; Her lessons penetrated my heart and helped me develop a testimony of keeping the Sabbath day holy, so recently when more focus was placed on the Sabbath day, I took note. Last summer over the pioneer weekend, we went to visit my sister and her family in Cedar City, Utah.&nbsp; Our short weekend visit would require us to return home on Sunday.&nbsp; On Saturday evening my husband and I made preparations so we could do our best to keep the Sabbath day holy while traveling.&nbsp; We went to the store and purchased food so we wouldn't have to buy any on Sunday.&nbsp; We also went to the gas station and filled up our minivan so we could make the least number of gas stops while traveling.&nbsp; <br /><br /> On Sunday morning we attended sacrament meeting with my sister's family.&nbsp; The theme of sacrament meeting was none other than keeping the Sabbath day holy.&nbsp; I must admit I wrestled with guilt that we were going to travel on the Lord's day; however, during the talks I began to feel peace.&nbsp; I had the impression that Heavenly Father knew the desires of my heart, that I was trying to do my best to keep the Sabbath day holy. After sacrament meeting was over, we said our goodbyes and proceeded to get on the road.&nbsp; In our minivan we have a mileage indicator that tells us how many miles we have left until we reach an empty tank.&nbsp; Sometime after passing Brigham City, Utah, I looked at the mileage indicator, knowing it would be time for us to get gas soon.&nbsp; To my amazement, the mileage indicator stated we still had over 200 miles left until empty, and we only had 180 miles left to Rexburg. It is almost 500 miles from Cedar City to Rexburg.&nbsp; At best&mdash;and I mean very best&mdash;we can squeeze out 370 miles in one tank. My first thought was our mileage indicator broke.&nbsp; Then I looked at the gas gauge, and there was half a tank of gas left.&nbsp; It was consistent with what the mileage indicator read.&nbsp; Could it be? Did we really have 200 miles left until empty?&nbsp; I was in denial.&nbsp; My husband wasn't sure what to make of it either.&nbsp; As we were coming up on a gas stop, we asked ourselves the question, should we stop or should we keep going?&nbsp; The logical part of me said we'd better stop and gas up, but there was a part of me that had the thought, what if this was a blessing from our desire to keep the Sabbath day holy?&nbsp;&nbsp; We decided to stay on the road.&nbsp; I can't tell you how much faith this took on my part. After we had gone a small distance, I knew we had reached that point where on any normal day our car would have run out of gas. Fear started creeping in. What were we doing staying on the road? If we ran out of gas on the freeway we would have to call for help, or my husband would have had to hike to the closest exit, buy a gas can, fill it up, and hike back.&nbsp; Both of these scenarios could have been averted if we had just filled up where we normally do, and all the fear would have gone away.&nbsp; But as we kept going, peace started replacing the fear.&nbsp; Slowly I began to recognize that we were being blessed with a small miracle to help build our testimony of keeping the Sabbath day holy. We made the 500-mile trip on one tank of gas, with 10 miles to spare.&nbsp; We refer to this experience as our family Sunday miracle, and it strengthened my testimony of many things.&nbsp; I knew my Heavenly Father knew me, loved me, and wanted to show me I was on the right path.&nbsp; <br /><br /> <strong>We can strengthen our testimonies through faithful action</strong>.<br /><br /> My husband, Marcel, is a convert to the Church.&nbsp; He has been a member for 11 and a half years now.&nbsp; I met him right after his baptism.&nbsp; During our engagement, one of Marcel's best friends, Jessica, was scheduled to have back surgery.&nbsp; She was nervous for the surgery.&nbsp; It was supposed to be fairly routine; they were going to pull out some pins and replace them in her back.&nbsp; During Jessica's surgery, one of the surgeons used the wrong clamp on her artery.&nbsp; It caused her surgery to take a turn for the worse.&nbsp; She went into a coma, and her kidneys stopped functioning.&nbsp; Soon infection started spreading through her left leg.&nbsp; Jessica's parents were at her bedside, completely helpless. Marcel and I were praying and fasting for her.&nbsp; She had been in the hospital in a coma for over 20 days with no improvement. Marcel, who had recently received the Melchizedek Priesthood, felt prompted to offer her a blessing.&nbsp; He had never given a blessing before, but his faith was so strong he knew a blessing would help Jessica.&nbsp; He called her parents and let them know he had recently been baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and had the Melchizedek Priesthood conferred upon him.&nbsp; He had the authority to give Jessica a blessing of healing.&nbsp; He explained that a priesthood blessing is given by two priesthood holders, and they would lay their hands on Jessica's head.&nbsp; This was a big deal because they were so concerned about exposing her to germs that they always wore a mask and had not let anyone come in to see her.&nbsp; &nbsp;After taking a few days to contemplate Marcel's offer, they called him back and asked if he would give Jessica a priesthood blessing, but they would not allow anyone to accompany him.&nbsp; This meant he would have to give his first priesthood blessing by himself.&nbsp; <br /><br /> In preparation for Jessica's blessing, Marcel purchased a bottle of olive oil. In the parking garage of the hospital, he carefully poured the oil into a small container and consecrated it. He then made his way to the ICU and Jessica's room. She was attached to a large machine which was taking the place of her organs.&nbsp; Her parents watched as Marcel laid his hands upon Jessica's head.&nbsp; He gave her a blessing that her infection would go away, that her kidneys would function again, and that she would come out of her coma and enjoy her family and friends again.&nbsp; During the blessing, her legs started moving and she made a sound.&nbsp; Her parents watched in amazement.&nbsp; The first thing they said after the blessing was finished was, "Did you see her legs move?"&nbsp; Later that evening, Jessica's kidneys started functioning again.&nbsp; The next morning, she woke up from her coma. The doctors couldn't believe it and couldn't explain what had happened. It was a miracle.&nbsp; My husband's testimony of the power of the priesthood was strengthened, and so was mine.<br /><br /> <strong>The adversary wants to steal your testimony.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong> He wants to do everything in his power to prevent you from living a righteous life and returning to Heavenly Father.&nbsp; He knows our weaknesses and wants to destroy each one of us.&nbsp; Please be careful with your daily decisions.&nbsp; Stay diligent in your church attendance.&nbsp; Please do your best to partake of the sacrament each week. Renewing your baptismal covenant each week gives you power over the adversary. Please read your scriptures every day and pray for Heavenly Father's help.&nbsp; Satan works in a very subtle manner.&nbsp; Just as small and simple steps work to build your faith and testimony, it is also true in the reverse.&nbsp; Your daily choices matter. Choose to do something daily that will strengthen your testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ.&nbsp; <br /><br /> As President Monson stated in his most recent conference address, "It has been said that the door of history turns on small hinges, and so do people's lives. The choices we make determine our destiny... May we choose to build up within ourselves a great and powerful faith which will be our most effective defense against the designs of the adversary&mdash;a real faith, the kind of faith which will sustain us and will bolster our desire to choose the right. Without such faith, we go nowhere. With it, we can accomplish our goals."<sup>9</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup> When I first moved to San Diego, a friend in my new singles ward asked me if I would like to take a Lindy Hop swing dance class at San Diego State. It sounded fun, so I agreed. After that class was over, Lindy Hop became a fun but consuming passion of mine.&nbsp; You had your choice of multiple swing dance venues every night.&nbsp; I made a lot of good friends who were not members of the Church, and I invited one of them to attend family home evening with me. After attending FHE a couple of times, it became apparent he wasn't interested in learning more. He wasn't fond of organized religion and questioned if God even existed.&nbsp; During the time that we were friends, he became more agnostic in his beliefs. In San Diego, Sunday is just another day off for most people, and as you can imagine, there are many fun and exciting things to do. My friend would invite me to attend some of the fun activities on Sundays.&nbsp; At first I would join him on Sunday after church.&nbsp; Then ever so slowly I noticed I would justify leaving church a little early so I wouldn't miss something I thought was really fun.&nbsp; Soon I noticed I would only stay at church long enough to take the sacrament and then leave.&nbsp; And then after a while, it became easier to justify skipping church altogether depending on what was planned for that Sunday.&nbsp; Before I knew it, I had become less active at church.&nbsp; I still tried to attend church, but I wasn't always consistent. My Sunday worship started becoming a tension point between my friend and I. He would get mad when I would decline an invitation or not leave church early. Many times, while trying to do better in my church attendance, I would give in to his requests and leave early or not attend at all because I didn't want to make him mad. There was one Sunday when I made it to Relief Society, and I remember very vividly the lesson said be careful about the influences you let in your life.&nbsp; Satan will use your friends to steal your testimony.&nbsp; I knew this lesson was for me.&nbsp; I felt the Spirit testify to me that my friend was trying to steal my testimony.</p>
<p>One day while I was having a conversation with him, he told me that I would eventually leave the Church. He said I was much too smart to stay with a religion with so many rules and that my religion was just trying to control me.&nbsp; During our conversation, I started thinking about his comment.&nbsp; Would I ever really leave the Church?&nbsp; I started thinking what my life would be like if I did.&nbsp; There was freedom to make any choice I wanted. Was this the kind of freedom I wanted?&nbsp; Was this the direction I wanted to take in my life?&nbsp; What would Heavenly Father think?&nbsp; Oh, He would be so sad if I made that decision.&nbsp; Wait, did I just think Heavenly Father would be sad?&nbsp; Why would I think that? &nbsp;Was it because I believed Heavenly Father existed?&nbsp; My thoughts turned to many of my life lessons, Primary lessons, lessons taught at home, seminary lessons, all reminding that Heavenly Father is real.&nbsp; I had a testimony that was rooted deep in my soul.&nbsp; I knew that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the true Church on earth. I had a realization that everything I had ever been taught about the gospel was real.&nbsp; I knew I could never turn my back on Heavenly Father. This was a pivotal moment in my life. Joseph Smith's testimony stated exactly how I felt: "I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not&nbsp;deny&nbsp;it."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Brothers and sisters, do not let the adversary steal your testimony. Do all you can to strengthen your testimony. If you notice it is not as strong as it should be, then do what it takes to strengthen it.&nbsp; In a devotional talk given by Mark B. Colton at BYU, he stated, "You have to fight for your testimony. There are many things we are willing to fight for. Who has been willing to go to battle, figuratively, for something they wanted badly?...Who would put up a fight if someone were trying to steal something of value from them? Your testimony is your most valuable possession, and someone <em>is</em> trying to steal it from you."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>My father had to fight for his testimony, and my mother rolled up her sleeves and fought alongside him. &nbsp;When he was 19, he found that some of his choices in life were bringing on difficult consequences. One day he was sitting on a bridge over a river, contemplating his young life and wondering if there was more meaning to this earthly experience than what he knew.&nbsp; His older brother saw him and came and sat by his side.&nbsp; As they were talking, his brother said, "Hey, I just found this new church and was baptized. You should get baptized too, and if you don't like it then you can quit in a year."&nbsp; My dad thought "Why not?" and decided to get baptized.&nbsp; He soon met my mother, and a year later they were sealed in the Cardston Alberta Temple.&nbsp; A few years later, after my sister and I were born, he was called to be a Seventy and stake missionary. His new priesthood office and calling required him to visit people and teach them about the gospel. He became very concerned about this. He didn't want to share a message with others about something that he wasn't sure was true.&nbsp; He decided he'd better find out if it was true or not.&nbsp; He had never read the Book of Mormon and really only joined the Church because in his mind it was going to keep him alive.&nbsp; He had never worked to gain a testimony; he was just going through the motions of being a member.&nbsp; But now he knew he needed to find out if what he was taught at church was real. He and my mom discussed what they should do.&nbsp; My mom had never read the book of Mormon either, so they decided they would read it together.&nbsp; They did not just casually read; they read with real intent and prayed every night. My dad was aware of Moroni's promise and had taken it to heart.&nbsp; He had a strong desire to find out if the things he had been taught at church were true.&nbsp; His desire to know of the truth and his action of reading and praying every day led to an answer.&nbsp; Somewhere in the middle of Alma, he had received a witness that the Book of Mormon was true, and his prayers changed. Instead of asking if it was true, they changed to ask for help to increase his understanding.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit bore witness to both my parents, and my dad now had a testimony of the Book of Mormon and that he was a member of the true Church on earth. His concerns for sharing the gospel were gone, and he became an enthusiastic stake missionary. &nbsp;<br /><br /> I know everyone's situation is different.&nbsp; Some might be struggling with Church history, others with recent statements put out by the Church.&nbsp; Some may have never had a strong testimony, but I encourage you to take the steps necessary to gain or strengthen your testimony. Don't let the adversary steal it away.&nbsp; You are a child of Heavenly Father.&nbsp; He gave you this mortal experience to be tried and tested.&nbsp; We all wanted to come to this earth.&nbsp; We knew it would be hard, but we wanted to come here so we could have the opportunity to receive all that our Heavenly Father has.&nbsp; We knew we would have to face and overcome trials.&nbsp; As members of the Church of Jesus Christ, we have been given the gift of knowledge of the plan of salvation.&nbsp; We understand why we are here.&nbsp; Don't let the adversary draw you away from all the blessings Heavenly Father wants to give you.&nbsp; The adversary chose a different path, and now he wants nothing more than to frustrate your progression on your path. He is doing everything he can to stop you. Don't let him. As Helaman stated to his sons Nephi and Lehi,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>Brothers and sisters, I testify to you as we work to build our faith and strengthen our testimonies, Satan will have no power over us.&nbsp; Our testimony will serve as a sure foundation, one that will not fall.&nbsp; We will withstand the mighty winds that come our way.&nbsp; In this world there will be many challenges for us to overcome, but with faith we will overcome them.&nbsp; And then we will hear the words of the Lord say to us, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou has been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of the Lord."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup>I share these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>

<p>Years ago, I befriended a group of young men in Boston. While my initial connection to these youth came from a Church calling, the relationships quickly grew to the point where I saw them the way the Lord saw them, and I grew to love them as if they were my family. And, like I would with my own children, I began to counsel and teach them things as a father would. That meant our conversations went far beyond requests to participate in stake activities or attend church. A desire grew in me to teach them so the gospel would sink deep into their hearts. Our conversations expanded to include plans for missions, how to be an effective missionary, college preparation, the importance of marriage, and early careers.</p>
<p><img alt="Boston Boys" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Boston-Boys300x200.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />Here is a picture of three of those young men when they were later students at BYU-Idaho and I was visiting as a guest of the university. In that setting, on that day, in this very auditorium, I shared with them counsel about how to succeed at BYU-Idaho and how to become who the Lord wanted them to become. <br /><br /> Today, I would like to speak to you like I have spoken to them so many times before. That means I will speak with all the love of a parent. It also means I will speak firmly in ways parents do when they are lovingly teaching, and at times correcting, their children.<br /><br /> For you to understand some of the destiny and potential each of you have as students of this university, I feel it is important for me to first teach you some of the distinctive attributes of this institution and the way the Church, its tithe payers, and our employees invest in you. When President Gordon B. Hinckley announced the creation of BYU-Idaho in June 2000, he declared that the university would have a "unique role...and be distinctive from...other institutions of higher education."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn1" title="">[1]</a><a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn1" title=""></a> <br /><br /> At BYU-Idaho, that distinctive role starts with the mission of the university to "develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> President Eyring has taught that "every innovation, every change [at BYU-Idaho] will be measured against this test of the heart. How would this proposed change build testimony and true conversion to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in the heart of a student?"<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> I hope you will take time to reflect on what it means to be in a place where everything we do is focused on this single purpose: to help you in your quest to become a disciple of Jesus Christ. <br /><br /> You should also understand that BYU-Idaho's educational emphasis is uniquely student focused. In fact, this entire university is student focused by design. For example, at BYU-Idaho, our faculty make an unambiguous commitment to teaching and advising students. Moreover, at this university you will find a belief in the extraordinary potential of every student, no matter their educational background or life circumstances. Part of this is evident in the real-world preparation we provide to our students, which includes applied learning in the classroom, internships, leadership activities, and the BYU-Idaho Learning Model itself. All of these efforts happen in ways that provide a high-quality education at an affordable cost.<br /><br /> You are at a special and distinctive place where significant investment is being made on your behalf. To reinforce the unique role of BYU-Idaho, the university created the following video. <a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> It starts with President Hinckley's announcement of the creation of this university in June 2000.<br /><br /> <a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/Fulfilling+the+Mission/0_a6tyzwni">https://video.byui.edu/media/Fulfilling+the+Mission/0_a6tyzwni</a> <br /><br /> Do you start to sense just how committed the Lord and His Church are to you and your education?<br /><br /> To understand the implied responsibility each of you have as recipients of this investment, I want to share with you a story of someone who didn't start with as much opportunity or life resources as many of today's BYU-Idaho students.<br /> Heber J. Grant was raised by a single mother. He grew up in poverty, in a home where his mother was forced to take in boarders to help provide for the family. And yet, despite these challenges, Heber J. Grant would go on to do remarkable things and later be called as an Apostle and eventually as the President of the Church. But despite his initial liability of growing up in poverty and without a father, Heber J. Grant did have one distinct advantage in his life. <br /><br /> After his father was buried, his bishop, Edwin D. Woolley, gave him a name and a blessing. In that blessing, Bishop Woolley saw by revelation that the infant boy would one day become an Apostle of the Church.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> As President Henry B. Eyring later described, "People then and since have called Heber J. Grant a 'child of promise.' He was. But his departed father didn't make the promises to the child, [nor did Bishop Woolley]. His Heavenly Father did."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn6" title="">[6]</a><a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn6" title=""></a><br /><br /> Like Heber J. Grant, the students of BYU-Idaho are children of promise; and while every one of us faces different challenges and constraints, we also have the same gifts Heber J. Grant had&mdash;supportive resources in the Church and the promise of a loving Heavenly Father who knows who we are and who we can become.<br /><br /> To realize our potential as children of promise, we have to work hard to put to work the resources the Lord has prepared for us. In this regard, we can learn from three characteristics in the life of Heber J. Grant: self-reliance, stewardship, and replenishment.<br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Self-Reliance</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong> President Grant was long known for establishing a Church welfare program on the principle of self-reliance. This principle goes far beyond the important idea of spending less than you make. Self-reliance also implies an ethic of personal responsibility that rather than sit back and wait for people to do things for you, you actively seek those resources yourself and use them responsibly and deliberately. As students at BYU-Idaho, this principle of self-reliance may apply in your search for financial resources. But rather than approaching the Student Financial Aid Office with the question of "How much can I get?" you might ask, "How much do I need?" which would require you to have built a budget and possibly find a part-time job. <br /><br /> Note that self-reliance is much more than a financial aid principle. If you are struggling in a class, being self-reliant means that you should consider going to the Tutoring Center for help. Did you know that resource is available to every student at BYU-Idaho at no cost? But you have to take the action of going to the McKay Library (or accessing online tutors). Are you frustrated that no one is dating in your apartment? Well, ask someone out or plan an event to take a date to devotional. Sister Gilbert and I provide a free date opportunity each semester at Date Night. But you have to ask; you have to take action. For those who feel they don't know people or didn't come to the university with a lot of friends, being self-reliant means you need to engage in your ward or learn someone's name in class or volunteer in the Activities program. That's what we mean by being self-reliant. The Lord has given all of us at this university abundant resources; but He expects us to use our agency to act, to engage, and to become agents unto ourselves.<br /><br /> Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;<br /> For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn7" title="">[7]</a><a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn7" title=""></a> <br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stewardship</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong> So while self-reliance is the first principle of college success, as we become increasingly self-reliant, we will begin to understand a second, higher principle: that of personal stewardship. In Matthew chapter 25, we read the parable of the talents: "And unto one he&nbsp;gave&nbsp;five&nbsp;talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> Each of you has talents that the Lord has given you. Some of those are individual spiritual gifts and personal strengths. For all of you, those talents include the remarkable resources the Lord, and His Church, has invested in you through the creation of this university. How will you use that stewardship when you graduate, and what will you give to the Lord in return for that stewardship?<br /><br /> One of those Boston young men I mentioned at the outset of my message called me the week of his graduation from BYU-Idaho and shared how he was so excited to graduate. But what I was most pleased with was that he had used his stewardship wisely and become something more than he was when he first arrived as a freshman. Yes, we want you to graduate. But we don't expect you simply to get through. We know, as the Lord knows, that you are children of promise with divine potential. <br /><br /> But you won't be a student here forever. President Eyring has taught, "Time passes at a fixed rate, and we can't store it. You can just decide what to do with it or not to do with it."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> So what are some of those stewardships of your time here at BYU-Idaho you will hand back to the Lord with increase when you leave?<br /><br /> <em>Academic Stewardship</em><em><br /></em> The first is an academic stewardship. President Uchtdorf has said that "for members of the Church, education is not merely a good idea-it's a commandment."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> At BYU-Idaho, that education begins with the introduction of the Learning Model, where we invite you to take responsibility for your learning and become the natural leaders that President Eyring has described. That stewardship extends to planning your academic future and developing your grad plan at BYU-Idaho. Use the resources in the Academic Discovery Center to help you make wise choices about what to study. That stewardship also includes your time to graduation. Did you know that your probability of being an engaged future employee nearly doubles when you graduate on time and with modest college debt?<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> Work hard in your classes. Take your education seriously. Never steal from the Lord or yourself by cheating in a class. Be a profitable servant, and return with increase the talents He has given you in this remarkable faculty and rich academic environment. <br /><br /> <em>Spiritual Stewardship</em><em><br /></em> The second stewardship you have at BYU-Idaho is a spiritual stewardship. As I described earlier, the mission of BYU-Idaho is to develop disciple-leaders. Don't come to BYU-Idaho and not allow the experience of this place to change who you are. Attend weekly devotional. Participate fully in your ward. Know and live the Honor Code. Do you know it is summarized on the back of every one of our I-Cards? <br /><br /> <img alt="I-Card" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/ICard_315x200.jpg" width="315" /><br /><br /> Let Student Honor be a pattern for the rest of your life, not something you leave behind when you graduate. Elder Bednar described BYU-Idaho as a Disciple Preparation Center (DPC).<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> Live your best, and let this place change who you are spiritually.<br /><br /> <em>Career Stewardship</em><em><br /></em> A third stewardship you have at BYU-Idaho is your career stewardship. This university has invested millions of dollars in resources that will help you discover and prepare for your career. Do you know where the Internships and Career Services Office is on campus? Can you find those resources online? Have you looked at careers that fit your interests and passion? Once you have selected a career path, are you preparing for it by building and strengthening your r&eacute;sum&eacute;? As you prepare for interviews, are you participating in practice interviews? Do you view your internship as an obligatory activity, or do you see it as a fundamental part of your education? Do you realize that students who have meaningful internships become better students and have more-fulfilling careers?<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn13" title="">[13]</a><a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn13" title=""></a><br /><br /> <em>Life-Skills Stewardship</em><em><br /></em> A fourth stewardship you have as a BYU-Idaho student is your life skills stewardship. At BYU-Idaho, your education is clearly more than just academics. From family skills you will learn in the Eternal Family course and our Student Living program, to personal finance principles we teach in foundations and in the Financial Aid Office, to well-being principles taught in Student Wellness and the Counseling Center, we want you to learn to be a balanced, healthy, well-rounded individual who can manage your time and your life in ways that make you an effective future parent, citizen, and member of the Church. <br /><br /> <em>Leadership Stewardship</em><em><br /></em> A fifth stewardship you have as a BYU-Idaho student is your leadership stewardship. We expect that students of BYU-Idaho will go forth from this university to be leaders in their homes, the Church, and their careers. Now, that doesn't mean you have to be in charge of everything you do. Elder Kim B. Clark described leadership at BYU-Idaho as "leadership with a small 'L,'"<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> and President Henry B. Eyring called this "natural leadership" when he saw the future graduates of BYU-Idaho having lasting impact because of "their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> If you truly understand what we are trying to teach with the BYU-Idaho Learning Model, you will realize that this capacity starts in our classrooms when faculty give students the opportunity to teach and learn from each other. At BYU-Idaho, we also provide thousands of leadership opportunities every semester in student programs, student employment, and in our wards and stakes. Get involved both in your classroom and in other activities, and return your leadership stewardship with increase.<br /><br /> Now, some of you may be saying, "Wow. That's a bit overwhelming, President Gilbert. Five stewardships, like five talents, is a lot of expectation." Well, yes it is. But just get started, pick one area at a time, and work on it each semester. You will make mistakes, and that's okay. Just do your best, and if you do, the Lord will multiply your efforts. <br /><br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Replenishment</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong> There is yet another way you can honor the investment and sacrifice that others at this university make in your behalf: give back and replenish the investment that is being made in you. <br /><br /> To teach this point, I want to describe a pattern from our pioneer heritage. The early pioneers sent vanguard companies ahead of the main exodus west to build campsites along the way and to plant crops for those who would come behind on the trail. I want you to imagine for a moment that you are in one of those pioneer companies that was following behind the vanguard groups. Tired, hungry, and perhaps a little worried about whether or not you are on the right path, you suddenly come into a field or valley your fellow pioneers had previously prepared. You rejoice as you harvest crops that someone before you had planted-vanguard pioneers you had never seen.<br /><br /> Like those pioneers before, you are harvesting crops you did not plant. There were others who came before you and built up this university and this Church in ways that have blessed your lives. They helped lay the foundations that created this university, our student-centered culture, and so much more of what is special about this place. You did not see them, and you may not have known them, but you have felt their sacrifice and sensed their presence. And, like those early pioneers who harvested the crops of those who came before them, you must now decide whether you will reseed these fields for those who will come after you.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn16" title="">[16]</a><a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn16" title=""></a><br /><br /> How can you give back? At some point, we hope you will contribute financially to the university and particularly to those in financial need. But since most of you live on a low-cost budget already, we don't expect that now. What we do expect is that you give back, even during your time as a student, by finding another student in need and reaching out; by lifting someone up academically, emotionally, or spiritually. If you have had a great experience with the resources given to you on this campus, find someone else and share with them. If you had a great leadership position in the Activities program or Get Connected, find someone else you can introduce to the program. If you had a great internship, work with the employer to bring another qualified BYU-Idaho student to the company. That is what we do at BYU-Idaho. That's how we give back. We expect you to find ways to engage, to volunteer, to hold leadership positions, to participate in the Tutoring Center, mentoring program, Activities program, and in so many other wonderful volunteer programs on campus. <br /><br /> <img alt="Get Connected Volunteers " height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Get-Connected_315x225.jpg" width="315" /><br /><br /> Here is a picture of over 350 students who came back to school a week early to volunteer in Get Connected and to give back to the new students entering BYU-Idaho. You will have to pace yourself with prudence so you give back in ways that complement, not compete, with the other stewardships I have discussed; but give back, replenish, and start that pattern now while you are a student.<br /> As I have spoken today, I hope you have felt my love for you. I hope you have felt as if you were one of our youth in Boston and that we love you and are teaching you as if you were one of our own children. <br /><br /> <img alt="Boston boys with families" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Boston-Boys-With-Families_450x200.jpg" width="450" /><br /><br /> Here is a picture of some of those youth from Boston when they came to our inauguration last year. Most of them are or will be graduates of BYU-Idaho. Many of them have been married in the temple and are starting productive careers and beautiful families. Not all of their lives have been perfect or easy, but they are trying to do their best. I hope they all know they are children of promise. I hope all of you know you are children of promise. You have a remarkable future ahead of you. The Lord has given you talents and other resources you can draw on for that future. One of those gifts is this remarkable university. To realize that promise, you will need to become more self-reliant, strengthen your stewardship over the gifts you have received, and be willing to replenish what you have been given both now and in the future.</p>
<p>As you seek to realize these responsibilities, I know the Lord will bless you with added strength and capacity to become who He wants you to become. I so promise in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p>A conversation with my father before my first late night out as a young girl was an experience I won't forget. This is partially because he has told the story over and over throughout my life. It was a poignant moment where a father and his daughter learned from one another.<br /><br />As we parked the car in front of my friend's house that evening, Dad felt anxious to give me some sage advice that would help me stay safe, make good decisions, and be who he always knew I could be. I was so excited for the evening that when the car stopped, I quickly opened the door and jumped out; but before I could close the door behind me, my father tenderly called out a phrase that I'm sure many of you have heard from your parents before. "Christine," he pleaded, "I want you to always remember who you are!" I looked at my father, confused by his earnest and serious statement, and simply replied, "Dad, don't worry! How could I ever forget who I am?" And with that, I slammed the door and went running into my friend's house. <br /><br />As I've reflected upon the declaration I made to my father that night, I have wondered, how did I have so much confidence? Do I still have that same childlike conviction today? <em>Do I know who I really am?</em><em><br /></em><em><br /></em> As we grow in the gospel, we are reminded over and over of our divine nature. As Primary children, we sing the song "I Am a Child of God."<a href="/devotionals/sister-christine-c-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> The Young Women theme is repeated weekly, declaring, "<em>We are daughters of our Heavenly Father, who loves us, and we love Him!</em>"<a href="/devotionals/sister-christine-c-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> As missionaries, many of you were sent all around the earth to teach investigators that they are children of a loving Heavenly Father. Hopefully, by the time we sit here today, the truth that we are children of God has sunk deep into our hearts. So what is it that causes us to sometimes question, doubt, or even forget who we are? <br /><br />Just this past summer, my heart ached as I saw some of those I love doubt aspects of the Church they once believed. What changed in their hearts? How have they forgotten the testimony-building experiences we had together in our youth?<br /><br /> Elder Hallstrom taught us in the last general conference, "We live in a world that can cause us to forget who we really are. The more distractions that surround us, the easier it is to treat casually, then ignore, and then forget our connection with God."<a href="/devotionals/sister-christine-c-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> Distractions can lead to casual actions and then to ignoring our identity and ultimately to forgetting who we are.<br /><br />As our older children go off to school, I get to spend each day with our three-year-old daughter, Claire. As I take her on errands, I always reach out my hand and ask Claire to hold on tight as we navigate through busy parking lots. Claire's response to me lately has been, "I got this, Mom! I don't need your help. I want to do it myself." Each time she makes this statement, I think, how many times do we figuratively say something similar to our Heavenly Father? "I got this! I don't need help. I know who I am." I notice if Claire is willing to hold on to my hand, we can stay together and make it safely to our destination. Similarly, we must hold on to our Heavenly Father and trust in His wisdom and knowledge rather than trying to do things on our own.<br /><br /> Sister Rosemary Wixom has said, "Because you are His child, He knows who you can become. He knows your fears and your dreams. He relishes your potential. He waits for you to come to Him in prayer. Because you are His child, you not only need Him, but He also needs you. Those sitting around you right now in this meeting need you. The world needs you, and your divine nature allows you to be His trusted disciple to all His children."<a href="/devotionals/sister-christine-c-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn4" title="">[4]</a><a href="/devotionals/sister-christine-c-gilbert-fall-2016#_edn4" title=""></a><br /><br /> As BYU-Idaho students, we know that you come from a wide variety of life experiences and circumstances. We also know that you will face moments in life where distraction or independence might lead to difficulty in recognizing who you really are. When these moments arise, don't give up! Hold on to the things that you do know. <em>You are a child of God! </em>Look around and gain strength from prayer, scriptures, the temple, and righteous examples. Use the power of the Atonement to heal, repent, forgive, and remember whose child you are.<br /><br /> In his message today, I hope you will listen carefully to President Gilbert as he speaks about <em>your</em> potential as BYU-Idaho students and as children of God. I have a firm testimony that Heavenly Father loves us! We are His children! He wants us to be safe, make good decisions, and reach our God-given potential. May we hold on to Him so we can declare to our Father in sincere confidence, "I know who I really am."<br /><br /> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is a privilege for me to be invited to speak at a BYU-Idaho devotional. I have been on this campus before when my husband was invited to speak. I felt then, and I feel now, that this is a special place where the Spirit of the Lord can be felt in abundance. You, who are studying and working here, have prepared and qualified yourselves to attend this university. You are here by divine design. In making the decision to attend this school, you sought to follow the promptings of the Spirit. It is not a coincidence that you are here at this time to "seek learning, . . . by study and also by faith."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> <br /><br /> The education you receive will magnify you to be an influence for good wherever life may lead you. It will enable you to provide economically for yourselves, for your families, and for the relief of the poor both temporally and spiritually--a work which will bless you with a remission of your sins.<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn2" title="">[2]</a><a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn2" title=""></a> <br /><br /> President Joseph F. Smith taught, "He [or she] that hath the privilege of learning and embracing the knowledge of God, and the way of life . . . is more fortunate than the finder of wealth, or of the hidden treasures of the earth. . . . His mind is free to accept the plain and precious truths revealed for the redemption and the life of man from the fountain head, and his heart is--or should be--wholly devoted to the great and glorious cause of human redemption."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn3" title="">[3]</a><a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn3" title=""></a> <br /><br /> Your education is a means to help you prepare to return to the presence of God, to become like Him, and to inherit all the glorious blessings He has promised His beloved sons and daughters who are true and faithful. You are here to achieve academically and spiritually to prepare yourselves for greater opportunities, to face the challenges that lie ahead of you, and most importantly, to fulfill your divinely instituted roles in your homes and families. President Smith also taught, "To the Latter-day Saints, salvation itself, under the atonement of Christ, is a process of education... Knowledge is a means of eternal progress."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />Essential to your eternal progression is your willingness to establish homes here in mortality that will go on into the eternities. The Lord has commanded His people, "Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> The Lord is talking about a blueprint for temples. But what could be more significant to your happiness in this life and your eternal well-being than to establish a house built according to the pattern the Lord has set for His own house? Your educational experience will be priceless if it increases your ability to establish a home that will be a sacred place; a home that will be a bit of heaven on earth; a home that will reflect the covenants you have made with God, at baptism, in the ordinance of the sacrament, and in His holy temple. I testify that by continually seeking the Spirit of the Lord, you may move forward with faith and successfully establish such a home.&nbsp; He will show you the way, and you may expect miracles.&nbsp; <br /><br /> As I look out over this beautiful audience of students, my heart swells with joy and excitement for you because I see in you the promise of thousands of temple marriages, faithful homes, and eternal families. Some of you may already have begun your families. Others of you may just be trying to get the courage to speak to someone who has attracted your attention. But all of you are among the faithful who are called upon to organize yourselves, prepare every needful thing, and establish homes where prayer, fasting, faith, learning, glory, and order are a reality--homes that truly become houses of God. You have left home, some of you for the first time. You have a fresh opportunity to begin now. <br /><br /> <strong></strong><strong>Organize Yourselves </strong><strong><br /></strong> According to the Father's plan, we are organized in families. All of you are "beloved spirit son[s] and daughter[s] of heavenly parents... Gender is an essential characteristic of [your] individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a>&nbsp; God instituted laws whereby His spirit children could advance and become like Him.<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> &nbsp;"Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God [and] the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> You learned your first lessons in the premortal world,<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> lessons of faith and good works.<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br /> God gave you agency. You chose to follow His plan, accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, and come to earth--even if it meant facing fears; anxieties; emotional, social, and physical sicknesses, weaknesses, and deficiencies. You agreed to deal with difficult circumstances that could derail your determination, deceptive messages that could challenge your faith, and temptations that block eternal progression. And yet when the Savior laid the foundations of the earth under the direction of His Father--the place where we would dwell, obtain a physical body, and gain experience--you and "all the sons [and daughters] of God shouted for joy."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn11" title="">[11]</a><a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn11" title=""></a> <br /><br /> God's order for families continues in mortality, beginning with Adam and Eve.&nbsp; "God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and...said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> "God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a>&nbsp; "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a>&nbsp; Marriage is God's plan--the plan by which we organize ourselves if we are to truly become like Him.&nbsp; <br /><br /> Elder Bruce R. McConkie taught, "When we as Latter-day Saints talk about marriage we are talking about a holy celestial order. We are talking about a system out of which can grow the greatest love, joy, peace, happiness, and serenity known to humankind. We are talking about creating a family unit that has the potential of being everlasting and eternal, a family unit where a man and a wife can go on in that relationship to all eternity, and where mother and daughter and father and son are bound by eternal ties that will never be severed. We are talking about creating a unit more important than the Church, more important than any organization that exists on earth or in heaven, a unit out of which exaltation and eternal life grow; and when we talk about eternal life, we are talking about the kind of life that God our Heavenly Father lives."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn15" title="">[15]</a><a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn15" title=""></a> <br /><br /> As you organize your lives according to the Father's plan, you keep the Savior and His gospel at the center of your lives. You walk with faith in Jesus Christ and the power of His Atonement to help you repent, change, and overcome your challenges. You keep the covenants you made in sacred priesthood ordinances, and you live worthy of the Holy Ghost. You organize yourselves to receive eternal blessings. <br /><br /><strong>Prepare Every Needful Thing</strong><strong></strong><strong><br /></strong> To prepare the most needful things, we prioritize that which is of greatest importance. This season of your lives is a time to actively develop wholesome, healthy friendships. It is a time to date, to court, and to marry in the temple. <br /><br /> Consider how some of the Lord's instructions to His people apply to relationships. "Therefore, cease from all your light speeches, from [excess of] laughter, from all your lustful desires, from all your pride and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked doings... See that ye love one another; cease to be covetous... Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful... Clothe yourselves with the bond of charity... Pray always."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn16" title="">[16]</a><a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn16" title=""></a> <br /><br /> The Father's promise for eternal life also applies to relationships. "Press forward [along the path of ordinances and covenants] with steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men, ... feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br /> We cannot allow ourselves to be so enamored with the allure of the things of the world, material possessions, images of worldly perfection, or the attractions of sin and immorality that our hearts turn away from Jesus Christ and that carnality and lust consume our ability to love others. We bridle our passions that we may be filled with love.<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> We do not trust worldly philosophies over the commandments of God. <br /><br /> If you feel you are not prepared or worthy for a temple marriage, you can change. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of repentance. Be true to your sacred covenants. Remember that you bear the name of Jesus Christ. Keep God's commandments and remember Him always. Learn to be Christlike, and set an example of faith and good works. Follow His example of loving-kindness, humility, and service to others. Look to the temple, and always be worthy of a temple recommend. And when you make a mistake, repent quickly! <br /><br />When I was growing up, my home life was difficult; and when I was a teenager, my parents were divorced. But I was blessed by the inspired teaching of a faithful and exemplary Laurel teacher. She taught the truths of celestial marriage, temples, and eternal families. As a young single adult, I looked for worthy role models, and I dreamed of the kind of family that I hoped to have one day. I can testify that a happy home is not an outdated impossibility but a reality that can be achieved by a devoted couple who will strive sincerely to live a Christ-centered life, who will keep all their covenants, and who strive to have the Holy Ghost always to be with them. Prepare every needful thing. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Establish a House </strong> <br />Wherever you live--married or single, in an apartment or single family dwelling, rich or poor--you can begin now to put into practice the Lord's temple blueprint in your home and in your heart. <strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Establish a House of Prayer<br /></strong>The prophet Amulek taught that prayer is essential for repentance and for the well-being of homes and families:<strong> </strong>"Exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you... Humble yourselves, and continue in prayer... Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening." He says to cry over crops, fields, and flocks. Your prayers could be over education, assignments, and exams "that ye may prosper."&nbsp; <br /><br />Pray about your relationships. Amulek teaches, "Let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you."&nbsp; But he gives this warning: if you do not act in accordance with your prayers, "your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing... If ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which [is] cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> In other words, pray to find a worthy eternal companion, but then don't sit home playing video games. Be aware of others, create uplifting friendships, serve selflessly, date virtuously, and find true joy. A house of prayer is one in which the pure love of Christ is manifest continually in the welfare and service of others. Establish a house of prayer. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Establish a House of Fasting<br /></strong>Fasting blesses those who are in need and develops spiritual strength in those who observe this sacred law. When you fast in faith and humility, petitioning the Lord, you witness miracles. The Lord has promised those who keep the fast, "Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward... And the Lord shall guide thee continually."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a>&nbsp; Establish a house of fasting. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Establish a House of Faith </strong> <br />Faith in Jesus Christ is the first principle of the gospel.<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> Faith is a principle of power and of action. By acting with faith in Christ, we can do all things that are necessary to obtain salvation, no matter how difficult the road may seem. We honor the faithful pioneers because they walked with faith in every footstep and endured hardships with the fire of faith burning brightly in their hearts and minds. Our challenges are different. Some of you are pioneers in your families, leading the way for your loved ones to follow. You may be exercising faith in Christ to develop a testimony, to live in accordance with the standards of the Church, or to overcome addictions, abuses, disorders, or illnesses. Some are exercising faith for family members who are struggling. Doing hard things has the power to strengthen our faith when we look to the Savior. By the power of His infinite Atonement we may be forgiven of sin, healed from all pain and sorrow, and enabled to do whatever the Lord may require of us. With faith in Christ we never give up. With faith in Christ all things are possible. Establish a house of faith. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Establish a House of Learning</strong> <br />The place where you reside ought to be a place to learn "of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth,"<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> even when formal education is complete. Gospel learning is essential for the spiritual well-being of every household member. Parents help their children learn to have faith in Christ, to repent, to understand baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost.<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />I have witnessed the power of gospel learning in our home. Reading the scriptures individually and together, especially the Book of Mormon, brings a spirit of peace and protection, love and unity that strengthens relationships, provides direction, and heals wounded souls. Establish a house of learning.&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Establish a House of Glory<br /></strong>A house of glory is where the presence of God may dwell. As newlyweds, our first home was across the street from the Mesa Arizona Temple. By virtue of its proximity, we were blessed by its heavenly power. As daylight turned to darkness, the light of the temple filled our tiny apartment, creating a glorious night-light. When our first baby would waken during the night, I cared for her needs by the glow of that sacred light. For me it became symbolic of the peace, the power, and the protection that fills our hearts and our homes when we seek to establish a house worthy of the glory of the Lord.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You have a temple that sits as a beacon on a hill, continually shining forth the glory of God in holiness. But you do not need to live next door to a temple to enjoy its glory and heavenly power. Be kind and gracious. Seek holiness. Be clean. Repent speedily.<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a> Sanctify yourselves, and be worthy of the power and protection of the Lord's glory. By doing so, He promises, "And the Lord will create upon every dwelling-place... a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory of Zion shall be a defence. And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and a covert from storm and from rain."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> Establish a house of glory. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Establish a House of Order<br /></strong>A house of order is established on priesthood ordinances and the sacred covenants we make in those ordinances.&nbsp;"And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God... In the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a> In such a home is the power to overcome all evil. Walk faithfully, keep your covenants, and the promise is that you will be prepared to see the face of God and live.<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a> Establish a house of order. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Establish a House of God</strong> <br />The Father's plan for His sons and daughters is glorious. The greatest blessings in time and in all eternity are promised to men and women who are prepared, who are worthy, and who marry by proper priesthood authority in holy temples.<strong> </strong>The Lord revealed to Joseph Smith, "Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection... and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths... it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels... to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fullness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever. Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue."<a href="/devotionals/sister-carol-f-mcconkie#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Conclusion&nbsp; </strong> <br />I testify that the Lord will bless you as you sincerely strive to establish your homes and your families after the pattern that the Lord has set. Look to the temple as your guide, and be true and faithful to the covenants you have made. And even if you feel that your life has not gone according to your plan, trust in His promises that the faithful will one day inherit all that the Father has and will stand in glory in the eternities. <br /><br />A young woman who is very precious to me shared her feelings about waiting patiently for promised blessings. She said, "The scriptures, the words of the prophets, and callings in the Church help you become what you look for in a future companion. I have found that as I've focused on preparing myself and serving others, it makes the waiting much easier. Instead of dwelling on what I don't have, I focus on what I am working towards."&nbsp; <strong></strong> <br /><br />Remember that the Lord's commandment is to all His Saints. Organize yourselves, prepare every needful thing, and establish a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.&nbsp; <br /><br />I testify that Heavenly Father knows you. He loves you, and His plan for you is perfect <em>for you</em>. Listen to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Walk with faith in Christ. By the power of His Spirit, you will find true joy and peace in this life and a fulness of joy in the life to come. <br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp;<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I am incredibly humbled to stand before you today. It doesn't seem like that long ago that I was a student listening to devotional. In fact, eight years ago when I had just started dating my wife, we held hands for the first time on a devotional date. So if you came here on a devo date . . . you never know. I can't say that I have a huge amount of life experience--in fact, I will probably look back at this devotional 20 years from now and realize I knew very little. That being said, I have known about this assignment for a long time, and for many months I have thought and prayed about what I might say. I feel like the Lord has placed significant spiritual experiences in my life, and I feel strongly that I am supposed to share some of them with you. I pray that the Spirit will be here to teach us today. I feel that the most essential thing that I can talk about is striving to seek the will of the Lord in all things. <br /><br />One of the most important things you can do to help you seek the will of the Lord is to surround yourself with people who have the same spiritual goals that you do. This includes roommates, friends, and people you date and ultimately marry. I owe so much of everything I am today to my wife, Bethany. She inspires me and helps me want to align myself with the Lord. It is much easier to follow God's will when you have a spouse or others around you that desire the same things you desire. Bethany wants to do only what the Lord wants; that is also my desire. As a result, we are able to help and strengthen each other in our goal of returning to our Heavenly Father as a couple that is sealed together by the priesthood. &nbsp; <br /><br />Everything that happens in this life is an opportunity to become. The gospel of Jesus Christ is about becoming what our Heavenly Father wants us to become. It doesn't matter if we are going through difficult or easy times; we need to take every experience in our lives and seek to <em>become </em>more like our Father in Heaven. Elder Dallin H. Oaks has said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts--what we have <em>done</em>. It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts--what we have <em>become</em>. It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become.<a href="/devotionals/jonathon-lawrence#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Elder Oaks masterfully teaches that the gospel is all about <em>becoming</em>. The point of this life is not to simply get through difficult situations; it is to <em>become</em> more like our Savior Jesus Christ in the process. Sometimes we think that if we can only get through this trial, we will be all right. Instead, we should seek to know what our Heavenly Father desires us to learn and become as a result of that experience. &nbsp; <br /><br />Today I will discuss three main principles that help us seek the will of the Lord. &nbsp; <br /><br />Seeking the will of the Lord:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Prayer<br />2. Atonement<br />3. Prior Assurance &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Prayer</strong> <br />We start understanding what our Heavenly Father wants for us through prayer. Prayer is the opportunity to come to the Father and be mentored and loved. <br /><br />In the Bible Dictionary, under <em>prayer</em>, we read,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God (namely, God is our Father, and we are His children), then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive on our part (Matt. 7:7-11). Many of the so-called difficulties about prayer arise from forgetting this relationship. Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant but that are made conditional on our asking for them.<a href="/devotionals/jonathon-lawrence#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/jonathon-lawrence#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""></a>I used to home teach a couple in our ward that was not very active in the Church. But they <em>did </em>ask if I would give their son (we will call him Adam) a priesthood blessing to help enable him to stop smoking. Adam is a baptized member of the Church who is about 38 years old but has not been active most of his life. I gave him a priesthood blessing, and afterward I talked to him about his interaction with the gospel, and he told me that he didn't believe The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the only true church and that I wasn't going to convince him otherwise. &nbsp; <br /><br />Although it was not my job to convince him, I <em>did</em> tell him I had prayed and asked God if this is His Church, and I had received an answer that it is true. I have felt that confirming witness many times. I also told him that God answers specific questions. Adam told me that he didn't feel like God answered <em>his</em> questions. He explained that he prays but does not get specific direction. He went on to say that a long time ago, he prayed about the Church but didn't feel like he received an answer. I testified of God's love and that He <em>does </em>answer prayers. I went on to explain that it is according to God's timing because He knows what is best for us. I told Adam that we have to be ready to accept the answer that God will give us. I also told Adam I have had <em>many </em>experiences when I prayed desperately for direction and answers but didn't always or even often feel an immediate answer. Adam said, "That's unfortunate, and I won't believe if I can't get my answers when I ask." I challenged him to pray about the Church again, asking a specific question; but, if he was to do so, that he needed to be ready and willing to follow the answer he was given. &nbsp; <br /><br />I came home from that experience to find my wife, Bethany, putting our kids down to sleep. If any of you have ever tried to put kids down to bed, you know the struggle is real, especially when they don't think they are tired. We were having a tough time convincing our two-year-old, Madelyn, to go to sleep. She was obviously very tired, but she wasn't quite ready to give up the fight. As I tried to get her to sleep, Madelyn began to ask for things: first milk, then Mommy. I told her no, but that wasn't what she wanted to hear. Eventually, she got more frustrated and desperate in her pleas: she wanted Grandpa, next Grandma. The more I told her no, the more stubborn she became. Madelyn was not listening. She begged to go for a ride in the car, then she wanted a treat--one thing after another, she cried and begged. &nbsp; <br /><br />As her father, I knew that what she needed was sleep, and <em>that </em>would be the best thing for her, not any of the other things she was asking for. As she got more frustrated, I stopped answering her; she was not listening and only got more upset when I spoke. I lay next to her and stroked her hair until she fell asleep. It didn't take very long. I learned a powerful lesson about prayer that night, and I took away two main points: &nbsp; <br /><br />1. God loves us and hears us.<br />I love Madelyn so much. As I think about that experience, I realize that I had stroked her hair to show her love and stayed by her. I also heard everything she asked for. &nbsp; <br />2. God knows when and how to answer our prayers.<br />He won't answer if we won't listen. I stopped talking to Madelyn; she wasn't rational, and she wasn't listening. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder how often I am like Madelyn in my prayers. God will always show love, but I have to be willing to listen and change what I want to what <em>He</em> wants. He only wants what is best for me. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>2. Atonement<br /></strong>As we align our will with Heavenly Father through prayer, we are able to see the enabling power of the Atonement in our lives. To illustrate this, I made up a simple example that I have entitled "The Parable of the Dishwasher." Let's say you just bought a new dishwasher. It will clean the dirtiest pots, pans, and dishes. But if you don't read the instructions, use soap, or turn on the power, it won't work. You can load dishes in every day, and they will still be dirty. Yes, you are interacting with the dishwasher and even "using" it, but it will be nothing more than a box unless you use the soap and turn on the power to cleanse the dishes. &nbsp; <br /><br />The<em> power </em>of the Savior and His Atonement can heal and cleanse you. There is nothing more freeing than being healed and cleansed. We cannot <em>become</em> what Heavenly Father wants us to become without constantly relying upon and utilizing the Atonement. Are we ever guilty of figuratively putting dirty dishes in the dishwasher and never turning it on? Sometimes we go through the motions and don't really get results. We may feel like we are repenting because we have gone through the steps of repentance. But repentance is a process, and while it does require steps, it is so much more than that. &nbsp; <br /><br />In the Bible Dictionary, we read, "The Greek word of which this is the translation denotes a change of mind, [i.e., ]a fresh view about God, about oneself, and about the world. Since we are born into conditions of mortality, repentance comes to mean a turning of the heart and will to God, and a renunciation of sin to which we are naturally inclined."<a href="/devotionals/jonathon-lawrence#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />I love this explanation of repentance. It essentially means that <em>we</em> need to change. When we repent, we change the way we view the world, the way we think, and the way we act, which allows the Lord to mold us. It is not merely going through a list of steps. To truly repent, we must harness the power of the Atonement. Nothing else has the power to make a lasting change of this kind. Of course the Atonement is not just about changing the way we see something; it has a cleansing effect that can totally eradicate sin and help carry our burdens. As we strive to follow the will of our Heavenly Father, we must apply the Atonement in our lives. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>3. Prior Assurance<br /></strong>Working to become more like our Savior each day through prayer and effective utilization of His Atonement empowers us to obtain blessings and see the hand of God in our lives--one of the blessings that may occur through a principle I will refer to as "prior assurance." I don't know when or why the Lord gives prior assurance to some and not to others. I don't have a formula that if you do these things, you are guaranteed to receive prior assurance. But I do know that if we are willing, the Lord will give us what we need to prepare for. And be ready for any experience. So we should ask in prayer and listen to what God is willing to share with us. I personally think that we experience prior assurance more often than we realize. It is important to be aware of what God is preparing us for. Sometimes He will help us feel something <em>before</em> it happens. The scriptures teach us about how Moses receives prior assurance from God. Moses talks with God, who tells Moses to "behold the world and the ends thereof, and all the children of men" (Moses 1:8). &nbsp; <br /><br />God leaves and Satan enters. Moses immediately feels different when he is tempted and tried by Satan. When things get difficult for Moses, he calls upon God. As he continues to pray, Satan leaves<a href="/devotionals/jonathon-lawrence#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> and Moses hears "a voice, saying: Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty, have chosen thee, and thou shalt be made stronger than many waters; for they shall obey thy command as if thou wert God."<a href="/devotionals/jonathon-lawrence#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> Because Moses called upon God and relied on the Atonement and power of Christ, he was able to overcome Satan and be aligned with our Heavenly Father. &nbsp; <br /><br />Let's fast-forward this story. Moses has led the children of Israel out of Egypt. The Egyptians are in pursuit. The children of Israel reach the Red Sea and panic. They don't see any way out of this situation besides death, either by water or by the Egyptians.<a href="/devotionals/jonathon-lawrence#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> Moses, on the other hand, has had prior assurance from God. As we just learned, he would be "made stronger than many waters; for they shall obey thy command as if thou wert God."<a href="/devotionals/jonathon-lawrence#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> Armed with this knowledge, Moses is able to stand at the edge of the Red Sea and say, "Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord. . . . And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided."<a href="/devotionals/jonathon-lawrence#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Moses had an assurance from the Lord that he would have power over the waters. Do you think Moses ever doubted that thought? Did he ever wonder when, or if, that blessing would be realized? We don't know exactly what his thoughts were from the time he received that assurance to actually seeing the application of the promised blessing. But I can imagine that he may have pondered and wondered about what that promise really meant. &nbsp; <br /><br />Let's go back to the banks of the Red Sea. Moses is standing there and realizes that this is how that prior assurance will be realized. I imagine that he had a subtle spiritual impression that simply and quietly told him to part the sea. In the Doctrine and Covenants, we see the Lord speaking to Oliver Cowdery, who was desiring to translate the Book of Mormon: "Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground."<a href="/devotionals/jonathon-lawrence#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> Moses received a revelation from God that told him in his mind and in his heart. Sometimes I think we complicate what revelation really is. I believe the Lord shared this example with Oliver to make a point: that even magnificent results come from pure and simple revelation. We don't need to have an expectation that God will tell us in a more grandiose way than he talked to Moses. &nbsp; <br /><br />The principle of prior assurance and personal revelation lead me to a story that I feel impressed to share. I want to be very clear that this is a personal story, and just because it happened this way for me and my family does not mean that you will have the same experience. Rather, I hope the principles taught can be helpful to you in your life. &nbsp; <br /><br />When we were engaged to be married, Bethany received a father's blessing. During that blessing, she felt a spiritual impression that she would have twins someday. She shared that experience with me, and I was excited at the thought. We both worked hard to align our wills with the Lord's and make use of the Atonement so that we would be worthy to receive this promised blessing. With our first pregnancy, I would not have been surprised if they said that we were going to have twins. We did not get twins but instead a healthy, beautiful girl: Lila (who is here with us today). Later, when Bethany was pregnant again, we wondered about twins. No twins. This time we had a beautiful, healthy boy: Ezra. During this pregnancy, Bethany started having some health complications. At this point, we were very happy with the family that we had; however, my wife and I knew that we would have twins someday. I couldn't help but wonder when that would be. When we found out we were expecting again, we thought for sure <em>this</em> would be twins. We went to the doctor and expected him to tell us that there were two babies that would come to us. This was not the case, but we did have another beautiful daughter: Madelyn, who taught me that powerful lesson about prayer. With increasingly difficult pregnancies, we wondered when or if these twins would be able to come to our family. In our fourth pregnancy, we thought surely <em>this</em> must be the twins coming. We went to the doctor again, somewhat anxious about what we would find out. As it turns out, we were again blessed with a beautiful baby girl: Sophia. I want to be clear that we were <em>not</em> disappointed in any of our pregnancies when we found out that it was only going to be one baby at a time. We were grateful and had powerful spiritual experiences with each pregnancy that the Lord wanted us to have these children at that specific time. It was very clear, and we did not doubt those experiences. However, my wife and I pondered about the impression about having twins. We talked and prayed many times to see, hear, or understand what the Lord would teach us. Up to this point, we didn't feel anything, except that we were on the Lord's path and were doing what He wanted us to do. &nbsp; <br /><br />In May of last year, Bethany and I attended the Rexburg Temple. We both felt a powerful feeling from God that our family was not complete, and a longing and desire to have more children. We truly felt aligned with God's will, and we were willing to do whatever He wanted us to do. As we pondered and discussed what that meant, we both felt the impression that we should pray for the twins to come. We acted in faith and prayed many times and thought often about that impression. In September of last year, Bethany was pregnant, and we went to our first doctor appointment. As we sat in the office, the ultrasound tech said the heartbeat was good and things looked very normal. After a minute or two, she gasped and said, "I have to tell you something--there are two babies in there." Bethany and I looked at each other with such a feeling of love, comfort, and peace. God had sent us twins. Bethany had a very difficult pregnancy, including being on bedrest for several months. This was a hard time for both of us, but we felt so blessed by the Lord. I won't go into all the details here, but I will<em> </em>say that many miracles occurred as these special spirits came into our family. On a routine doctor visit, we had to go immediately to the hospital to deliver the twins. Of all the close calls and possible problems that could have happened, they came safely. &nbsp; <br /><br />While they did have to spend a few weeks in the hospital, they are very healthy and happy girls. Penelope is shown on the left and Clementine on the right. &nbsp; <br /><br />I don't mean to say that they were healthy because of something we did. That was a tender mercy. Of course it was completely out of our hands. Through the entire pregnancy, birth, and extended hospital stay, it was evident that we were not in control at all. This was what God wanted to happen, and we have learned that if we are willing to align ourselves with His will, then all will be well. That does not mean that everything will be easy, but it will be right. It will be just the right circumstances that our Heavenly Father will allow us to have so we can learn how to become like Him. &nbsp; <br /><br />As you can tell from this photo, Bethany and I have a large family. We had six kids in six years. Having a large and young family has its challenges, to say the least, but Bethany and I have the children we do today because we followed what the Lord wanted us to do. And because we have done that, we are so very happy with the incredible blessings that we have been given. &nbsp; <br /><br />I love this quote because it explains how I feel: "As the heavens are higher than the earth, God's work in your life is bigger than the story you'd like that life to tell. His life is bigger than your plans, goals, or fears. To save your life, you'll have to lay down your stories and, minute by minute, day by day, give your life back to him."<a href="/devotionals/jonathon-lawrence#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, we should always strive to seek the will of the Lord in everything we do by, first, communicating more effectively with our Father in Heaven; second, utilizing the Atonement daily in our lives; and third, paying attention to promptings that God may give us that will prepare us for difficult experiences that have not yet occurred. &nbsp; <br /><br />I close with my testimony, that I know that our Heavenly Father knows us and loves us. He sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to perform the Atonement so we can be clean through Him. I know Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. I know He has restored His Church on the earth today, including the blessings of temples. The temple is the only place where we can make covenants through the priesthood that can enable us to be sealed to our families and live with them eternally with our Heavenly Father. I testify of these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the years, I've enjoyed reading marquee signs outside Christian churches. Sometimes they post messages that are fun or insightful. For example, during a particularly snowy winter, one pastor wrote, "Whoever keeps praying for snow, we're impressed. Now pray for world peace." "Honk if you love Jesus; text while driving if you want to meet Him." Another message said, "I was addicted to the hokey pokey thing, but I turned myself around." Some messages read as if God wrote them: "Keep using my name in vain; I'll make rush hour longer" or "What part of 'thou shalt not' didn't you understand?" One sign said, "Don't make me come down there!"<br /><br /> If you and your roommates had a marquee sign and God wrote to you, what would He say? One thing He's said to me over the years is this: "You know what you want; I know what you need." Elder Richard G. Scott observed that when we ask God in prayer for things we want, it "does not assure that [we] will get what [we] want. It does guarantee that, if worthy, [we] will get what [we] need."<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> <br /><br />Years ago while taking the sacrament with my wife and kids, I lamented about my younger years. My mother, sisters, and I experienced some severe trials in our home because of an addiction my father had to alcohol. There were other trials that came simply because we didn't have the gospel. Those trials affected us for years. That particular day, during the sacrament, I felt somewhat sorry for myself. I wished and wanted that life had been different. In my heart I cried to God, "Why didn't you give us what was good? Why did it have to be so bad?" <br /><br />Now, I didn't doubt in God's love for me or His&nbsp;plan&nbsp;of salvation--the macro plan. I did doubt, however, in the micro plan--the small plan He tailored for me. Do you ever feel that way? If you're like me, you know it's true, what Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught: "Having faith in the Father's&nbsp;macro&nbsp;plan of salvation includes making allowance for His&nbsp;micro&nbsp;plans as well."<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> <br /><br />However, sometimes you, or at least I, need a reminder that God "knoweth all things" and possesses a perfect understanding of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, wants, needs, and desires.<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> <br /><br />As I partook of the sacrament and thought, "Why didn't you give us what was good? Why did it have to be so hard?" I felt something. If I could put into words what I felt, God said it was this: "My son, you want what's good; I want what's best. What I gave&nbsp;was&nbsp;the best." In other words God was saying, "That was part of&nbsp;your&nbsp;plan to give&nbsp;you&nbsp;'experience' and 'be for'&nbsp;your&nbsp;'good.'"<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a>&nbsp;One reason we sometimes struggle to trust that "all things work together for good to them that love God" (Romans 8:28) is because we can't see the end from the beginning. We can only see here and now. God, however, sees past, present, and future all at once. He told Moses, "All things are present with me, for I know them all."<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />"We are looked upon by God as though we were&nbsp;in&nbsp;eternity," Joseph Smith said.<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a>&nbsp;Thus, what may&nbsp;look&nbsp;bad in the present may become something good in the future. For example, in this image you can see this young man push the other young man.</p>
<p><br /><img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional-graphics/2016 Fall/Curtis Castillow/Images/boypushing" height="240" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Picture1_300x240.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />What you can't see is if he pushes to hurt or help. Look at the expression on their faces and their body language. Does he want to hurt or help? Now let me show you the whole picture. Now what do you think? It's a good thing, right? Rather than pushing him to hurt, he's pushing him to help get him beyond the oncoming car.</p>
<p><br /><img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional-graphics/2016 Fall/Curtis Castillow/Images/boypushing" height="240" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Picture2.jpg" width="300" /> &nbsp;<br /><br />One of my students years ago commented on this picture and said, "Brother&nbsp;Castillow, I think it's a bad thing." &nbsp; <br /><br />"Why?" I asked. <br /><br />"Look! His hand went right through his body!" <br /><br />Here's the lesson: to know this was a good thing, you had to see the whole picture, not just part. <br /><br />If you take a snapshot of the life of Joseph who was sold into Egypt, and merely look at his younger years, it looks bad--especially when you consider he was in bondage for about 13 years. But when we pan across Joseph's whole life, we see that God wasn't punishing Joseph; He was preparing Joseph for something better. <br /><br />In Genesis 37 we learn that Joseph traveled to Dothan, the place where his brothers imprisoned him in an empty cistern and sold him to the Midianites. When you read Genesis 37, from the time Joseph arrives into Dothan until he's carried to Egypt, God seems to be missing. Timothy Keller observes, "There is no mention of God anywhere here. God never speaks. . . . God seems to be&nbsp;utterly, absolutely, completely absent. . . . Yet He must have been managing down to the [most minute] detail . . . all the awful . . . , all the terrible things, all the things that&nbsp;[seem]<a name="_ednref7"></a>&nbsp;to make no sense."<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> <br /><br />From the outside looking in, Joseph's&nbsp;micro plan seemed like a&nbsp;miserable plan&nbsp;at best. Timothy Keller also observed that when Joseph's brothers threw him into a pit, they stripped him of his coat. The Hebrew word for&nbsp;<em>stripped</em>&nbsp;is <em>pashat</em>. It was a term for "skinning animals."<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> Moses's word choice seems to suggest the act was violent in nature. When Moses said, "They took him, and&nbsp;cast&nbsp;him," (Genesis 37:24) the Hebrew word for <em>cast</em> was&nbsp;<em>shalak</em>.&nbsp;It connotes the idea of throwing something away. If that discarded item is alive, then it infers throwing it to its death. <br /><br />It is the same word used in Exodus 1:22 when Pharaoh commanded the Egyptians to take "every son that is born" and "cast&nbsp;[them] into the river." Years later, as Joseph's brothers reflect on what they did, they give us some insight into Joseph's torment. "[Did we not see] the&nbsp;anguish&nbsp;of his soul, when he&nbsp;besought&nbsp;us, and&nbsp;we would not hear."<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a>&nbsp;Again, during this torment God seems aloof. <br /><br />Surprisingly, hundreds of years later, in this same spot, Dothan, Elisha cries to the Lord for help because he's surrounded by the Syrian army. And in an instant the mountainside blazes with a host of angels, horses, and chariots from heaven. Remember that story? Then Elisha exclaims, "They that be with us are more than they that be with them."<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>&nbsp;Elisha cries from Dothan, angels deliver him. Joseph cries from Dothan, he's flung into a pit. God's seeming silence, however, is neither&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;of&nbsp;His&nbsp;absence nor of His lack of care. God cared as much for Joseph by hiding His glory and power just as much as He cared for Elisha by displaying it. &nbsp; <br />Yet I'm sure there were moments when Joseph thought that was a strange way for God to show His care. Perhaps he thought, "God, I just want to go home and be a shepherd." But God wanted Joseph to be more than a shepherd; He wanted him to be a viceroy--a ruler over Egypt. But even more than a shepherd or a viceroy, God wanted him to be a savior. Joseph would later tell his brothers, "God sent me before you to preserve you . . . and to save [you]. . . . It was not you that sent me hither, but God. . . . Ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good."<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> <br /><br />Not only did God turn his brothers' evil into Joseph's good, but He was also "with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. . . . And Joseph found grace in his sight. . . . And [God]&nbsp;shewed&nbsp;him mercy, and gave him favour."<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a>&nbsp;Here's the lesson: even during the crucible of our lives, we can trust that God is aware of us. He is with us, and He will bless us. For "God does nothing by chance,"&nbsp;said President Spencer W. Kimball, but always by design as a loving father. . . . "It is said that the very hairs of your head are all numbered; is it not to teach us that nothing, not the smallest things imaginable, happen to us by chance? But if the smallest things we can conceive . . . are declared to be under the divine direction . . . [then certainly] the greatest things of life, such as the manner of our coming into the world, our parents, the time, and other circumstances of our birth and condition, are all according to the eternal purposes, direction, and appointments of divine Providence?"<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> <br /><br />I know this is true. When I attended college, like you, I was having one of those "bad hair" weeks. It was a Lemony Snicket, <em>Series of Unfortunate Events</em> moment in my life. The events weren't major problems or setbacks like Joseph's, but they seemed major at the time. While attending BYU in Provo, I worked with the BYU Student Association (BYUSA) and applied to be one of the vice presidents, but the selection committee chose someone else. I walked home from campus discouraged but thought, "That's okay; I applied to be an EFY counselor." As I walked in the door to my apartment, I saw on the kitchen table a letter from EFY. I tore it open with eagerness. My heart pounded with excitement. However, the excitement quickly turned to sadness as I read the part that said my request was declined. <br /><br />Now, this was the same time period that I called a girl named Myra Mains to set up a blind date. I got her phone number from the girl I home taught. The girl I home taught asked me what I perceived as the perfect girl to marry. After I described this "perfect" girl, she replied, "No way; I totally have the girl for you." She then described this friend of hers. The description almost matched perfectly the description I gave. This was truly a match made in heaven. "Wow!" I thought.&nbsp;This&nbsp;was&nbsp;my dream girl. What I didn't know was that I was about to be duped. <br /><br />She gave me the girl's phone number, and I called the next day. I was surprised, however, when on the other end of the line I heard, "Berg Mortuary." <br /><br />Confused, I said, "Uh, I'm looking for someone who apparently works there. Is Myra Mains there?" There was silence on the other end of the line. "Excuse me, is Myra Mains there?" <br /><br />"Sir, is this some kind of a joke?" <br /><br />"No, this is the number I was given. I was careful to dial it correctly. So Myra Mains isn't there?"&nbsp; <br /><br />She was silent again, then chuckled, "Sir, you don't get it, do you?" And you know what, I didn't. I know what you're thinking: "He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer." (Believe me, no one is more aware of that&nbsp;then&nbsp;I.) <br /><br />"Sir," she said, "think about it!"&nbsp;Then she said slowly, "This is a mortuary, sir. 'Is my remains there?' Do you get it now?" <br /><br />Humbled and embarrassed, I said, "Yeah, I get it." <br /><br />Well, this is the kind of week I was having when I came home and opened that EFY letter. After I set the letter down, I saw a hand mirror sitting on the table. I could tell by the opened package next to it, it was something my roommate&nbsp;Miglosh&nbsp;ordered through the mail. He would order lots of things. It seemed odd he would order a hand mirror. Intrigued, I picked up the mirror. (Remember, I feel like I'm at the bottom of the food chain.) No sooner than I caught my reflection in the mirror, it started laughing at me. Seriously! It was one of those gag mirrors with a built-in speaker that projected an obnoxious cackle right about the time you picked it up and saw your reflection. <br /><br />My misfortunes, my defeats pale in comparison to Joseph's. But that is part of the point in sharing them with you. They are the everyday, garden-variety type of week you've no doubt experienced too. Your roommates probably didn't throw you into an empty cistern like Joseph (maybe they threw you in the snow), but you do experience misfortunes and mishaps. I suspect none of you has fallen for the "Myra Mains" gag, but I suspect many of you have fallen in love only to have it end. You've had health issues, family problems, financial difficulties, dropped majors, changed majors, and major problems of every kind. You've been turned down, turned out, and turned away. You didn't get what you wanted. I promise, though, with God you will get what you need. And it may just be that what God knew you needed was something in the end you wanted. I wasn't happy that God gave me what I apparently needed. In the end, though, I discovered that what I needed was actually something I wanted. <br /><br />When those doors I mentioned closed in my life, other doors opened. One door that opened led me to become a seminary teacher for the Church Education System. It was an occupation that was ideal for my personality and family, and eventually it would bring me here to BYU-Idaho to teach in the religion department--a move I consider the greatest blessing of my career. And what if Myra Mains were a real girl? What if I had married her? She wouldn't have been Heather Sampson, the woman I did marry, the woman I love. And I wouldn't have my children: Curt; Carli; the twins, Brigham and Brynn; and Cutler.<br /><img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional-graphics/2016 Fall/Curtis Castillow/Images/boypushing" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Picture3.jpg" width="200" /> <img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional-graphics/2016 Fall/Curtis Castillow/Images/boypushing" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Picture4.jpg" /> &nbsp;<br /><br />After all&nbsp;that's been said, I think it's essential to remember that the Lord doesn't give or allow things that will hurt you in eternity; He gives you things that will help. We need to be careful that what He gives to help we don't interpret as something that hurts. "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. . . . What man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he&nbsp;ask&nbsp;a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?"<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> <br /><br />If a son asks for bread or fish--something he needs--would a loving parent give him a stone or serpent? No! A stone is worthless; a serpent is harmful. God doesn't give things that are worthless or harmful. He gives things that are needful and helpful. So ask, seek, and knock. Be&nbsp;careful,&nbsp;though, that when God offers you bread or fish, you don't view it as a stone or serpent. S. Michael Wilcox observed that sometimes it's easy to judge the bread that God gives as "stones" or "serpents." I say, "Lord, I want bread; I want what's good." The Lord would respond, "Do you want me to give you what you want or what you need?" George MacDonald, a man who inspired C. S. Lewis, said, "Man finds it hard to get what he wants, because he does not want the best; God finds it hard to give, because He would give the best, and man will not take it."<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> <br /><br />In the <em>Ensign</em> there is a story about a young man named Christopher, who was grateful he didn't turn bread into stone or serpents. When he tore open his mission call, his heart dropped when he read the line "Michigan Lansing Mission." He had waited his whole life for that moment. He took German and Spanish in high school because he had dreamed of a foreign mission--walking the cobbled streets of Europe or hiking remote mountain pueblos in South America. What he got, however, was Michigan. Did you ever have something like that happen to you--you figuratively wanted Argentina, but what you got was Michigan? Christopher could have regarded that call as a stone, a serpent, but instead he saw it as bread. He accepted the call the Lord gave and served an honorable mission. <br /><br />More than 20 years after his return, his neighbor invited him to take a DNA test. "I had been adopted and had no idea of my biological ancestry," said Christopher. He was curious about his biological parents but was content with his life. He had a family he loved. Then the results came back. It was a "close family" match. It predicted with 99 percent that they found a close family member. <br /><br />"Before I knew what was happening," said Christopher, <br /><br />[my wife composed] an email to send to this "close family" match. <br /><br />Within minutes an email came back. How old was I? Where was I born? . . . <br /><br />It turned out the "close family" match was my half brother. The person sending the emails was my birth mother. . . . [S]he wanted me to call her. <br /><br />The next morning I dialed her number. As we talked, she told me the story of my birth. <br /><br />Before Christopher hung up, he asked about his biological father. His mother thought Christopher's father was from Lansing, Michigan. Within minutes after the phone call, Christopher found his father on the Internet. He lived in an area close to where Christopher served his mission. Digging further, he discovered his dad had a sister in the same area. He emailed his father, and his father replied that&nbsp;his&nbsp;sister was LDS, and she and her husband were coming to Utah and hoped they could visit with Christopher.<br /><br /><img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional-graphics/2016 Fall/Curtis Castillow/Images/boypushing" height="240" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Picture5.jpg" width="450" /> &nbsp;<br /><br />As they walked in my door, I felt an instant familiarity. Suddenly another light turned on. The man's hair had gone from black to silver, . . . but suddenly I saw in front of me the ward mission leader from the Grand Rapids Ward. . . . I had worked [with him during] a large part of my mission. For months I had been at his home weekly. I had played with his children--my cousins--and been with my aunt and uncle and hadn't known it.<br /><br /><img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional-graphics/2016 Fall/Curtis Castillow/Images/boypushing" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Picture6.jpg" width="425" /> &nbsp;<br /><br />In light of my discovery, I knew&nbsp;<em>why&nbsp;</em>I had been called to serve a mission in Michigan. . . . My biological family was spread all over Michigan in the places where I was called . . . to serve. . . . I knew now . . . this was truly a call by inspiration specifically for me.<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> <br /><br />In the same way, that mission call was a part of Christopher's micro plan, and Joseph's slavery was part of his plan, our experiences are part of our plans. Why God tailors some experiences for us may not be clear now. Thus, we may have to be patient because "all things must come to pass in&nbsp;their&nbsp;time"--even understanding.<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a>&nbsp;However, with the Savior's help we can learn to not only say, "Thy will be done[, Lord]," but patiently also, "Thy timing be done."<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> <br /><br />Although I know that, I forget sometimes--especially when I don't get what I want or what I think I need. In those moments, I need to remember what the Garden of Eden taught Eve. God said,&nbsp; <br /><br />Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, <br /><br />But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it.<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />I suspect there was an infinite number of trees in that garden. Since it was before the Fall, I suspect most of trees and plant life were edible. You could probably have nibbled the bark and gobbled the leaves. With my childlike mind, I imagine a kind of Willy Wonka, chocolate-factory Garden of Eden--complete with edible mushrooms, gummy bear fruit, and rivers of chocolate. I know my imagination is not doctrinally correct, but I suspect there were many trees and shrubs that bore delicacies. That being the case, it's interesting to note what Satan tempted Eve to focus upon: all the things she could have, or the one thing she couldn't. Right? The thing she couldn't have! Satan applies the same tactic to us. <br /><br />As I partook of the sacrament on that day years ago, rather than look at all the good things in my childhood that I did have, I looked upon the good things I didn't have. I overlooked all the goodness, love, and sacrifice&nbsp;my mom, Barbara, gave me and how she taught me to believe in God.<br /><br /> &nbsp;<img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional-graphics/2016 Fall/Curtis Castillow/Images/boypushing" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Picture7.jpg" width="240" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />That belief would sprout into a desire to know God when I was about your age. By focusing on the bad, I overlooked all the good in my dad, Curtis. <br /><br /><img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional-graphics/2016 Fall/Curtis Castillow/Images/boypushing" height="345" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Picture8.jpg" width="240" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />He was good with kids, funny, a hard worker, and he loved me. I also overlooked my wonderful sisters, Anna and Beth. They helped me grow up, and loved me even though I was a stinker. To focus on the one figurative "tree," the seeming bad in our lives--whether past or present--blinds us from all that's good, all that God's given, and all He still gives. <br /><br />In conclusion, in light of all that I've said, permit me to share two more church marquee signs I saw recently. One said, "God help me to be the person my dog thinks I am," and the other sign said, "God is the&nbsp;potter,&nbsp;not Harry." God will help you to be not only what your dog thinks you are but what God knows you will be, because He's the potter. But remember, though, we know what we want, but "your Father knoweth what things ye have need," said Jesus.<a href="/devotionals/curtis-castillow#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a>&nbsp;So if something is shoving you on life's highway, maybe it's shoving you away from harm or toward what's good, better, or best. Remember, God cared for Joseph by hiding His power just as much as He cared for Elisha by displaying it. And even in His seeming absence, He's aware of us, and we can still prosper, like Joseph, and receive grace, mercy, and favor. <br /><br />So ask, seek, and knock in prayer; but remember, you may not get what you want (like a girl named Myra Mains or a job with EFY), but if you stay faithful, you will get what you need--and perhaps find in the end, like me, what you needed you would later discover was also what you wanted. <br /><br />I bear my testimony that God lives, and Jesus is the Christ, and They can manage my life so much better than I can. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Blog Author</p>
<p>Stephanie Nielson is a wife, mother of five children, burn survivor, New York Times bestselling author, globally celebrated blogger, and founder of a public charity called "Beauty Rises."</p>
<p>Sister Nielson was born and raised in Provo, Utah and is most widely known for publishing "nieniedialogues.com," a blog title she created from the last 3 letters of her first name and the first 3 letters of her last name.&nbsp; She was one of the first bloggers on the scene in 2004 when she and her husband, Christian, moved their young family to New Jersey for Christian to begin his career and she wanted to keep family members in the <em>west</em> informed about their life <em>back east</em>.&nbsp; Others outside the family flocked to the little blog about her life as a mother and homemaker, and her readership grew steadily all over the world.&nbsp; The Nielsons later moved to Arizona, and Stephanie continued to share her family life through the blog. When she and her husband were involved in a fiery airplane crash in 2008 in which 80% of her body sustained 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> degree burns, a vast community of blogosphere followers rallied to support her recovery. &nbsp; <br /><br />Sister Nielson has since penned the New York Times bestseller, "Heaven Is Here," her inspiring memoir of hope, triumph, and everyday joy.&nbsp; Her writings and social media messages are a natural portrayal of the everyday activities in her life of being a wife, a stay-at-home-mother, and an active Mormon, and are filled with images that represent Stephanie's joy in these important roles of her life. &nbsp; <br /><br />Although reconstructive surgery is an ongoing requirement for Stephanie, she maintains a joyful attitude for life.&nbsp; There is no doubt that Stephanie's most treasured role is that of "mother."&nbsp; The Nielsons live in Provo with their 5 children: Claire, Jane, Oliver, Nicholas, and Charlotte. <br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology">Greek mythology</a>, a phoenix is a long-lived <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird">bird</a> that is regenerated, or reborn. The phoenix is often associated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">sun</a> and obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor. According to some sources, the phoenix, in a dramatic show of flames and combustion, dies and simply decomposes before being born again. The phoenix symbolizes renewal in general, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">sun</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time">time</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecration">consecration</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection">resurrection</a>, life in heavenly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise">paradise</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ">Christ</a>. But, also, let me add a few of my own observations about this majestic bird. I would add <em>bravery</em> and <em>survivor</em> to its description too.<br /><br /> Coincidentally, I was in a coma, lying in a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, where I was being treated for full-thickness third- and fourth-degree burns over 80 percent of my body in one of the biggest burn centers in the country. In the next room, my husband, Christian, also lay in a coma with burns over nearly 40 percent of his body. We both struggled to live and heal. <br /><br />We had been in an airplane crash, and on impact the airplane had burst into flames, and we had been trapped. Because of the violent impact, Christian, our pilot and dear friend Doug, and I had all been knocked unconscious and lay burning to death inside the cockpit. Doug passed away 24 hours after the accident. <br /><br />When I was nine years old, my oldest sister had her first baby, and it changed my life.&nbsp; Babies were incredible! I knew in that moment that all I wanted to do, forever and ever, was have babies. Lots and lots of babies. <br /><br />Then when I was 18, I met a boy.&nbsp; We met at my dad's office one spring morning.&nbsp; I was filling in for the regular secretary, who happened to be sick that day.&nbsp; It was a day I will never forget, a day that changed my life forever.&nbsp; I was very shy (and I should say I had a missionary), but I felt something change inside me. This boy was beautiful, and upon our first meet something completely unexpected happened.&nbsp; A feeling came over me like electric waves pulsing through my body.&nbsp; It was trumpets sounding and angels singing, as if a real-life Cupid's arrow had struck my heart. I'd never felt anything as powerful and specific in my life. <br /><br />I had been taught, and believed, that heavenly help would guide my life. I often prayed for answers or assistance, and trusted that God would deliver the guidance I needed, especially for something as important as marriage.&nbsp; So while I was a little surprised at the content of the message, I wasn't surprised to receive it. <br /><br />Christian and I were married months later, in December, and welcomed our first child, our daughter Claire, in October just two months shy of our first wedding anniversary. <br /><br />For that first-year milestone, Christian gifted me with an old, rickety rocking chair that he had found at D.I. That chair has followed us to every house in every state we've lived in. <br /><br />Christian had nearly a year left at BYU and Claire had just turned seven months when I found out I was pregnant again.&nbsp; My pregnancies were proving harder than I imagined. I was deathly ill, and the puppy I gave to Christian for his birthday wasn't helping the situation at all. If I didn't love Christian so much, I probably would have killed the dog long ago. <br /><br />We welcomed our second daughter, Jane, just 16 months after Claire was born. Christian was busy, and I didn't see him much because if he wasn't in class or studying at the lab, he was at work. <br /><br />After graduation, we made an epic move across the country to New Jersey.&nbsp; Our new normals included extreme homesickness and stress. <br /><br />One afternoon, while our girls napped, Christian and I sat down together at our kitchen table with our scriptures.&nbsp; Together we studied D&amp;C 59.&nbsp; This particular chapter is about the Saints being blessed for keeping the commandments and striving to the end--even in trials and hardships. "Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are they who have come up unto this land with an eye single to my glory, according to my commandments. . . . Yea, blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who have obeyed my gospel; for they shall receive for their reward the good things of the earth, and it shall bring forth in its strength."<a href="/devotionals/stephanie-nielson#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> <br /><br />It seemed to really ring true for us at the time.&nbsp; Reading those scriptures led us deeper in our study, and we found the beautiful hymn "As Now We Take the Sacrament" by Lee Tom Perry. <br /><br />We read out loud together this particular part: "For courage to accept thy will, / To listen and obey. / We love thee, Lord; our hearts are full. / We'll walk thy chosen way."<a href="/devotionals/stephanie-nielson#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> <br /><br />For me, a very young mother far from home, and Christian, a very young father with the weight of his responsibilities as protector and provider on his shoulders, we knew together that as long as we had the gospel and each other, and we followed God's plan, we would be okay because we did love the Lord.&nbsp; And with God, all things are possible.&nbsp; That hymn has offered peace and comfort many, many times since. <br /><br />Christian and I had been married just 7&frac12; years when our lives changed in a massive way.&nbsp; At the time, we were living in Arizona. Our oldest daughter, Claire, was just six; Jane was five. We added two sons to our family: Oliver and Nicholas, just 3 years old and 18 months. <br /><br />On a hot August afternoon, after a lovely day at the family ranch in New Mexico, we crashed in a small airplane after takeoff. <br /><br />Minutes before we gassed up the airplane to go home, I called my mother-in-law to tell her to tell the children that we would be home in about an hour. Minutes later, I woke up panicking in the back of our small airplane, and on fire. Screaming in pain, I couldn't believe this was really happening to me. I realized quickly, after several unsuccessful attempts trying to get out of the burning airplane, that there was no way I was going to make it out alive; and I knew if I just endured this horrid pain, it would eventually take me and the pain would be gone, but I would be dead. Then I thought about my four children, and somehow I found a way to get up and get out. Then I found the strength to roll and roll, extinguishing the flames off my body. <br /><br />After I rolled for what seemed like hours, I landed in the yard of a home. I was exhausted and in shock. <br /><br />I waited for help, and it came.&nbsp; The first of many miracles happened when our airplane happened to have crashed on the bishop's front lawn.&nbsp; I lay on my back, looking up at strangers who assisted me and helped comfort and calm me, and the bishop administered a priesthood blessing.&nbsp; All I could think about was how badly I needed someone to help me up so I could get home.&nbsp; My kids were so excited because I had planned to make our family's favorite dinner that night: pizza. On my kitchen counter at home sat the dough rising. I had a yoga class to teach later, and I needed to finish preparing my lesson for Young Women. I just needed to get home. <br /><br />The airplane roared and crackled as fire engulfed it and a woodpile we happened to have crashed next to. We also crashed just yards away from a large propane tank. I was so frightened, and I remember frantically looking for Christian. Soon ambulances arrived and put us all three in different helicopters, and they flew us to the Phoenix, Arizona, burn center, where I was put in a medically induced coma for nearly four months. <br /><br />During that time, our families were being counseled by the burn surgeons and hospital therapists to prepare for troubling times--if I actually was to live. At that time, it looked dismal at best. They also told my family I would most likely not have legs, fingers, ears, lips, and a nose. My quality of life would be painful and difficult. <br /><br />They explained that, aside from my burn injuries being physically agonizing for me, my appearance had changed so significantly they worried it would be very traumatic for Christian and my children. They went on to explain that this could end our marriage. That may, sadly, be the case in other situations, but not ours. Christian and I built our love and trust on the teachings and example of Jesus Christ. He was and always has been the center of our home, lives, and marriage. We built trust and a family together and married one another's souls with all the love and respect we knew. And we had courage. <br /><br />While I "slept," I missed my daughter Claire's seventh birthday and my son Nicholas's second birthday. <br /><br />When I awoke from my coma, it was November. <br /><br />Days went by--long days of frustrating silence and so many questions. And pain--so much pain. Because I was burned over 80 percent of my body, and because you can only donate your own skin to yourself, doctors took samples of my skin and sent it to a lab in Boston, where they grew my skin in an incubator. This skin is fragile, thin, and lots of times my body rejected it, which caused the doctors to perform critical life-saving surgeries multiple times. Family members desperately wanted to donate their skin to me, like you can donate a kidney or liver, but that doesn't work like that. <br /><br />After my surgeries, I was told to lie carefully and very still. Each day I was in excruciating pain while doctors and nurses changed my bandages twice a day. I still couldn't move on my own. Each day I was discouraged. Each day I became a little more depressed, and my positive feelings I had for motherhood disappeared. <br /><br />I'd lie in bed despondent and fearful, thinking about my life before the accident. <br /><br />Never in a million years did I imagine my life here. This was certainly <em>not</em> part of the plan. <br /><br />After a particular surgery where they graphed new skin around my eyes, doctors had to sew my eyes shut for two weeks while they healed. I felt claustrophobic, and as my world had gone dark, so did my heart. I couldn't keep watch on the clock to mark the slowly passing hours or anchor myself in Christian's eyes for comfort and reassurance. I was scared all the time. <br /><br />All I could do was lie there in the darkness hour after hour, hearing voices around me. I couldn't help but drift to the past, thinking back to my previous life. I walked through our home in my mind, remembering the weight of a basket of folded laundry in my capable hands as I walked past my bright yellow room where my desk, computer, and books sat. I wandered through our kitchen and living room, smiling at the silhouettes I'd made of our family hanging on the wall above the fireplace. <br /><br />A ritual I had always loved was walking through our quiet house after the children were asleep, and before Christian and I went to bed, to lock the front door. The house was still, the kitchen was clean, the toys were put away. With a click of the dead bolt on my front door, the dangers of the world were locked out. I felt safe, and our children were protected. I passed their bedrooms on the way back to mine. They were each sleeping deeply. I would readjust little bodies on beds and cover them with their blankets again. And then I'd crawl into bed with Christian, complete. Nothing could threaten our comfort and happiness when we were safe in our home, our children sleeping soundly at the end of a good day. <br /><br />But how could I protect my children now from the outside world when I was, for all intents and purposes, the living dead? There was no dead bolt big enough to protect us from this, nowhere I could snuggle up and forget about the world around me. That reality weighed in urgently, ugly and unrelenting. <br /><br />My once happy memories became so painful as I lay there.&nbsp; Christian tried to comfort me with thoughts of home. "Soon we'll be home, darling," he said, "sleeping in our own bed. I know it's going to be a while, but I can't wait to ride the motorcycle around the block, sit next to you on our porch swing, take the family on a bike ride." <br /><br />Children are not allowed in the Arizona Burn Center, but I thought about them every day. I wondered where they were, what they were doing. I wondered if they missed me or wanted to see me again, even if they knew I looked so different. I doubted it. <br /><br />The children would send me hand-drawn pictures of us together holding hands in fields of flowers and me cooking with an apron on. The nurses always taped them up near my bed, and I thought they were darling, but I asked the nurses to take them down. I was not that woman anymore. These pictures were of me with pretty white skin and brown freckles, my lips red, with rosy cheeks. Now I wasn't even close to that woman. In fact, I didn't even feel like a woman. I felt like a monster. <br /><br />It had almost been five months since the accident, and I had been away from my children all that time, never seeing them once. In all that time, I hadn't even seen my own reflection either. I had been putting it off, so frightened to see my new face. I knew I looked different, but I was so terrified to actually see and deal with it. <br /><br />One December evening, Christian walked through my door like he always did. This time he had a mirror in his hands. <br /><br />"I know you can do it, Stephanie. Let's do it together," he said, sitting on the edge of my bed. <br /><br />We sat there for hours, and he gently nudged me the whole time. "Okay, okay, I'll do it," I would say, then chicken out right before. <br /><br />Then I decided I needed to do this myself--and alone. Christian kissed my forehead and quietly walked out of my room. After the door shut, I quietly said a prayer: "Please, Heavenly Father, help me. Help me like what I see. Help me be brave. Please bless me to find the old me somewhere." That prayer went straight to heaven, because almost immediately I felt calm and peaceful. <br /><br />I took a deep breath and turned the mirror over. I started at my bandaged chest and worked my way up. My neck looked a lot like the skin on my arms--scarred and blotchy. I kept going. I looked at my chin, then my lips. Could those be my lips? They were huge and looked the way they felt: painful. <br /><br />When I got to my nose, I cried out and put the mirror down. My nose was completely different, smaller and misshapen. I was unrecognizable to myself. My cheeks were blotched with bloody scabs and raised scars, and half of my ear was burned off. <br /><br />My face scared me, and I knew it would scare anyone. I felt like I was wearing a Halloween mask. Panic took me over. How on earth could my children see me like this? I actually considered having my sisters, who were taking care of my children, put me somewhere where my children would never have to see me and deal with my inadequacies. <br /><br />Being a mother was my purpose in life, the source of my fulfillment, and I knew my children would be afraid of me once they saw me. They would reject me. That fact leveled me. I was inconsolable. I wanted to die. "There is no reason to be here. My children won't even love me," I said to myself over and over again.<em></em> <br /><br />Those precious, beautiful children didn't deserve a disfigured, incapable mother. They needed someone strong who could take care of them no matter what. I was lacking in every way. <br /><br />Each morning I would wake up with a deep ache in my heart. I wanted to wipe away the accident and everything that went with it. The nurses knew and had anticipated the big moment when I finally looked at myself in the mirror. They wanted to hear how it went, but I couldn't talk about it. "It was awful. Please don't ask me," I said. "Tell the other nurses too. It was awful." <br /><br />Then I turned to God in prayer. <em>Please help me through this. Please help our children. </em>Then my favorite Primary song popped into my head. <br /><br />"Heavenly Father, are you really there? / And do you hear and answer every child's prayer? / Some say that heaven is far away, / But I feel it close around me as I pray."<em></em> <br /><br />In that dark hospital room, I sang the first lines over and over out loud to myself: "Heavenly Father, are you really there? / And do you hear and answer every child's prayer?" I needed Him so desperately. But the next verse, a parent's answer to the child's questions, comforted me too. <br /><br />"Pray, He is there / Speak, He is listening. / You are His child. / His love now surrounds you."<a href="/devotionals/stephanie-nielson#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> <br /><br />I prayed for hours that morning, pleading with God for understanding and assistance. I had prayed on my own every day, with Christian and with my siblings when they would come to visit or spend the night with me. I was certain our prayers were being heard by our loving Heavenly Father. At times, I distinctly felt embraced by God's love, and the sweet assurance washed over me that everything would be all right. And I realized something. This broken, sad woman was still me, and underneath all these bandages and medicines, I still had all my toes, fingers, ears, a nose, eyes; and I could see, smell, hear; and, best of all, I had my children, and I had my husband who stood strong and immovable by my side defending me and encouraging me on. <br /><br />I was released from the hospital on New Year's Eve and found my world upside down.&nbsp; True, I wasn't in the hospital anymore, but being home with my children who clearly were having a hard time connecting with me was much worse than I had thought. <br /><br />One night I was in the bathroom, staring at myself in the mirror, pondering unanswerable questions. <em>Who is that person in the mirror? Will I ever like the way I look again? Can I love myself if I look this way?</em> <br /><br />I wondered if makeup would help. I hadn't opened my makeup bag for months, but I knew it had been unpacked and put in our bathroom. I found a tube of mascara and with my clumsy hands brushed it on my eyelashes. <br /><br />I had been taught--and thoroughly believed in--my infinite worth as a daughter of God. I knew my value as a person transcended my looks, but that belief was being tested as I looked at my disfigured reflection in the mirror. Mascara didn't help. <br /><br />I stood in front of the mirror crying, dark mascara streaming down my face, and Christian came in and wrapped his arms around me. I closed my eyes and tried to absorb another of his loving speeches. <br /><br />There was a cry from downstairs. Nicholas. We both knew he wanted Christian and not me. If I went down, he'd probably end up crying even louder and wake up Ollie and the girls. But I wanted to be the one to comfort him. Nicholas cried out again, and Christian started toward the stairs. <br /><br />"No, let me try," I said. Maybe tonight would be different. Maybe tonight he would let me soothe his troubled sleep, like I'd always been able to before. <br /><br />Christian helped me down the stairs, and when I got to the boys' room, Nicholas was crying and Ollie was zonked with a Zorro mask and cape still on. "Nicholas, Mommy's here," I said softly, and I lay beside him on the edge of the bed. " I'm here," I crooned, in much the same voice Christian had used to comfort me just a few minutes earlier. Nicholas settled down a little, and I proceeded cautiously, shocked that he was letting me touch him at all. He lay beside me, breathing deep, relaxed breaths. I looked at every detail of his face and his long brown lashes resting against his round cheeks. His chubby hands nestled their way under his cheeks. Even his white-blond hair seemed to be peacefully resting on his smooth, soft forehead. His perfect beauty struck me, and I was filled with love for this little boy, and gratitude that he would let me lie down near him. I had almost missed these precious moments with my children.<em></em> <br /><br />I had a choice: I could go from victim to survivor. But I didn't want to just be a survivor; I wanted to be a thriver. And I knew it was my choice, and I also firmly knew that the only way I could achieve happiness again was through my Savior, Jesus Christ.<em></em> <br /><br />That night I poured out my heart and soul to God. I told him that I wanted my job back again. And I didn't just want to be part of the family; I wanted to be in charge again. I wanted to do everything I did before the accident. I was determined to be present and active. <br /><br />I missed me. I missed my long hair and healthy body. I missed holding my babies, and I missed snuggling up to Christian after a long day. But each day I found success knowing that I was that much closer to getting my apron back on or my fancy heels on for a weekend date. <br /><br />In Alma 37:6, we read that "by small and simple things are great things brought to pass," and "the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes."<a href="/devotionals/stephanie-nielson#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> And I actually believed I was one of His eternal purposes. <br /><br />Faith in God and in His Son, Jesus Christ, is absolutely essential for us to maintain a balanced outlook through times of trial and difficulty. <br /><br />I know what it feels like to look different, and sometimes it's excruciatingly painful. I know what it feels like to feel ugly and worthless. I know all too much about the endless nights of loneliness and frustration, the depressing and devastating feelings that cause despair, pain, and worthlessness. In contrast, I also know what it feels like to be protected and loved. Christian has been my greatest strength and an advocate for me every single day. He cheers me on when I feel like I am defeated.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now to you men, listen up. Be strong and stay clean. Please do not indulge in the filthy grasp of pornography. It is demeaning to the beautiful girls, young and old, who are in your lives and the women you will someday marry. It corrupts your minds and hearts and distorts what a normal loving relationship and marriage is. I mention this because there was a time along our journey where Christian was given the opportunity to indulge in pornography to help him cope and deal with the situation. He recalls how thankful he was that he didn't ever think about even considering that. He had never indulged in pornography before we married, nor was he involved in it as a young man, so it wasn't as hard for him to avoid it when times got hard and the temptation so very easy and accessible. <br /><br />I can't imagine having to compete with pornography when I was in such a delicate place in my life. There was a time after I had seen myself and come to grips with that reality that he would never want me again. I was sure he would have to drag me around as his miserable, sick, repulsive wife. I think recovery for me would have been very different if Christian and I had to climb that hurdle as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />But we didn't have to deal with that, and perhaps when Christian listened to the prophet or his father or his Young Men leaders as a young boy telling him not to look at pornography, he wondered, "Why? Whom would it really hurt?" He probably never would have thought his choices could and would affect him and our marriage in this particular way. I don't publicly thank him enough for being strong, for being my champion and faithful, dedicated husband, and not giving in to something that would have been easy to indulge in. Instead, he showed respect by honoring our temple marriage and the covenants that we made to the Lord and to each other. He respected my body, the women in his life, and God's timing. His good choices have made our healing process less difficult and painful. <br /><br />I know my skin isn't considered beautiful. I know my face is different, and it took me a long time to accept and understand that. But now, I look at how far I have come, and now when I look in the mirror I see a woman of faith, a woman of courage. I see a mother, a daughter, and a wife. In my scars I see strength, I see hope, and I see miracles. I see God. <br /><br />And I am learning to be proud of my scars. <br /><br />Elder Jeffery R. Holland talked to me in his office one day when I lamented to him about how I felt ugly with this skin and all these scars. He told me, "We look for Christ's scars because they are evidence of what He did for us. They'll be the first things He shows us when we see Him again. Your scars tell a story too. They might not make you feel attractive, but they are a witness of a miracle: that God blessed you to live and that you have accomplished very difficult things." <br /><br />I made it through the weeks and months after the crash and through every day since because I have faith in something larger than myself--faith that God has a plan for me. That belief is a source of inner strength that leads me to peace, comfort, and the courage to cope, even when I don't really feel like coping. <br /><br />With so much that was offered me by the doctors, therapists, hospitals, and other places and people, I realized along the way that ultimately nothing they did could make me happy. <br /><br />At first I stubbornly thought that the only thing that would make me happy was for life to look like it did before the accident. But no one could give that to me, and no one else could make me happy. Happiness was my choice, and with the Savior and lots of faith firmly planted in His Atonement, my life could and would be happy and fulfilling again. We must rely on the Savior and His healing power. <br /><br />About five years ago, when the devastating fire damaged the interior of the historic tabernacle in Provo, Utah, everyone was saddened. I felt a personal loss because since I was born 35 years ago, I attended stake conferences, Christmas and Easter programs, symphonies, and graduations there.<br /><br /> <img alt="Provo_Tabernacle_Fire_Trevor_Christensen-0034---Copy.jpg" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Picture1_300x200.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />When, in 2011, President Monson announced that the tabernacle would be transformed and made into a temple, my heart was deeply touched. I could see the Lord's plan all along. <br /><br />Sister Linda S. Reeves, in a general women's session, said, <br /><br />Suddenly we could see what the Lord had always known! He didn't cause the fire, but He allowed the fire to strip away the interior. He saw the tabernacle as a magnificent temple--a permanent home for making sacred, eternal covenants.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><sup></sup></span> <br /><br />The Lord allows us to be tried and tested, sometimes to our maximum capacity. We have seen the lives of loved ones--and maybe our own--figuratively burned to the ground and have wondered why a loving and caring Heavenly Father would allow such things to happen. But He does not leave us in the ashes; He stands with open arms, eagerly inviting us to come to Him. He is building our lives into magnificent temples where His Spirit can dwell eternally.<a href="/devotionals/stephanie-nielson#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> <br /><br />We are all rising from the ashes of something. Your story might not include fire and physical pain, but as you look at the glorious temple, I hope it reminds you of the beautiful transformation that took place. I hope you look at it and admire the beautiful details that make it astonishing both on the inside and outside.<br /><br /> <img alt="ProvoCCTemple-Exterior-west2015.jpg" height="240" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Picture2_300x240.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />The temple for me is a reminder of God's healing powers and so much hope. We were both literally reduced to ashes and born again strong, brave, and courageous, with new wisdom and a different kind beauty. And that is why this temple is so significant to me. I share my story with this temple we honor, and I celebrate its rebirth and glorious renewal. <br /><br />So, you see, the legend of the beautiful phoenix isn't just a story to me; it's my story and your story. If we let the Atonement work in our lives, we can be as a phoenix and rise from pain, despair, grief, tragedy, and heartache. The Son of God makes that possible. The Atonement can lift us up in beauty from our ashes, as Isaiah promises: "beauty for ashes."<a href="/devotionals/stephanie-nielson#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> <br /><br />I testify that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. Because of His atoning sacrifice, we can be washed clean, and as we worthily partake of the sacrament and renew and honor our covenants, our burdens can be lightened and we can repeatedly become purified and strengthened. I testify of these things in the name of our beloved Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

Clark. She is now the executive assistant to President Clark Gilbert.</p>
<p>Born in Riverside, California, Kathy received her associate degree from BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Sister Webb has twice served as a ward young women president. She has also been a teacher in the Relief Society, and a counselor in a ward primary presidency.&nbsp; She currently serves as a counselor in the Rexburg YSA 8<sup>th</sup> Stake Relief Society presidency here on campus.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Kathy and her husband, Jeff, are the parents of 6 children and 12 grandchildren. Kathy loves being with her family and attending the ball games of her grandchildren.&nbsp; She also enjoys traveling and being outdoors, especially in the sun and the water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, it is an amazing experience to stand before you today.&nbsp; The invitation to speak to you is one of which I have worried about, studied for, prayed over, and desired to know how to appropriately respond to.&nbsp; I pray now for the windows of heaven to open that you might hear the things that the Lord would have you hear and that I may say the things He would have me say in a way that would be pleasing to Him and helpful to you.&nbsp; <br /><br /> I love BYU-Idaho!&nbsp; It has changed my life, and I know it can and will change yours, too.&nbsp; I have worked for and with some of the greatest men and women of this generation.&nbsp; You have the opportunity to study and learn from them both through their words and their examples.&nbsp; Indeed, we are a very blessed group!&nbsp; <br /><br />I love to be happy!&nbsp; Don't you?&nbsp; It seems to me that I spend all of my time trying to be happy.&nbsp; In fact, I think all of my choices are centered around my desire to be happy.&nbsp; Two years ago at this very pulpit Elder Jeffrey R. Holland delivered a talk entitled, "Living After the Manner of Happiness."&nbsp; He said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . your best chance for being happy is to do the things that happy people do. &nbsp;Live the way happy people live.&nbsp; Walk the path that happy people walk.&nbsp; And your chances to find joy in unexpected moments, to find peace in unexpected places, to find the help of angels when you didn't even know they knew you existed, improves exponentially.<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a beautiful formula for happiness: "Live the way happy people live.&nbsp; Walk the path that happy people walk."<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />In my life, I have known great times of happiness.&nbsp; One of the greatest joys of my life came just 11 days ago when my youngest son Tanner returned home from his mission to Thailand.&nbsp; Choices can lead us to happiness.&nbsp; I am confident that Tanner's decision to serve a mission will continue to bring him great happiness.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have also known times of sorrow and sadness that came about because of choices that didn't lead to the path of happiness. I have had firsthand experience with some of the consequences of choices that don't lead us toward God, including the associated heartache and despair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><strong><em>Early Life</em></strong></p>
<p>When I was in sixth grade, my family moved to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for my father's work. &nbsp;I was 11 years old, and the country was just coming into its oil money.&nbsp; It was still very much a "third-world" setting; and to a young girl, it was very strange and hot!&nbsp; Although we had lived overseas a few years before that, nothing had prepared me for Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; Ultimately, however, in spite of different customs and a drastically different culture, I had a very good, healthy, and happy childhood in Jeddah.&nbsp; I was strong, knew who I was, had plenty of diversity in my life, and I wasn't afraid or ashamed to be a Mormon even in a country where I did not have one other LDS friend or know another LDS youth! &nbsp;During those early years, there was a time when we were perhaps the only members of the church in Jeddah.<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />I had grown up in the Church, and my mother saw to it that the gospel was the center of the teaching in our home.&nbsp; My father was not active in the Church, so the only opportunity we had to take the sacrament was either when my older brother, who was at boarding school in Germany, was home for a visit or when a member of the Church who sometimes did business in a nearby community would come to Jeddah with his wife.&nbsp; During those visits we would have a sacrament meeting in our home.&nbsp; Those services were so joyful to my mother.&nbsp; I quickly learned that the sacrament was very important, and sacred and that it was a special privilege to have the opportunity to partake of it.&nbsp; My mother's joy taught me and instilled deep in my heart that there was something remarkable in her life and ours about partaking of the sacrament.&nbsp; So early in my life I knew in a very unique way that the gospel was related to our happiness.&nbsp; I knew that I was a child of God. &nbsp;And I knew that my mother knew that Joseph Smith was a prophet, that the Church was true, and that families could be together forever.&nbsp; And I wanted to know that, too. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />My parents were extraordinary people, and my mother was exemplary in her faith and commitment to the Lord.&nbsp; She went to great lengths to make sure we had the gospel in our lives, that we lived in a home of unity and peace, and that we loved one another.&nbsp; She loved my father with all of her heart; and we knew it, and he knew it.&nbsp; <br /><br />My father was also strong and good.&nbsp; He taught us to respect the country and people where we lived, to be honest and live lives of integrity, to work hard, and to take care of ourselves and sacrifice wants for needs.&nbsp; But he did one thing that made all of the difference in our lives in Jeddah--he enabled my mother to bring the gospel into a country where you couldn't declare that you were a Mormon; you couldn't receive through the mail materials focusing on Christ (like Church magazines); and you couldn't gather to worship outside your home.&nbsp; Had my father not been supportive, my mother wouldn't have been able to be such a powerful source for good in our lives. <br /><br />Although my parents were in Jeddah for 22 years, I was there for only four years as I had to leave the country to go away for high school.&nbsp; The Saudis wouldn't let the Americans build a high school in their country.&nbsp; And so my friends and I left our families--most going to boarding schools in Europe or the United States.&nbsp; I was blessed to come to Idaho and live with my aunt and uncle in Idaho Falls.&nbsp; I was 15 years old and terrified, scared, and so terribly sad to be leaving my family.&nbsp; And while I was grateful to be with my aunt and uncle and they were good to me, I had lost my familial identity.&nbsp; I was once again in a new culture, a new place, and feeling very alone.&nbsp; I stayed active in the Church during those years, but when I left high school I didn't know myself as well as I had in Jeddah and it didn't take long before the path I chose was not "living after the manner of happiness."<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Post High School</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>I didn't go straight to college after high school.&nbsp; Instead I went to work, and through that work I ultimately let myself get very distracted by the world and by voices who didn't speak truth and certainly didn't believe and trust in God.&nbsp; In a very short time, I put at risk not only myself but my future family.&nbsp; I put myself in danger of losing my eternal destiny.&nbsp; I had pulled up my anchor from the security of the teachings of my mother and had begun to drop my anchor in the sandy sediment of uncertainty and indecision. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Fortunately, the Lord never left me.&nbsp; He continued to reach out to me and whisper truth to my heart.&nbsp; Ultimately, because of the power of the Savior's love and my parents' constant pleas and faith, many rescues came into my life, ranging from personal spiritual experiences to the Lord sending tender mercies and even angels to assist.&nbsp; <em><br /></em><strong><em><br /></em><em>The Rescue</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>During those years, the Lord repeatedly reached out to rescue me through a pattern of interventions that, over time, saved me.&nbsp; I would like to share a few of the rescues that defined my path.&nbsp; I will then share some of the choices that had to be made in order for the rescues to effectively change my life and move me forward on the path of happiness.</p>
<p>Rescue #1:&nbsp; A New Life <br /><br />The first rescue came with the birth of our oldest daughter.&nbsp; She brought with her the resounding testimony that we are children of God--that she was and is a daughter of God.&nbsp; She was perfect and filled with light, and her life gave my life new meaning and purpose.&nbsp; My heart was instantly changed as I remembered who I was and my desires returned to the teachings of my mother and the gospel of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;Through my daughter I felt the love of the Savior flood my heart and bring new hope.&nbsp; <br /><br />Rescue #2:&nbsp; Time to Move <br /><br />The second rescue came nearly two years later when I removed myself and my daughter from a situation that was not good for either of us.&nbsp; It required physically driving away from Texas in the middle of the night with my little two-year-old.&nbsp; On that drive and through what seemed to be endless tears, I felt the hand of heaven guiding our path and protecting us straight into the arms and security of a loving and supportive family.&nbsp; <br /><br />Rescue #3:&nbsp; Time to Change <br /><br />The third rescue came as I dealt with getting my life back on the path to God. &nbsp;It included repentance, lots and lots of do-overs, and was enabled by the power, mercy, and grace of God.&nbsp; And, again, it was enhanced by my incredible parents and family. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Rescue # 4:&nbsp; Second Chances <br /><br />The fourth rescue came when I met and married my husband, Jeff. &nbsp;We were a very unlikely match, or so I thought, but by the end of our first "blind" date, I felt something in his presence that I had never felt before, and I found myself not wanting to say goodbye.&nbsp; The Lord was with me on that journey; and eight months after we were married, Jeff was baptized a member of the Church.&nbsp; We were sealed in the Los Angeles Temple a year later after he legally adopted our daughter.&nbsp; Today this good man helps me to do things I never dreamed I would have the chance or opportunity to do.&nbsp; I am eternally grateful to him for his sacrifices for our family and for me, for his steadiness and consistency in life, and for his loyalty and devotion to our family and to the Lord.&nbsp; <br /><br />Rescue #5: A Work in Process <br /><br />The fifth rescue is still in process. It is linked to BYU-Idaho for here, at this school, in this special and set apart place, I feel the love of the Lord and the goodness of His grace and mercy every day.&nbsp; I experience firsthand the enabling power of the Atonement as I serve in my current assignment.&nbsp; I literally receive help from Heaven as the Lord brings people and resources into my path to expedite His work and to enable me to do more than I should be able to do.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here at BYU-Idaho all of us have the opportunity to witness the Lord leading the work of this university.&nbsp; We have the opportunity to gather and gain strength from other like-minded people and to be taught by people of faith and belief.&nbsp; We have the opportunity to learn about things secular and things eternal.&nbsp; And we have the opportunity to be in an environment where the Holy Ghost can be felt in every classroom, activity, and home if we will choose to invite Him.&nbsp; We have the opportunity to come to know the Savior and ourselves much more intimately. <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><strong><em>Choices to be made</em></strong> <br /><br />Every time the Lord rescued me, I had to make a choice.&nbsp; The Lord was and is literally standing at the door and knocking, <a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a> but all of us have to choose to open the door and let him in. <br /><br />Following are five choices that I made associated with my pattern of rescues.&nbsp; These are choices that took me back to the teachings of my mother and the reality that I am a child of God.&nbsp; These are also choices I am still making today and invite you to make in your personal rescue as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Choice #1: Remember Who You Are <br /><br />You are in a new time and place in your life. &nbsp;Remember who you are and where you came from.&nbsp; You are literally a child of God.&nbsp; I had to remember who my mother taught me to be, who I already knew I was. <br /><br />Part of this mortal journey is coming to know yourself--your personal likes and dislikes, your gifts and talents, your strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; I believe that BYU-Idaho is one of the best places on the earth to come to know yourself through the courses you study, the activities you participate in, the wards and stakes you serve in, and in how you live your life every day.&nbsp; BYU-Idaho is also a place where you can learn how God talks to you and grow confidant that you are literally His son or daughter and that He has a plan for you and your life.&nbsp; I pray that you will use this time to focus on becoming your best self as you follow in the path of the Savior.&nbsp; Quoting Elder David A. Bednar from this October's general conference:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We come to know the Savior as we do our best to go where He wants us to go, as we strive to say what He wants us to say, and as we become what He wants us to become.<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""></a>Choice #2:&nbsp; Choose to Believe and to Exercise Faith <br /><br />When you choose to believe, you exercise faith.&nbsp; And when you exercise faith, your belief will become knowledge.&nbsp; Elder Holland said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The easiest and the earliest [step of coming unto Christ] comes simply with the desire of our heart, the most basic form of faith that we know.&nbsp; "If ye can no more than desire to believe," . . . that is enough to begin.&nbsp; Just believing, just having a&nbsp; "molecule" of faith . . . that simple step, when focused on the Lord Jesus Christ, has ever been and always will be the first principle of His eternal gospel, the first step out of despair.<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""></a>I love that.&nbsp; Faith is the first step out of despair, and it starts with a desire.&nbsp; <br /><br />Faith also enables us to enjoy the blessings associated with obedience. <br /><br />This past summer I was able to connect with some dear friends, Bruce and Julia Hobbs.&nbsp; They had just returned from serving over the California Rancho Cucamonga Mission.&nbsp; I asked Brother Hobbs what the one thing was that had been the most helpful to him from his previous employment at BYU-Idaho in his service as a mission president.&nbsp; He responded that it was doing what Elder Bednar had taught him.&nbsp; This is how Brother Hobbs described it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When you are invited to act by the Lord's servants, do it. &nbsp;Go forward with faith and act even if you do not understand the reason in that moment. &nbsp;As you submit your will to God and act in accordance with His teachings, He will enlarge your capacities and increase your understanding. &nbsp;You may not fully know the reason why, but as you press ahead with steadfast faith in Christ, the Lord will send peace and reassurance that you are doing His work.<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[viii]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""></a>Acting in faith allows Father in Heaven to teach us powerful lessons that we couldn't learn any other way.&nbsp; When I first felt the Lord reaching out to rescue me, I had to choose to exercise faith to follow Him.&nbsp; I had to choose to believe.&nbsp; I had to be patient with myself and willing to allow the Lord to tutor me.&nbsp; I pray you will choose to believe and exercise faith in all aspects of your life. <br /><br />Choice #3: Choose to Change <br /><br />If you are in a bad place, a place where the light doesn't seem to be shining in your life or if you are feeling despondent or dejected--make a change, move.&nbsp; There are two things I often reflect on that Elder Bednar taught me during his time as president of this university that can help.&nbsp; <br /><br />#1:&nbsp; He drew a line and labeled one side of the line the Lord's side and the other side of the line the Adversary's side.&nbsp; He then taught that we are either on the Lord's side or we are on the Adversary's side.&nbsp; As we turn away from the Adversary and move closer to the Lord, the Adversary comes to have little or no influence on us.<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[ix]</a>&nbsp; And so I say to you today, if you are not on the Lord's side--move.&nbsp; Get up and walk away--make a change.&nbsp; My rescue is a witness that the deeper you go into the Lord's side of the line, the safer and better able to experience happiness you will be.&nbsp; <br /><br />#2: In 1998 Elder Bednar gave a talk on this campus entitled, "In the Path of Their Duty." In that talk he shared a principle that continues to inform my thoughts and actions today.&nbsp; He referenced four phrases from the scriptures: <em>Double minded</em>; <em>Double heart</em>; <em>Divided heart</em>; and <em>Double tongued</em>."<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[x]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />He said: "Each of these . . . describes the problems and consequences associated with saying one thing and doing another--with attempting to serve two masters--with dividing our loyalty and allegiance between God and the world."<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[xi]</a> <br /><br />Are you saying one thing and doing another?&nbsp; Are you attempting to serve two masters?&nbsp; Are you dividing your loyalty and allegiance between God and the world?&nbsp; If so, get up and move--make the change.&nbsp; It is time to turn away from the world and toward the divine nature you inherited from God.&nbsp; It is time to be true to yourself and go further into the Lord's side of the line.&nbsp; <br /><br />Choice #4: Repent and Seek Forgiveness <br /><br />As you make changes in your life, don't be afraid to take that step of faith and repent.&nbsp; Elder Holland said that the word "repent [is] perhaps the most hopeful and encouraging word in the Christian vocabulary."<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[xii]</a>&nbsp; I know firsthand that there is nothing more liberating and freeing than giving your sins and burdens to the Lord.&nbsp; You don't have to feel the despair of poor choices.&nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Dale G. Renlund said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Real repentance must involve faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, faith that He can change us, faith that He can forgive us, and faith that He will help us avoid more mistakes. ... <strong>Without the Redeemer, the inherent hope and joy evaporate, and repentance becomes simply miserable behavior modification</strong>. But by exercising faith in Him, we become converted to His ability and willingness to forgive sin.<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[xiii]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""></a>As you repent, it will be important to remember to forgive yourself.&nbsp; That may be the hardest part.&nbsp; But I can promise you that through true repentance you can become a new person.&nbsp; Through His power and Atonement, you can move on so completely that you will struggle to even remember the details of the life you left behind.&nbsp; <br /><br />An important even vital part of repentance is experienced each week as we partake of the sacrament and renew our covenants with the Lord.&nbsp; As we exercise that sacred privilege, additional strength and protection will come.&nbsp; <br /><br />In this past general conference, President Henry B. Eyring said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Of all the blessings we can count, the greatest by far is the feeling of forgiveness that comes as we partake of the sacrament. We will feel greater love and appreciation for the Savior. ...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The blessing of love we receive will make it easier for us to keep the commandment to "always remember him."<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[xiv]</a></p>
<p>I know today what my mother knew almost 50 years ago in Saudi Arabia--that through the sacrament, power comes into our lives--including His power to cleanse and heal and His "power to do all things"<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[xv]</a> by faith.&nbsp; I hope and pray that you will do all you can to never miss the opportunity to partake of the sacrament.&nbsp; <br /><br />Choice #5:&nbsp; Choose to Be Happy <br /><br />Coming to work at BYU-Idaho is a joyful experience for me every day.&nbsp; I know that from the moment President Gilbert enters the office I am going to feel his energy and excitement for the work of this university and his love for you students and for all those who work here.&nbsp; And I know when I see Sister Gilbert and their children that same energy and enthusiasm is going to be present.&nbsp; I honestly don't think I have never met a happier family than the Gilberts.&nbsp; When you ring their doorbell, you will be greeted by a flood of joy, smiles, and giggles.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Gilberts are not happy because their life is easy, rather they are happy because they choose to be happy.&nbsp; And being around them and watching them has taught me a lot about how they do that.&nbsp; There are three things that I watch the Gilberts do routinely that I offer to you as a mini formula for happiness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">First: follow the Savior.&nbsp; Choosing to be happy means following the Savior.&nbsp; Go where He wants you to go; do what He wants you to do.<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[xvi]</a>&nbsp; The Gilberts have moved their family three times in ten years and in the process let go of friends and other responsibilities to go where the Lord has called them.&nbsp; Let the Savior be your guide, your light, and your example.&nbsp; Follow the Savior. &nbsp; <br /><br />Second: be positive.&nbsp; Choosing to be happy means that when you encounter negative situations, you don't dwell on what you can't do.&nbsp; Look for the possibilities and the things you can do.&nbsp; Every day I watch President Gilbert deal with challenges and hard situations, but he never takes a negative approach.&nbsp; He thinks in terms of seeing the opportunities and creating solutions.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Third: serve others.&nbsp; Choosing to be happy is a choice to serve others.&nbsp; President and Sister Gilbert model this for you and for me every day.&nbsp; They don't say, "We are too busy."&nbsp; Instead they reach out to serve and take time to lift and help others.&nbsp; They are genuine and sincere.&nbsp; They think of and remember the one.</p>
<p>When you choose to be happy, you will see and feel the light within you growing and the right people will be drawn to you--whether it is someone you want to date or marry, someone looking for a good employee, or maybe even someone seeking the gospel.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>The Atonement</strong></p>
<p>To experience the rescue and make the choices I have shared, each of us needs to utilize the power of the Atonement in our lives every day--both to repent and be forgiven and to be enabled to do hard things.&nbsp; The Savior is the perfect role model.&nbsp; His Atonement personifies His love for each of us.&nbsp; The Atonement is the reason for the joy I feel in my life and in my heart.&nbsp; It is what lets me become a new person and sink my anchor into the foundation of the Lord.&nbsp; It is what allows me to be rescued and to enjoy the journey of life.&nbsp; The Atonement is truly the greatest gift ever given to man and to me personally.&nbsp; It is personal, and it is infinite.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Atonement takes ordinary men and women and allows them to do extraordinary things and become worthy in time to enter into the presence of God.&nbsp; It is what gives us strength to go through trials and endure.&nbsp; It is what heals us when we are broken.&nbsp; The Atonement is what allows our minds to stretch and learn when we don't think we can.&nbsp; It is what makes the difference in our lives between darkness and light--what turns our sorrows into joy, our weaknesses into strengths.<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[xvii]</a> <br /><br />The Savior is steady and true and sure.&nbsp; He came and continues to come to my rescue, and He wants to come to your rescue.&nbsp; He is at the door knocking, but we must choose to open the door and let him in.&nbsp; Choose to remember who you are; choose to believe and to exercise faith; choose to change; choose to repent; and choose to be happy. <br /><br />I love my Father in Heaven.&nbsp; I am grateful to Him for His mercy and grace; for His son and His Atonement that blesses my life every day; for a mother who taught me truth and a father that even today continues to believe in me and provides strength and support; and to my wonderful husband and family who are a true source of joy in my life.&nbsp; And I am grateful for the opportunity to be here at BYU-Idaho with you where together we learn truth and how to live after the true manner of happiness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.<a href="/devotionals/kathy-webb#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[xviii]</a></p>

<p>In Matthew, chapter 25, the Savior teaches us key concepts concerning our own discipleship and how we treat other people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: &nbsp; <br /><br />And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: &nbsp; <br /><br />And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. &nbsp; <br /><br />Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: &nbsp; <br /><br />For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: &nbsp; <br /><br />Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. &nbsp; <br /><br />Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? &nbsp; <br /><br />When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? &nbsp; <br /><br />Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? &nbsp; <br /><br />And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. (Matthew 25:31-40)</p>
<p>The Savior gives us six specific ways in which we should serve others--strangers, even--in these verses. Let's consider each of them in turn. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; "For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat"</strong> <br /><br />"For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat." Hunger is part of our human experience and lets us know we need nourishment. According to the World Food Programme, "Some 795&nbsp;million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy, active life. That's about one in nine people on earth" (<a href="http://www.wfp.org">www.wfp.org</a> <em>Hunger Statistics</em>). How can we "give [them] meat"? Fast offerings that we donate to the Church are used to feed the hungry in our wards and communities. There are food banks and other charitable organizations to which we may donate that help alleviate hunger as well. The Boy Scouts of America recently conducted a <em>Scouting for Food</em> drive in the area, in which they collected donated food in order to help stock local food banks. I'm sure you have all had a hungry friend, roommate, or neighbor that you have served at some point in your life. How many times has the Relief Society provided meals for individuals and families in need? How many times have you been the recipient of, or participant in, such service? Bishops, Relief Society presidents, home and visiting teachers all look out for and help serve those in need of food and nourishment. It is difficult to meet others' spiritual needs if their temporal needs are not met. <br /><br />This is physical food. Is there not also spiritual food? The world is full of people that are spiritually hungry. The Old Testament prophet Amos foretold the conditions of our day.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it<em>. </em>(Amos 8:11-12)</p>
<p>How do we help those suffering from this famine of hearing the words of the Lord? Notice that those who suffer from this famine are not just standing idly by. They wander and run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord. They are actively seeking but do not know where to find it. As members of the Church, we have the responsibility to share the word of God with the entire world. Thus we can help alleviate this hunger or famine of hearing the word of God. <br /><br />Jesus said, "I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger" (John 6:35). As we share the gospel and help others come unto Christ, we give them the chance to partake of this bread, the Bread of Life. Through the sacred ordinance of the sacrament, we partake of physical bread--bread that represents Christ's broken body--and thus we can be spiritually filled. <br /><br />We also provide this spiritual nourishment as we share our testimonies with others; teach and participate in Sunday School, priesthood, and Relief Society lessons; and fulfill our duties as home and visiting teachers. <br /><br />"I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat" (Matthew 25:35). &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>2. "I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink" </strong> <br /><br />Next: "I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink" (Matthew 25:35). Having grown up along the banks of the Columbia River in Washington state, I never really acquired a serious appreciation for water--drinking water--until I spent some time in a country where you must not drink the water that comes out of the tap unless you wish to become seriously ill. <br /><br /> <img alt="../../../Volumes/DevotionalGraphics/2016 Fall/Brian Felt/Petersbu" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall 2016/Graphics/Water-Bottles_300x225.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />On the screen you can see three large six-liter bottles of water--yes, water. The bottle in the middle holds the first six liters of water that came out of the tap one day in the apartment where I stayed on a study abroad trip in St. Petersburg, Russia, about 12 years ago. I honestly don't know what exactly made the water so orange, but it was rather disturbing to look at and contemplate drinking. Unseen in this water is a nasty parasite called <em>giardia lamblia</em>, which you really should avoid. The bottle on the left contains the next six liters of water to come out of the tap--slightly less colored. The bottle on the right has clear, pure water and was straight from the store. On the label is written, in rather small letters, <em>pit'evaja voda</em>, or "drinking water." I'm sure you can guess from which bottle we chose to drink. This water was not easy to acquire: It involved carrying these rather heavy bottles about a quarter of a mile from the nearest store that sold them and then sometimes lugging them up the stairs when the elevator in our apartment building didn't work. They were not cheap, either, but the alternative was not appealing. When I returned to St. Petersburg in 2015 to spend two months on a sabbatical leave, I was quite relieved to see a bottled-water dispenser in my host family's kitchen. I had a reliable source of clean drinking water. <br /><br />Acquiring and dispensing potable, or drinkable, water is a rather expensive undertaking in many parts of the world. In fact, water scarcity is rapidly becoming a major issue in more and more countries, including right here in the United States. When was the last time you paid a dollar for a bottle of water? Do you realize that it may be costing you more than gasoline? <br /><br />In a similar way, pure <em>spiritual</em> water is a rather scarce thing in today's world. Just like the orange water we saw in the middle and left bottles in the picture, much of the spiritual water available and promoted by the world today is filthy and spiritually harmful--it's full of spiritual giardia. Would you drink the contaminated water from the middle bottle? I hope not! <br /><br />To what source should we turn to get our own spiritual water? The ultimate source is, of course, the Savior. He taught this beautifully to the woman of Samaria at the well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never&nbsp;thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water&nbsp;springing up&nbsp;into everlasting life. (John 4:13-14)</p>
<p>Notice that it "shall be in him a well of water"; this well comes from the Savior and becomes an <em>internal</em> water source--one that comes from within. How do we acquire and then drink from this well of spiritual water? We can come to devotional, feast on the scriptures daily, fast, commune with our Heavenly Father in prayer, worship on Sunday, and attend the temple. These are all ways to drink deeply from this well. How do <em>you</em> drink from the well? Just as our physical bodies cannot survive very long without water, our spirits also have need of spiritual water. <br /><br />We are reminded of this water in several ordinances of the gospel, from the water in the sacrament, which represents the blood our Savior freely spilled for us, to the waters of baptism, through which we may become clean from sin and be born again in a new spiritual life. <br /><br />"I was thirsty and ye gave me drink" (Matthew 25:35). &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>3. "I was a stranger, and ye took me in"</strong> <br /><br />Next: "I was a stranger, and ye took me in" (Matthew 25:35). What exactly does that mean? As a linguist, I am interested in words, what they mean, and where they come from. In the Russian Synodal translation of the Bible, the phrase "ye took me in" is rendered <em>vy prinjali menja, </em>using the verb <em>prinjat'</em>,<em> </em>which means "to accept, receive; admit; allow to join." In Russian, many words may be broken down into smaller meaningful chunks, or morphemes, which, as my students can attest, often brings greater insight into those words. The verb <em>prinjat'</em> is made up of three morphemes, meaningful chunks: <em>pri-</em>, which means "bring near"; <em>-nja-</em>, which means "have or take"; and <em>-t'</em>, which means it is a verb. So a literal translation of the phrase "ye took me in" in Russian would sound something like "ye took me near, or close" or "ye have me near, or close." Isn't that what the Savior invites us to do: to have Him near us, close to us? Isn't that beautiful imagery? <br /><br />In the Latin Vulgate Bible, the phrase "ye took me in" is rendered <em>collexistis me, </em>using a verb which usually means "to collect together, assemble, or gather in" and is related to the English words <em>colleague, college, </em>and <em>collect.</em> So if we took all these meanings--accept, receive, admit, allow to join, collect together, assemble, gather in--and squished them all together, to use a technical linguistic term, I think we would have a good sense of what the phrase "ye took me in" means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But what about the "stranger"? "I was a stranger, and ye took me in." The Bible Dictionary defines <em>stranger</em> in this way: "The word is frequently used to denote a man of non-Israelite birth, resident in the promised land with the permission of the Israelite authorities" (Bible Dictionary <em>Stranger</em>). So in the biblical sense a stranger was a person from another country, from another place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's pull all of our definitions together: I was a person from another country, from another place, and ye accepted me, received me, admitted me, allowed me to join, collected me together, assembled with me, gathered me in. As we "take in or receive" others, it is as though we are taking in or receiving the Savior Himself.</p>
<p>What exactly does that mean for you and for me, right here, today? Who are these "others," the "strangers" of which the Savior speaks? I think I might have an answer. Take a moment to look around you. Do you see people you don't know? Are they from another place or even country? Unless you are in a room with only your immediate family members, I would say that you have found "strangers." Are we not all strangers - people from different places, different countries? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we take people in, as the Savior instructs? Does this mean that we open our apartments or homes to everyone everywhere? That's probably not very practical. There will be times when we can literally welcome others into our homes, as so many people have done across Europe with the ongoing refugee crisis there. The generosity and service shown by the people of Rexburg and the surrounding area during the Teton Dam flood of 1976 are an instructive legacy of selfless service for this region. But we don't usually have refugees or floods pouring through our communities on a regular basis. How, then, do we take people in? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think back to the definitions I gave for the phrase "I was a stranger, and ye took me in." Considering this in a more spiritual or social sense, isn't Christ inviting us to accept, take in, and admit "strangers" into our own homes, circles of friends, wards, and stakes? I invite you to take a minute and think about "strangers" around you. Is there someone in your apartment, your ward, your classes, or perhaps your neighborhood that might feel like a total stranger? Perhaps he or she is new to the area or doesn't seem to fit in. Do you think he or she might feel like a total stranger sometimes? Have you yourself ever felt that way? My invitation for all of us here today is to find a "stranger," take him or her in, and help him or her feel what Paul describes in his epistle to the Ephesians: <br /><br />"Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God" (Ephesians 2:19). This is our Savior's invitation to us.</p>
<p>"I was a stranger, and ye took me in."<strong> </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong><strong>4. &nbsp;"Naked, and ye clothed me"</strong> <br /><br />Next: "naked, and ye clothed me." I'm sure very few, if any, of us passed by someone who utterly lacked clothing on our way to this devotional today. But how many of us have donated clothing to Deseret Industries or Goodwill or other charitable thrift stores? How often do we contribute to the Humanitarian Aid program of the Church? In the April 2016 general women's session of general conference, Sister Linda K. Burton, general Relief Society president, extended the following invitation: "It is our hope that you will prayerfully determine what you can do--according to your own time and circumstance--to serve the refugees living in your neighborhoods and communities. This is an opportunity to serve one on one, in families, and by organization to offer friendship, mentoring, and other Christlike service and is one of many ways sisters can serve" ("I Was a Stranger", <em>Ensign, </em>May 2016). I think it would be appropriate to extend that invitation to all of us. <br /><br />How can we get involved? How can we help? There are great resources, videos, ideas, and links on a special page dedicated to the refugee relief effort on the Church's website at <em>lds.org/refugees</em>. <br /><br />As the Savior instructed the prophet Joseph Smith, "Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (D&amp;C 81:5). <br /><br />Let us do more in our efforts to clothe the naked and relieve suffering wherever it may occur. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Naked, and ye clothed me."<strong> </strong> &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>5. &nbsp;"I was sick, and ye visited me"</strong> <br /><br />Fifth: "I was sick, and ye visited me." I'm sure we have all been sick at some point in our lives. And when you're feeling under the weather, who doesn't appreciate a reassuring visit from family or friends? I think of loneliness in this same category of need. When I was in graduate school in Illinois, I was home teacher to a dear elderly sister in our ward, Zada Purrington. She lived alone in an assisted living center but made great efforts to come to church. We lived far from our own families and grandparents, so Zada became a kind of adopted grandparent for our young children. We loved to visit and spend time with her, even though she could barely hear us. I know she was lonely and was often sick, but she was always happy to see us. I'm sure (I hope!) she appreciated our visits with three young girls in tow, and I know we certainly were greatly blessed by our association with her. This kind of service brings blessings in abundance to all involved. <br /><br />We recently had the missionaries visit our home for dinner and a message. They shared with us a video from the Mormon Messages series entitled "Lift: The Power of Service." You'll find it on YouTube--just search for "Mormon Messages Lift." Not right now, of course; we're not quite done. But once the devotional is over and you have a few minutes, I would highly recommend you watch it. After the elders showed the video, they challenged us to think of people we know, people we work with, people we go to school with, and decide on a specific way that we will reach out and serve them in the coming week. I now echo their invitation and extend it to all of you: Think of a way you can reach out and serve someone in this coming week. Then go and do it! <br /><br />"I was sick, and ye visited me." &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>6. "I was in prison, and ye came unto me"</strong> <br /><br />And number six: "I was in prison, and ye came unto me." I believe that one of the principles the Savior is trying to teach us is not to judge. Notice that he didn't say, "I was in prison, and ye considered whether I was worthy of a visit or not." When someone is in prison, this is probably one of the lowest points of their life. It is exactly at this point that the Savior especially invites us to reach out and visit. My parents-in-law served a Church service mission as Addiction Recovery missionaries at the county jail near where they live. The people they met and had the chance to serve and teach had hit low points in their lives. The hope, though, that the gospel of Jesus Christ offers these people was often transformational. They knew that someone cared. <br /><br />I've mentioned physical prisons, but are there not also spiritual prisons in which many are incarcerated? In Doctrine &amp; Covenants, section 84, we read, "And the whole world lieth in sin, and groaneth under darkness and under the bondage of sin" (D&amp;C 84:49). Whether they be prisons of addiction, depression, doubt, or sin, many among us find themselves so bound. How do we help? How do we "come unto them" that feel they are in a very real kind of bondage? Elder Holland, in the 2013 October general conference, movingly spoke of his own struggles with depression and gives counsel on how to help: "So how do you best respond when mental or emotional challenges confront you or those you love? Above all, never lose faith in your Father in Heaven, who loves you more than you can comprehend. As President Monson said to the Relief Society sisters so movingly last Saturday evening: 'That love never changes. . . . It is there for you when you are sad or happy, discouraged or hopeful. God's love is there for you whether or not you feel you deserve [it]. It is simply always there' " (Jeffrey R. Holland, <em>Ensign, </em>November 2013). <br /><br />I had an experience several years ago that taught me the power of asking and its role in bringing comfort. One day I noticed that one of the students in my Russian class was visibly distraught when she arrived for class. We had a few minutes before class was to start, and she sat down in the back of the classroom, near the door. As the rest of the class chatted and prepared for class, I thought to myself, "Hmm... Maybe I should go talk to her." I walked back and, out of earshot of the others, asked her if she was okay. She shook her head and asked if we could step out in the hall. She then confided in me that on her way to my class she had learned--on Facebook, of all places--of some devastating news about her family situation. She didn't know what to do. I suggested that she skip class--can you believe it!--and take time right then to deal with the situation. She thanked me and left. I was proud of her for just showing up to class and am sure she would not have learned or retained anything about Russian short-form past passive participles that day. Looking back, I was glad that I had asked that one simple question. I checked in from time to time with her on how things were going, and my sense was that she was appreciative that someone cared, and cared enough to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;"I was in prison, and ye came unto me." <br /><br />Those who heard Jesus give these six directions had likely never personally seen the Savior in the circumstances he describes in Matthew, chapter 25. They may well have asked themselves the same question that Jesus then posed: "Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?" (Matthew 25:37-39).&nbsp; Do we not sometimes ask ourselves similar questions? If the Savior were in prison, would we not all go to visit Him? If He came to our home, would we not take Him in? If He were sick, would we not visit him? <br /><br />The Savior's conclusion to this teaching may hit us close to home: "Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40). When we reach out and serve others, we are serving the Savior Himself. <br /><br />I testify that our Heavenly Father lives and loves us, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Thomas S. Monson is the Lord's prophet today. <br /><br />That we may feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, take in the stranger, clothe the naked, visit the sick, and go to those in prison is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Area Seventy</p>
<p>Elder Alan C. Batt was born in Idaho Falls, and lives in the Rigby, Idaho area.&nbsp; After graduating from Rigby High School, he attended Ricks College.<br /><br />Elder Batt worked as a building contractor for several years and was president of Batt Construction, Inc. &nbsp; <br /><br />From 2008-2011, Elder Batt presided over the Brazil Fortaleza Mission.&nbsp; Prior to that, he served as a stake president, bishop, counselor in a stake mission presidency, high councilor, stake Young Men president, and missionary in the Brazil South Central Mission. He currently serves as an Area Seventy, a position to which he was sustained at the April 2013 General Conference. &nbsp; <br />Elder Batt and his wife, Millie, are the parents of four children and have four grandchildren.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>While serving a mission in Brazil, I attended the baptism of a man who had been preparing for eight months to be baptized. &nbsp;He told me he had decided to change his life one night while partying and drinking with his friends when the thought came to him, "Is this what you want your life to be?"<br /><br /> This is a question each of us can ask ourselves: "Is this what we want our lives to be?" <br /><br />If we continue on the path we are on, will it lead us to where we really want to go? <br /><br />President David O. McKay said, "Next to the bestowal of life itself, the right to direct that life is God's greatest gift to man" (<em>Teachings of the Presidents of the Church: David O. McKay</em> [2003], 208). <br /><br />Agency is the ability and privilege God gives us to choose and act for ourselves. Those choices are an essential part of the plan of salvation--the plan for our salvation. &nbsp; <br /><br />A story is told of a large banquet held in the state capital. Those in attendance were in a line being served their dinner. A woman who was serving gave each one in line a piece of chicken. One man came by and said, "I'd like two pieces of chicken." She said to him, "I'm sorry, but it's just one piece of chicken per person." He said, "I don't think you understand who I am. I'm the governor of this state, and I want two pieces of chicken." She replied, "I don't think you understand who I am. I'm the lady in charge of the chicken." <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, we are in charge of the chicken. We determine who we become. Some might say, "But you don't understand. I grew up in a broken home; my father was an alcoholic," or "I'm the only member of the Church in my family." I know things like this affect us, but ultimately each of us has that God-given right to choose for ourselves.&nbsp; With the help of a loving Heavenly Father, we can make wise decisions that lead to happiness.&nbsp; What is important is not our circumstances or who we are right now but who we can become. <br /><br />It can be difficult to make wise choices in the world in which we live. Sometimes we feel lost and alone as we strive to choose the right, but we are never alone. We have family and friends who love us, leaders who teach us, and a Father in Heaven who is always there to help if we'll just listen and pay attention. <br /><br />One Sunday morning last December, I was in Idaho Falls doing some Church work. I turned down a street behind a pickup truck pulling a livestock trailer. As the driver made the turn, the side door of his trailer swung open, and an old Holstein cow rolled out and landed in someone's yard. It sat there for a second and then got up and bellowed in disbelief. The truck driver didn't stop, so I thought I'd better catch him and tell him his cow had fallen out. I honked my horn, flashed my lights, and waved my arm out the window, but he just wouldn't stop. It was slick with snow and ice on the road, so I couldn't get too close. So I just kept following him. I followed for almost 15 minutes, trying to get his attention. Finally he pulled into his farmyard. When he stopped, the trailer door swung open again and out came three more old cows. I said to him, "Hey, you lost one of your cows back there!" "Oh," he said, and counted "one, two, three" as the cows walked away. I said, "If you want, I'll go back with you to show you where it fell out". He said, "Oh, I think I know. Was it where you started honking your horn and waving at me?" <br /><br />Are we like the man who lost his cow?&nbsp; Are we not paying attention to those who are trying to help us? <br /><br />The world is a noisy, confusing place. We are pushed and pulled in every direction. We are told that good is bad and bad is good. It's easy to be confused and distracted, or even deceived. We can be swept away in a tidal wave of uncertainty if we don't choose wisely.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sometimes what appears on the surface to be real is not. <br /><br />While serving with my wife in Brazil, we were blessed to have Elder Holland visit our mission.&nbsp; We were able to have a picture taken of Elder and Sister Holland with all of our missionaries. &nbsp;At the end of our mission, one of the stake presidents that we served with gave us a large framed copy of that picture. As I looked at everyone in the picture, I noticed the stake president in the left corner next to the missionaries. I said, "President, thank you so much for this beautiful picture, but I don't remember you being there". He said, "I wasn't, but I wanted to be, so I just Photoshopped myself into the picture." If you just looked at the picture and didn't know better, you would think he was there, but he wasn't. What appeared to be real was not. <br /><br />As a side note, we can't Photoshop ourselves into the celestial kingdom. If only it were that easy. Only wise choices will get us there. <br /><br />In the Book of Mormon, we read of Lehi's dream of the great and spacious building: "And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the&nbsp;other&nbsp;side of the river of water, a great and&nbsp;spacious building; and it stood as it were in the&nbsp;air, high above the earth" (1 Nephi 8:26). <br /><br />The great and spacious building appeared "as it were in the air." Was it so because it represents something that is not real? Was Lehi trying to tell us that it was a mirage? That it had no foundation? I think he's telling us that there is no real satisfaction in the things of the world and continually seeking these things will never bring true happiness. We will find that we never have enough and we can never be enough. <br /><br />To understand what is important and what choices will bring us closer to our Father in Heaven, we must have more faith in what we feel and what we know to be true than the things we see or hear in this confusing world. A while back, while searching the Internet, I found one of my favorite quotes from President Abraham Lincoln. The quote is, "Don't believe everything you read on the Internet." Sometimes we hear or see things that are contrary to what we have known most of our lives. As we seek answers, we must know that we will never find light and truth in the dark corners of the Internet. <br /><br />When seeking truth, we must seek it where there is light, where we can feel the Spirit. <br /><br />My older brother played high-school basketball, and our family loved to watch his team play. We went to all of the home games but hardly ever went to the away games. Maybe it was the cost or maybe the distance, but we just didn't go. Even though we couldn't attend the away games, we never missed listening to them on the radio. The only problem we had was that we couldn't receive the radio signal where we lived. All we got was static, so every night there was an away game, we got in our car and drove &frac14; mile down the road and parked in front of the neighbor's house. There, we could get a signal and could clearly hear the game. Just driving &frac14; mile down the road made it possible to hear. <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, we have to put ourselves where we can feel the Spirit. If we don't feel the Spirit in our lives and struggle to make wise decisions, we need to determine why. We need to think about what we are doing or where we are. Often all we need to do is put ourselves where we can feel the promptings of our Father in Heaven. Maybe we have a special place, maybe just being alone in our car or apartment, or going to the temple. Wherever it is, we need to take the time and make the effort to get in tune and receive personal revelation that will help us make wise choices. <br /><br />Then, when we've received our answer, we must have faith in what we know and feel. <br /><br />In this past general conference, Elder Ballard said, "Sometimes we can learn, study, and know, and sometimes we have to believe, trust, and hope" ("To Whom Shall We Go?" <em>Ensign</em>, November 2016) <br /><br />There are questions that may never be answered and things we may never fully understand, but we should never doubt what we know to be true. What is true is true. What we know we know. What we have felt we have felt. <br /><br />We will make many choices throughout our lives. Today I'd like to talk about three choices that can help us find the joy Heavenly Father wants for each of us. <br /><br />The first choice is, choose to share the gospel. <br /><br />Sharing the gospel will bring a sweet spirit into our lives. When we testify of the truth, our testimonies are strengthened. Sometimes we get discouraged because every experience doesn't end with what we see as success. Every missionary experience may not be successful as we see it, but each one will be worthwhile. All the Lord expects is that we do our part. <br /><br />We should remember that those we work with are precious sons and daughters of our Eternal Father and deserve respect and understanding. People should never be considered a project. We should never abandon someone because they don't respond or accept our invitation. <br /><br />When we try to encourage someone to come back or learn about the gospel and they respond, "No, thanks," often they are really saying, "Just give me a little more time. Don't stop loving me. I'm not ready yet. Don't give up on me." <br /><br />I visited a 16- and 17-year-old Sunday School class one Sunday morning. When the teacher came into the classroom, he wrote on the chalkboard, "The Plane Truth." P-L-A-N-E. I thought to myself, "I wonder where he went to school? I hope it wasn't BYU-Idaho." I soon learned what this meant. Two young people came to the front of the class and sat in two chairs and then began to role-play sharing the gospel to someone sitting next to them on an airplane. They did a great job. <br /><br />It made me think of a story I'd recently heard of a lady who was sharing the gospel with the person sitting next to her on a flight. The person she was talking to became very interested in knowing more, and the member of the Church said, "Oh, I wish I had a Book of Mormon to give you. I usually have one with me when I travel, but I forgot this time." Just then, someone in the seat behind her reached over and handed her a Book of Mormon. I'm not sure if it was a good member who had overheard the conversation trying to do their part or someone trying to get rid of a book they had just received. <br /><br />These experiences inspired me to want to share the gospel the next time I was on an airplane. <br /><br />A few weeks later, I flew to area council meetings, and I got my chance. On the way home I committed myself to share the gospel with the person sitting next to me on the plane. If those kids could do it, so could I. On the first flight, I sat next to a young man who had no interest in hearing about the Church. All he wanted to talk about was all of his girlfriends, his pickup truck, and how much beer he could drink. I was so discouraged I wanted to jump out of the plane. <br /><br />On the second flight, I waited anxiously to meet my next flight companion. He was from Germany. He spoke English pretty well, and I talked to him about the Church. He said that he had never heard of the Church and changed the subject but was still friendly and wanted to talk. I asked where he was staying and offered him a ride to his hotel when we arrived in Idaho Falls. I asked him why he was going to Idaho. He explained that he was going to ride horses and herd cattle at a nearby ranch. He said he had received information telling him that he needed a hat. I said, "That's a good idea. It's hot there. You'll get a sunburn without one". "How about cowboy boots?" he asked. I thought to myself, "Please don't do this to me. It's Saturday night, and I'm sure you're going to want me to help you buy boots on Sunday." So I told him, "If you buy new boots and wear them for five days straight, you'll probably never walk again the rest of your life. But I have a pair of boots in my closet at home that are a little too small for me. They are in good shape, and you can have them if you want." I asked, "What size do you wear?" He told me some European size, and I said, "Oh, I'm sure they'll fit." <br /><br />When we arrived at the hotel, he said "Oh, what about the boots? When can I get the boots?" I said, "I have church tomorrow, so after church I'll..." Then I thought to myself, "You big chicken! If those kids can do it, why can't you?" So I said, "Or, if you'd like, you can go to church with me, and I can give you the boots then." He said, "Okay." I was a little shocked and pleased, but having been a missionary, I knew he might not be there when I went to pick him up. <br /><br />The next morning, when I went into the hotel lobby to meet him, he wasn't there. As I went outside to leave, he came running around the building and said, "I was looking for you." I could hardly believe it! He got in the car, and we headed for church. When we arrived, I introduced him to a few members of my ward. Everyone that spoke one word of German, had ever seen a German movie, or even eaten sauerkraut surrounded him. He felt so welcome. I had copied off some Church materials and talks in German for him the night before, mostly stuff by President Uchtdorf. He really seemed to enjoy his time there. When we got in the car to go back to the hotel, he thanked me for inviting him to church and said, "I go to church almost every Sunday in Germany, but I have never felt what I felt today." I had come so close to not letting one of Heavenly Father's children feel His Spirit. And to think that I almost missed this wonderful opportunity to share the gospel. <br /><br />The second choice is, choose to be clean. <br /><br />A missionary who was sent home early from his mission told me in an interview that he had never once in his life felt clean. <br /><br />It made me sad to think that, with the Atonement of Jesus Christ available to all of us, he had never felt clean--that he had never had the peace and strength that comes from being forgiven. <br /><br />In contrast to this experience, I once interviewed a young man for a temple recommend as he prepared to be married. As I asked the questions, I asked him if he lived the law of chastity. He told me that he had never, in any way, violated any part of that commandment. I said, "That's wonderful. How did you do it?" He told me that, as a young deacon, he was taught the Lord's moral code and that he had decided to live it. <br /><br />He succeeded because he had decided what he wanted his life to be. <br /><br />One day, a missionary came in for his scheduled interview. He explained that he had a problem. I said to him, "Elder, I just can't help you." "What do you mean you can't help me? You're the mission president!" I said, "Every time we meet, we have this same discussion. I can't help you because you don't want to stop doing what you're doing." "But President, I can't stop doing what I'm doing." I responded, "Then maybe I should call your girlfriend, that sweet girl who's at home waiting for you, and tell her you are having problems so she can start looking for someone else." Some of the color left his face. "Or maybe it would be better to call your mother and let her tell your girlfriend." The rest of the color left his face. "Or maybe if you have this problem again, we could just send you home." He said, "President, maybe I can change. You know, I'm sure I can." I said, "Elder, I know you can. You just have to want to change." <br /><br />Change is not something that happens without an effort on our part. We have to decide and choose to change. Then we can go to Heavenly Father for help. Through faith in the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can be helped and healed. <br /><br />Remember, we're in charge of the chicken. It's our choice. Satan can't force us to sin. The only power he has is what we give him. <br /><br />I've never done anything wrong in my life that I didn't know was wrong the moment I did it. As a mission president, I interviewed many people who had serious problems before they were baptized--people who were as spiritually depleted as anyone could be. As we discussed the things they had done, not one of them ever said to me, "I didn't know it was wrong." They often told me, "I knew when I did it that it was not right. I felt it." <br /><br />We know when we're not square with the Lord. We know by the way we feel. We should recognize our sins and weaknesses and be honest with ourselves and not use excuses like, "It's not my fault," "I didn't know it was wrong," "Everybody is doing it," "Times have changed." This is what Satan wants us to believe and say. <br /><br />Satan is a master of deception and will do all in his power to impede our efforts to be clean. He will tempt us always and poison us slowly if we listen to his lies. Sometimes he does it so cunningly that we hardly know it's happening. <br /><br />One of my childhood friends had a pigpen located under some large shade trees behind his house. In the pen there was every kind of pig--big ones, little ones, sows, boars, weaner pigs, and feeder pigs. The pen was filled with mud, manure, and pigs. We didn't have color TV or video games, so sometimes we would just go sit on the fence and watch the pigs. This might seem like odd behavior, but really it wasn't much different than watching reality TV today. We watched the pigs fight, root around in the mud and manure, and do whatever pigs do. One day my friend's father pulled into the yard with his pickup overflowing with some of the most wonderful things my eyes had ever seen. It was filled with donuts, bread, cupcakes, and Twinkies that had passed their expiration date. He backed up to the pigpen and shoveled his cargo into the muck. The pigs began to devour their food, wrappers and all. Each mouthful was filled with cupcakes or Twinkies, plastic wrappers smeared with mud and manure. It was awful and disgusting. &nbsp;It made me sick to my stomach. Over the next few weeks, each time we watched this happen, it started to be a little less repulsive and became a little more entertaining. What had seemed so foul and ugly became something we looked forward to. One day I told my friend that I had heard that Twinkies never expire, so if we could figure a way to get some of the Twinkies out of the pigpen without the pigs attacking us, we could have free treats. We couldn't go into the pen, so we took a rake and pulled a large blob of mud, manure, and Twinkies from under the fence. We washed the wrappers off with water and, after checking for holes or tears, sat on the fence and ate Twinkies with the pigs. Isn't this exactly how Satan works? He takes something that is dirty, foul, and disgusting, and over time we start to accept it as entertaining, desirable, and good. The next time you think of doing something foolish, imagine yourself sitting on a fence eating Twinkies with the pigs. <br /><br />If we have found ourselves in the mud and made mistakes that make us feel unworthy, remember what President Boyd K. Packer has said: "Save for the exception of the very few who defect to perdition, there is no habit, no addiction, no rebellion, no transgression, no apostasy, no crime exempted from the promise of complete forgiveness. That is the promise of the atonement of Christ" ("The Brilliant Morning of Forgiveness," <em>Ensign</em>, November 1995, 20). <br /><br />No matter where we've been or what we've done, we can be clean. It is our choice. <br /><br />The third choice: Choose to be happy. <br /><br />Even when we make right choices, our lives don't always turn out like we imagined, planned, or even worked to achieve. We might have health trials, children or spouses might have a crisis of faith, marriage might end in divorce, or we might remain single.&nbsp; <br /><br />When we look at the life of Christ, we see that even though He was perfect, the path He walked took Him through many of the same challenges we face in life. Jesus encountered disappointment, temptation, and pain. <br /><br />There are things in our lives that are not in our control, so the only thing we can do is try to control how we react to them. <br /><br />Emily Kingsley wrote an essay where she compared her unexpected challenge, having a disabled child, to getting on a plane for a vacation to Italy she had planned and looked forward to for years, but instead she landed in Holland. Then she has this imaginary conversation: <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>"Holland? What do you mean, Holland? I signed up for Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going to Italy."</em> <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>"But there has been a change in the flight plan. You've landed in Holland, and there you must stay."</em> <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>But then you meet others that have been to Italy, and they are all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And you say, "Yes, that's where I was supposed to go.&nbsp; That's what I had planned."</em> <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>But if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to go to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things about Holland. Accepting the unexpected realities that happen in our lives can free us from despair and allow us to rejoice in the life we have.</em> <br /><br />Through righteous living, our happiness can be complete as we embrace life in its full, unpredictable way.<br />Happiness does not come from what we have, what world status we might attain, or having all go as planned. It comes from understanding who we are and making choices that draw us closer to the Savior. It comes from the knowledge that our personal weaknesses do not define us. It comes from listening to those who build, lift, and encourage us so we can understand better our divine nature. <br /><br />In the first interview with each missionary, I liked to help them see their talents, build them up, and encourage them. Before new missionaries arrived, I read all the information on their applications to get to know them a little. I was a little concerned about one of the new elders. He was relatively new in the Church and came from difficult circumstances. I worried that he might lack the experience and background to be an effective missionary. As this young elder sat before me, I wanted to say something to encourage him, but I just couldn't think of anything I could tell him without giving him false hope. What could I say? Finally I said, "Elder, I have a feeling that you are going to be a great missionary. You are going to be such a blessing to our mission and a great blessing to the people here." He looked at me like, "What did you just say?" I thought to myself, "What did I say?" A few weeks later, I received a letter from him. He wrote, "President, I've been thinking a lot about what you said in my interview. I even wrote my mother about what you told me. We think you might be right." <br /><br />Our mission was split soon after, and I never saw this elder again. Later, however, I met his new president at a training meeting. He asked me, "Do you remember Elder So-and-So?" I wanted to say, "Hey, I only had him for a while, so whatever he's done has nothing to do with me." He said, "Elder So-and-So is an amazing missionary; he has been such a blessing to our mission and to the people he has taught." As I thought about what I had told him in that first interview, I realized that the words I had spoken had not come from me. Those were the words of a loving Heavenly Father telling his son, "I love you. You can be great. You can do it." <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, as we ask ourselves the question "Is this what you want your life to be?" I pray that we will have the courage to have faith in ourselves, faith to be clean, and faith to choose wisely so we might have eternal happiness. This is what our Father in Heaven wants for all of us. He loves us. He wants us back. He's telling us we can do it. <br /><br />I testify that God lives and knows each of us, and through the Atonement of His Son--our Savior, Jesus Christ--we can return to Him. I know this to be true. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>President and Sister Gilbert, Jane and I thank you for this opportunity. Being on this campus today has brought back a flood of memories for both of us. BYU-Idaho looks quite different than it did when we were students here 40 years ago. For one thing, this conference center didn't exist back then. And, as you may know, Ricks College once had a football team--in fact, I came to Ricks as a football player. Back then, I was one of 4,500 students; now there are almost 18,000. I don't think any of us imagined 40 years ago what this school could become.<br /><br />If you don't mind hearing a personal story, I'd like to share with you my BYU-Idaho experience. I do so not because I think my story is noteworthy but because it might help those of you who are looking at <em>your </em>next 40 years--or even your next semester--with trepidation. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Canada Trip, 1976</strong> <br />The day after I graduated from high school in 1976, I left with a friend for a weeklong road trip from Utah to Canada. We borrowed my grandma's car and packed it with the essentials: two sleeping bags, several cans of fruit cocktail, and a couple dozen frozen burritos. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />The trip was great until the last few days, when we ran out of food and most of our money. Then, somewhere near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, we noticed that we were almost out of gas. We found a gas station, but the price of gas was 20 percent higher than we had paid in a previous town. Thoroughly offended by this literal example of highway robbery, we kept right on driving, thinking to ourselves, "We'll show them who's smart." Well, 15 miles down the road, in the middle of nowhere, we ran out of gas. We hitched a ride back to the town and humbly begged for the use of a gas can. Two hours later we were back on the road, a little humbler, a little poorer, and hopefully a little wiser. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>First Semester at Ricks College</strong> <br />I had planned to attend the University of Utah, but in August I had a strong impression that I should go to Ricks--an impression that may have been amplified by the fact that Jane Stringham was also planning to go to Ricks. I called the football coach, and he said he could offer a scholarship. Before I knew it, I was on the football field during the first day of practice. Coach Tiny Grant shook my hand, assigned two players to be my roommates, and told me to get a haircut--my hair did not quite meet the dress and grooming standards. Now, at about 6-foot-5, 300 pounds, Tiny Grant was not so tiny, so I obeyed! &nbsp; <br /><br />I made the first team as a running back, but soon I faced a dilemma. My sister was getting sealed in the Salt Lake Temple the next weekend, so I asked Coach Grant if I could go home for her wedding. He said it was my choice, but I might not retain my starting spot when I returned. I chose to go. I got tickets for an 8 a.m. flight from Idaho Falls to Salt Lake. &nbsp; <br /><br />This would be my first time flying alone, but I wasn't worried. I had everything planned out: I woke up that morning at 7, got ready, and made the 30-minute drive to Idaho Falls. I arrived at the airport at 7:55 feeling pretty good--I had a good five minutes to spare! On my way from the parking lot to the terminal, however, I learned that my plane was about to leave. "You'll never make it," the airport personnel told me. In a panic, I ran onto the tarmac--you could do that in a small airport in those days--and waved my hands in front of the plane, yelling, "Don't leave! I need to get on the plane! It's my sister's wedding!" The next thing I remember was two security men hauling me off the tarmac, saying, "You're not getting on that plane!" &nbsp; <br /><br />Needless to say, I missed my sister's wedding. But I did manage to convince security that I was not a serious threat, and I caught a later flight in time for her reception. When I returned to Rexburg on Monday, I also learned that I had lost my starting spot on the team for the next week's game. &nbsp; <br /><br />As you can see, I had plenty of growing up to do during my first few months at Ricks College. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Spiritual Milestones</strong> <br />But I don't want you to think that all of my learning experiences were misadventures with planes and automobiles. I also made some wise decisions. For example, it was during my first semester at Ricks that I decided to read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover. Somehow, I had never done that before. I'd read <em>from </em>the Book of Mormon--I had even taught lessons from it. I could tell you why we have the Book of Mormon and why it's important, and I could bear testimony that it is the word of God. But now a full-time mission was approaching, and I sensed that my conviction about the Book of Mormon was more in my head than in my heart. I knew that as a missionary, I needed more than just a working knowledge of the Book of Mormon--I wanted to teach from the heart! &nbsp; <br /><br />So I set a goal to finish the Book of Mormon before the Thanksgiving break. I read every day after football practice. This was a life-changing experience. For the first time, the stories I had heard in pieces started flowing together. I could almost see Nephi, Alma, and Captain Moroni; visions of their experiences formed in my mind, and I can still see those images to this day. It was my first real experience "feasting upon the word of Christ,"<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> and it was "delicious to me."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />On the day before Thanksgiving, I was in Ether, so I stayed up all night and accomplished my goal. When I finished, I prayed, as Moroni suggests, to "ask God ... if these things are not true."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> Did I receive a dramatic revelation? No. But I did receive a feeling of peace, consistent with the feelings I had while reading the book. I now had the ingredient that was missing, not just in my mission preparation but in my conversion to the Savior. &nbsp; <br /><br />At the end of the semester came a rapid succession of spiritual milestones--I received the Melchizedek Priesthood, my patriarchal blessing, my endowment in the temple, and a call to serve in the Texas San Antonio Mission. By March 17, 1977, the young man who ran out of gas in the middle of Idaho and ran out onto the tarmac at the Idaho Falls airport was serving the Lord in the mission field. &nbsp; <br /><br />When I returned, I had decided to go to BYU in Provo, not to Ricks. But yet again, the Lord seemed to be nudging me back toward Rexburg--in His own wisdom and for His own purposes. Two of my friends, who had also just returned from missions, were going to Ricks, and they encouraged me to go with them. So, in the fall of 1979, here I was again for my second semester, this time much more mature spiritually. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now, this story wouldn't be complete without the perspective of my wife. I'd like to invite Jane to join me here and give her side of the story. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Owen's Memories</strong> <br />[Sister Owen] <br />It wasn't obvious at the time, but now we can both clearly see the Lord's wisdom in prompting Steve to return to Ricks--and I am thankful to be married to a man who follows such promptings. By that time, I had graduated from Ricks College, but it just so happened that my sister Patricia was living in Rexburg. She has always been a stabilizing influence in my life, so I found myself visiting her often. Coincidentally, this allowed Steve and me to see each other more often. To make a long story short, by the end of the year, Steve and I were married. And at the end of Steve's fourth semester, our first child was born. &nbsp; <br /><br />Those were sweet, happy days--but they were also lean days. We were poor as newlyweds, trying to live on $15 per week. One of Steve's coaches used to leave two gallons of milk from his cows on our doorstep. Acts of kindness like that kept us fed physically, and there were just as many loving friends and mentors who kept us fed spiritually--people like Patricia; Sister Blakely, my dance coach; President Eyring, who was the president of Ricks when we began our studies; and many others. &nbsp; <br /><br />There is an undeniable spirit at BYU&shy;-Idaho. It's difficult to describe but easy to feel. I felt it when I was a student, and I feel it again today. Even visitors who know little about the Church or the Holy Ghost sense that there is something unique about this campus. There are many reasons for this, but I believe part of the reason is you--the pure, humble, valiant people whom the Lord brings to BYU-Idaho to fulfill His holy purposes. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>God Wants to Change You</strong> <br />[Brother Owen] <br />Like Jane, I know the Lord guided our lives during our years in Rexburg. He shaped us significantly, and He continues to do so. &nbsp; <br /><br />So I suppose it shouldn't surprise me that this campus has changed so much in 40 years. After all, I've changed a lot too. But one thing hasn't changed: BYU-Idaho is still fertile ground in which to nourish seeds of faith. Here you can deepen the roots of your conversion and prepare for a lifetime of discipleship. &nbsp; <br /><br />Have you ever thought about the Lord's purposes for bringing you to BYU-Idaho? Perhaps you thought you were here to obtain knowledge--to take some classes about biology, economics, or advanced writing--and then get a diploma and hopefully a job. But I believe God's intentions are much broader than that. He wants to change you--to "convert" you. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Dallin H. Oaks once said, "In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us to <em>know</em> something, the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to <em>become</em> something. ... [It] is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> This statement describes well the difference between BYU-Idaho and other schools. Most teach their students to know something, and they do a fantastic job. But this university, like the restored gospel on which it is founded, challenges you to become something. I hope you see your BYU-Idaho experience as a critical part of your challenge to become. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Examine Your Heart</strong> <br />But what are you to become? Answering that question is part of the challenge, isn't it? You might start by asking yourself, "Where am I spiritually? Where do I want to be? Am I making any progress in that direction?" Or, to use Alma's words, "Have ye experienced [a] mighty change in your hearts?" and "If ye <em>have</em> experienced a change of heart, ... can ye feel so now?"<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> It was this type of self-examination that inspired me to set a goal to read the Book of Mormon as a freshman. It could also inspire you to take the next step in your spiritual progress. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Dale G. Renlund called this doing a spiritual "biopsy" on our hearts. To illustrate, he shared an example from his life as a busy young physician. He often had to work on Sundays, and one Sunday, it looked like he would finish in time to make it to church. On the other hand, if he stayed a little longer, his family would leave without him, and he could stay home and take a much-needed nap. Ultimately, that's what he decided to do. &nbsp; <br /><br />But he couldn't sleep. He was troubled by his decision. Didn't he used to love going to church? What had happened? In humility he examined his life and realized that his busy schedule had made him casual about prayer and scripture study. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Renlund recalled, "I got off the couch, got on my knees, and pleaded with God for forgiveness. ... The next day I brought a Book of Mormon to the hospital. On my to-do list that day, and every day since, were two items: praying at least morning and evening and reading in the scriptures. Sometimes midnight would come, and I would have to quickly find a private place to pray. Some days my scripture study was brief. I also promised Heavenly Father that I would always try to get to church, even if I missed part of the meeting. Over the course of a few weeks, the zeal returned and the fire of testimony burned fiercely again. I promised to never again ... [become] casual about these seemingly small actions."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Can you imagine what would have happened if Elder Renlund had decided that because of his busy schedule, he was excused from praying and reading the scriptures <em>every</em> day? What if he had reasoned that he was just fine spiritually--after all, he wasn't committing any grievous sins; he was just taking a nap! Fortunately, he was humble enough to notice that he was drifting and correct his course. And now this deeply spiritual man is a blessing to the Church and the world as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. &nbsp; <br /><br />My young friends, I urge you to spend some time in quiet conversation with Heavenly Father. Ask Him, "What lack I yet?"<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />The answers may surprise you. The path of conversion--the road between who we are and who Heavenly Father wants us to be--is a long one. There will be times when, for example, you drive past a gas station where you should have stopped. There will be wrong turns and flat tires and even some terrible accidents. Don't let any of that discourage you. Learn from the experience; let it humble you. Submit to some tutoring from the Lord. And whatever you do, don't sit stubbornly or demoralized on the side of the road. Do what it takes to get back on the road and keep driving. &nbsp; <br /><br />Please remember that the Savior loves you. He has promised, "Be of good cheer, for I will lead you along."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Let the Lord Guide You</strong> <br />Often, that will mean altering the plans you have made for your life in favor of His plans. Before the summer of 1976, attending Ricks College was not at all part of my plan. But looking back now, I recognize the series of events by which the Lord invited me to change my plan. How would my life have been different if I had not come to Ricks? I don't know, but I do know that God had pivotal, life-changing experiences and relationships prepared for me here. He has similar experiences prepared for you, and I encourage you to accept His plan for you, even if it differs from your plan for yourself. &nbsp; <br /><br />Consider this example from the life of Elder Dallin H. Oaks: &nbsp; <br /><br />When he was a young man, he looked forward to serving a full-time mission. But one week after he graduated from high school, war broke out in Korea, and young Dallin Oaks was sent into military duty and was unavailable for missionary service. &nbsp; <br /><br />Many years later, when Elder Oaks was 48 years old, he was appointed to the Utah Supreme Court. At that time, Elder Oaks and his wife, June, made a plan for the rest of their lives. They determined that he would serve for 20 years on the court and then retire at age 68, after which they would submit their mission papers and serve, as a couple, the full-time mission neither of them got to serve in their youth. &nbsp; <br /><br />Well, it didn't quite work out that way. Just four years later, Elder Oaks was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles--not exactly the kind of thing you plan ahead for. He would still be serving the Lord, just not in the capacity he anticipated. Then, when he was 66, his wife, June, died of cancer. And two years later, he married his current wife, Kristen. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Oaks observed, "How fundamentally different my life is than I had sought to plan! My professional life has changed. My personal life has changed. But the commitment I made to the Lord--to put Him first in my life and to be ready for whatever He would have me do--has carried me through these changes of eternal importance."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Kristen Oaks learned a similar lesson in her life. I've asked Jane to share Sister Oaks's experience. &nbsp; <br /><br />[Sister Owen] <br /><br />Sister Oaks was 53 when she married Elder Oaks--something she surely never could have foreseen earlier in life. When she was a young adult, she wondered why her desire to be married was not being fulfilled. Wasn't it a righteous desire? Was she doing something wrong? &nbsp; <br /><br />Then a conversation with a friend prompted her to think differently about her life. Instead of always praying to find a husband, she said, "I asked for opportunities to serve and to help others. As a direct result, I began to better understand the needs of those around me." She learned that "Am I doing something wrong?" was the wrong question. Instead she began to ask, "What more can I do that is right?" &nbsp; <br /><br />"I wasn't doing anything wrong," she explained. "I had simply forgotten to maintain an eternal perspective. I had overlooked the many ways I could be an instrument for doing good, for doing the Lord's will. Heavenly Father's timing is not our timing," she concluded, "and we have to trust in Him."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, it is good to have your own plans, but underlying every plan you make should be this one: "Regardless of my own desires, I will seek and follow the Lord's will for my life, no matter what He asks of me." Or, to use the words of the hymn, "I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord. ... I'll be what you want me to be."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />That, brothers and sisters, is hard work. It's the work of conversion, and it's the work of a lifetime. It means changing our hearts so that <em>we</em> want what <em>God</em> wants. As Elder David A. Bednar recently taught, "As we do our best to go where He wants us to go, ... say what He wants us to say, and ... become what He wants us to become, ... gradually, our desires align more completely with His desires, and His purposes become our purposes."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> This is what the Savior wants to convert us into--men and women who are so much like Him in our thoughts and actions that we are one with Him, just as He is one with the Father. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Understand the Plan</strong> <br />[Brother Owen] <br />As Sister Owen said, submitting our lives to God is not easy. But we can make it easier for ourselves. To show you what I mean, I'd like to turn to an example from the lives of Adam and Eve. &nbsp; <br /><br />When Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of Eden, they received a commandment that, at first, they did not understand: Take the firstborn of your flocks, and sacrifice it to the Lord. They trusted the Lord enough to obey, but when an angel asked Adam why he was making sacrifices, Adam said, "I know not, save the Lord commanded me."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Then the angel taught Adam and Eve about the spiritual significance of sacrifice. This wasn't about giving up one of their animals. It was about redemption. It was about "the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father." It meant that although they had fallen, they could be redeemed. The Holy Ghost fell upon them, and they saw the whole plan with new eyes. "Blessed be the name of God," Adam said, "for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy." Eve exclaimed, "Were it not for our transgression we never should have ... known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption. ... &nbsp; <br /><br />"And Adam and Eve blessed the name of God, and they made all things known unto their sons and their daughters."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> Even when temptation came, "Adam and Eve ... ceased not to call upon God."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />My friends, do you see parallels between your life and the experiences of Adam and Eve? Do you sometimes receive counsel from the Lord that you do not completely understand? Sometimes we have to say, "I know not, save the Lord commanded me," obeying out of a sense of duty. This is admirable, but remember that Adam and Eve found joy and the strength to persevere after "God ... made known unto them the plan of redemption."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> This is why we obey the commandments. This is why we raise families. This is why we make sacrifices joyfully--because we know the plan. Seek to understand the doctrine, for as President Boyd K. Packer often reminded us, "True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> It is not enough just to know with our mind; we must <em>understand</em> in our heart. It can't just influence our thoughts; we have to let it change our very nature. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Look to Christ</strong> <br />None of us knows what tomorrow will bring. But we do know one thing: We can put unreserved faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. No matter what happens, eternal life is available because of Christ. Death, pain, and sorrow will eventually become only memories because of Christ. Every inequality, every injustice, every iniquity can be made right because of Christ. &nbsp; <br /><br />This is why Helaman pleaded with his sons to build their foundation "upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God"--because no other foundation can withstand the devil's "mighty winds ... [and] all his hail and his mighty storm." We live in an era of secularism, when people are increasingly putting their trust in worldly philosophies, institutions, and wealth. But all of these will fall, and if we anchor ourselves to them, we will fall also. Christ is the only "sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> Faith and righteousness will prevail. Such faith gives us strength to accept the unknown. It will carry us through anything the future may hold. So "look unto [Him] in every thought; doubt not, fear not."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> Seek to become "a greater follower of righteousness."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> And "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />I have always loved these words from the epistle to the Hebrews: "Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> Brothers and sisters, I stand before you today as a witness of things not seen. I have the assurance that the Lord has guided my path. I could not always see where that path would lead, but now the evidence of God's hand in my life has been revealed in many ways. Most often, they were subtle and gentle manifestations--opportunities and feelings. Isaiah described it this way: "Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it."<a href="/devotionals/brother-stephen-w-owen#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />I don't know how the hand of the Lord will manifest itself in your life, but I invite you to look for it. And then, someday, 40 years from now, maybe you'll have the chance to return to BYU-Idaho. Maybe you'll notice impressive changes to the campus. I hope you will also see profound changes in yourself, and you will be filled with gratitude that during this pivotal time in your life, you allowed the Lord to help you become what He wants you to be. I testify of the Father's great plan of happiness for you and for me, and of the Savior Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice in our behalf makes that plan possible. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p>Religious Education Assistant Department Chair</p>
<p>Greg Venema was raised in Creswell, Oregon. In the fall of 1987 Brother Venema came to Rexburg for the first time to attend Ricks College, and swore he would never come back. It was just too cold and barren. After serving a full time mission in Japan, his best friend encouraged him to return to Ricks where he was blessed to meet and fall deeply in love with his home evening sister, Bonnie. They were married in the Portland Oregon Temple in 1992 and, with the exception of three years in Florida, have lived in this area ever since.</p>
<p>In addition to earning an associate's degree from Ricks College, Brother Venema completed bachelor's and master's degrees at Idaho State University, and later received a Doctorate from the University of Idaho. &nbsp; <br /><br />Brother Venema taught in the seminaries and institutes of the Church Educational System for 16 years and currently works in the Religion Department at BYU-Idaho. &nbsp; <br /><br />He and his wife Bonnie are the parents of seven children, and are expecting their first grandchild. He enjoys hunting, playing basketball, and embarrassing his children.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I want you to know how much I love this place. Not only do I get to teach here and associate with all of you; I also got a great education here, and the best thing that ever happened to me happened on this campus. Her name is Bonnie, and she's seated right behind me on the stand. We actually attended several devotionals together when we were students. I think we even held hands. As a matter of fact, I'm sure of it because I don't remember a single thing any of the speakers said. I was just so happy to be holding a girl's hand. I was living the dream--a returned missionary, at Ricks College, holding hands with the girl that I would someday marry. Now, 24 years, seven children, and almost one grandchild later, here we are at devotional again. She's my companion, my hero, and my very best friend.<br /><br /> Friday we had what I call a "perfect moment in time." Things got so busy during the week that we didn't plan a date. Our kids eventually settled in front of a movie though, so we snuck out and headed for Dairy Queen in my old truck, which is the perfect date vehicle because it has a bench seat and my wife can sit right next to me. There wasn't much time, so we went through the drive-through and got our ice cream and a basket of fries. On our way back we stopped at a light, and I turned to Bonnie and said, "It doesn't get any better than this. This is every man's dream: to eat ice cream, snuggled up next to the woman he loves, in a truck that smells like french fries." The radio wasn't on at the time, but I swear I could hear Journey playing in the background. <br /><br />This will probably embarrass Sister Venema, but I wanted you to get a good look at her.</p>
<p><br /> <img alt="../../../Volumes/DevotionalGraphics/2016%20Fall/Greg%20Venema/Images/Bonni" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202016/Graphics/Image-1_200x300.jpg" width="200" /> <br /><br />Isn't she adorable! I am actually in this picture, but I cropped myself out after a friend of mine, seeing the original in my office, said, "Well, at least half your picture looks good." You're looking at the good half! <br /><br />In 2009 Sister Julie Beck, then the Relief Society general president, made the following observation about young people in the Church: "As I meet with young single adults around the world, I ask them, 'Why does the First Presidency care so much about you and provide so many resources for you?' These are some of the answers I get: 'We are future Church leaders.' 'We need training so we can stay strong.' 'Our testimonies are strengthened in our seminary and institute classes.' 'We need to meet other great Latter-day Saint youth.' 'We are the hope of the future.' I have rarely heard, 'So I will someday be a better father or a better mother.'<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> <br /><br />I want you to know that Sister Beck's observation was true of me when I was your age. I knew I wanted to get married, and I knew I wanted to be a father, but I wasn't necessarily preparing with that role in mind. As a matter of fact, my wife reminded me that the day she approached me with a twinkle in her eye and said, "I feel like it's time to start our family," I took a very long walk--so long that it worried her. It wasn't that I didn't agree or that I doubted her timing or ability to receive revelation. I think I was just overwhelmed with the thought that my life was about to change forever and that I wasn't ready. Now fast-forward 20 or so years. Just the other day, I made this note in my journal: "Sometimes being a dad is exhausting, but I can't think of anything I'd rather do!" <br /><br />Here's something I never anticipated as a young adult. My oldest two children are girls: Alex, who is married and now expecting a child of her own; and Amanda, who is a student here this semester. When they were young teenagers, they pleaded with their mother to go to the midnight premier of a popular movie here in town. Their mom isn't a big movie watcher and didn't have any desire to stay up that late and watch this particular show, so they cornered me. I knew if I went, my girls would be happy and that I could use this as leverage to get them to clean up their room, so I agreed to take them. They promised me I wouldn't be disappointed, because this movie featured vampires and werewolves and was full of non-stop action and adventure. Boy, was I misinformed! <br /><br />When we got to the theater and bought our popcorn, I was surprised to look around a little and see that I was the only man in the room. The whole place was full of teenage girls and their mothers, some of whom were dressed up as vampires with little bite marks on their necks or wearing t-shirts that said "Team this" or "Team that." <br /><br />Once the lights went out and the show started, I felt much less self-conscious, but the movie was hardly the action thriller I was promised. As a matter of fact, about halfway through, one of the main characters appeared with his shirt off, and the room just erupted with cheers, whistling, and raucous applause. When the noise died down, I asked my daughters, "What was that all about?" I'm not sure which of the girls responded, but one of them said, "Dad, it's his abs." <br /><br />When I got home my wife was in bed but still awake and asked me how the evening went. I told her about the experience, including the shirtless werewolf part, and asked her the question that had been on my mind for an hour or so: "So are abs really that important to a woman?" (I hadn't seen them in a few years, but I knew they were in there somewhere.) She quickly replied, "Oh, that's not what makes a married man attractive." <br /><br />&nbsp;I was a little suspicious, but I pressed on. "What does make a married man attractive?" <br /><br />"Vacuum cleaners," she said. "Nothing makes a man more attractive to his wife than to see him pushing the vacuum cleaner around the house." <br /><br />This may be one of those lessons you young men want to learn sooner than later. This is a picture of my son-in-law, Curt, "making himself more attractive." <br /><br /><img alt="Vacuuming husband" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202016/Graphics/Image-2_300x200.jpg" width="300" />&nbsp;<br /><br />Isn't he adorable? Well, I not only scored some points with my daughters that day; I learned an important truth about being an attractive husband. I've been vacuuming ever since. And, incidentally, all the exercise has really been helping my abs. <br /><br />David O. McKay taught, "No other success can compensate for failure in the home."<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> Now, I'm not suggesting that going to the movies with your kids is "success," but it may be a small part of it. Parenting has a lot to do with setting aside things you might rather be doing in order to focus on the needs and wants of your children. President McKay continued,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The greatest trust that can come to a man and woman is the placing in their keeping the life of a little child.... What must the Lord think, then, of parents who, through their own negligence or willful desire to indulge their selfishness, fail properly to rear their children, and thereby prove untrue to the greatest trust that has been given to human beings? ... <br /><br />To the Latter-day Saint the home is truly the basic unit of society; and parenthood is next to Godhood. The secret of good citizenship lies in the home. The secret of instilling faith in God, faith in his Son, the Redeemer of the world, faith in the organizations of the Church, lies in the home. There it is centered. God has placed upon parents the responsibility of instilling these principles into the minds of children. Our schools, our Church organizations, and some worthy social institutions are all helps ..., but none of these--great and important as they are in the lives of our youth--can supplant the permanence and the influence of the parents in the home.<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a> </p>
<p>It takes faith to be a parent, especially when the world is in such commotion. Recent events and elections may cause you to hesitate a little or even wonder if it's possible to raise righteous posterity in the current environment. These verses from the Book of Mormon always give me hope:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that <em>there was still great contention in the land</em>, yea, even in the forty and seventh year, and also in the forty and eighth year.<br /><br /> Nevertheless Helaman did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the judgments, and the commandments of God; and he did do that which was right in the sight of God continually; and <em>he did walk after the ways of his father</em>, insomuch that he did prosper in the land.<br /><br /> And it came to pass that he had two sons. He gave unto the eldest the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest, the name of Lehi. And <em>they began to grow up unto the Lord</em>.<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn4" title="">[iv]</a></p>
<p>Did you notice that the context here was a period of "great contention" and wickedness in the land? In spite of this, Helaman was able to keep the commandments himself and able to pass those values on to his own children. It can be the same for you and your children.<br /><br /> I know all of you want to be married and hope for children, and that the doctrine of the family is important to you. It might be important, however, to ask yourself if parenthood is something you will be content to measure your success by. Is being the best father or mother enough, or will there be something else you attach your self-worth to? It could be an advanced degree, a future career, a hobby, or even a Church calling. Those things are all important and may be necessary in your life and in the kingdom of God, but they are not the most important. If you're not careful, they could even distract you from your highest and best roles. <br /><br />It's interesting that our Church handbook of instructions is set up to remind us that the home should be preeminent in our thinking and planning. The very first chapter is entitled "Families and the Church in God's Plan." In it we read, "God has revealed a pattern of spiritual progress for individuals and families through ordinances, teaching, programs, and activities that are <em>home centered</em> and Church supported. <em>Church organizations and programs exist to bless individuals and families and are not ends in themselves</em>. Priesthood and auxiliary leaders and teachers seek to assist parents, <em>not to supersede or replace them</em>....<em> Church leaders need to be careful not to overwhelm families with too many Church responsibilities.<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn5" title=""><strong>[v]</strong></a></em> <br /><br />You've probably noticed that our modern culture gives inordinate attention to the highly successful. The world teaches that true greatness comes from being out front and on top of all those other "ordinary" people. If we want to be considered successful, we need to be more athletic, more beautiful, more intelligent, and more popular, and have it all documented in social media. You and I, however, know differently. "The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart."<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a>&nbsp; It's the meek that inherit the earth, not the proud. It's the broken-hearted, not the hard-hearted, who have divine approval. It's the one who loses his life that finds it, not the one who seeks to save it. We know it, but in the heat of the moment, or in the grind of daily life, it's easy to forget and become discontented, discouraged, and even depressed with where we are, who we are, and what we're doing.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> <br /><br />Here's an example you may relate to. Years ago I was called away from my home ward to serve on this campus. A week or so after being set apart, a sister came in for an interview and expressed some concern about a calling she had received at the beginning of the semester. As I recall, she said something like this: "I came here to Ricks College and was excited to participate and serve. When the bishop called me into his office, I knew he had a calling for me, and I secretly hoped that it would be something that stretched me and helped me to get to know people. As it turned out, my calling was to be the centerpiece coordinator in Relief Society. I've been doing it, but I know it's not important and no one really cares. What do I do?" First of all, I had no idea what a centerpiece coordinator did. It wasn't in the handbook, and there was no manual I could give her. She explained that she was to call the teacher each week, find out what the lesson topic for that Sunday was, and then create a centerpiece befitting the lesson. We don't do this in priesthood meeting because if it's on the table and it's not edible, the brethren don't care. (Although I did Google "LDS centerpieces" the other day, just for fun, and saw an orange Powerade bottle that said, "Orange you blessed to have the priesthood "Power" to "Ade" you in your life?")<br /><br /> <img alt="../../../Volumes/DevotionalGraphics/2016%20Fall/Greg%20Venema/Images/Poweraide%20C" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202016/Graphics/Image-3_300x300.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />Anyway, regardless of how you feel about the need for centerpieces in our meetings, this good sister felt underwhelmed, and questioned how much she was worth to the Lord. I can't remember exactly what I said to her then, but I have some counsel for any of you, students and faculty alike, who may be struggling with similar feelings now. <br /><br />The Apostle Paul taught the saints at Corinth,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For the body is not one member, but many.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">... God set the members every one of them in the body, <em>as it hath pleased him</em>....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary.<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a></p>
<p>Paul reminds us that different members with distinct and important roles are meant to complement each other so that the whole organism can move and act and fulfill its divine purpose. Just like you would miss an eye if it were plucked out, the Church suffers when members are missing and callings are left undone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know there are a few of you out there who are doing just fine without your tonsils or your appendix or your wisdom teeth, but you get much beyond that and your ability to do all you want to do is impaired. The body of Christ, on the other hand, "hath need of every member, that all may be edified together, that the system may be kept perfect."<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[viii]</a> In other words, there are no tonsils, appendix, or wisdom teeth when it comes to our presence and participation in the kingdom of God. Even though we know this, sometimes our hearts yearn to be used in greater, and sometimes more visible, ways. President Uchtdorf described it this way: "Those who seek to lead may feel they are capable of doing more than what they are currently asked to do. Some might think, 'If only I were a bishop, I could make a difference.' <em>They believe that their abilities far surpass their calling</em>. Perhaps if they were in an important position of leadership, they would work hard at making a difference. But they wonder, 'What possible influence can I have as merely a home teacher or a counselor in the quorum presidency?'"<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[ix]</a> (And I would add, "Or as a father or a mother in my home.") <br /><br />I worry sometimes that we create and perpetuate the false idea that becoming like Christ can only happen as we labor outside the home, progressing from one calling to the next in a steady succession of ever-increasing responsibility. Some, for example, believe the ideal track to exaltation begins in the mission field with a rapid rise to senior companion, then DL, ZL, and capstone service as an AP (I apologize to any of you sisters who would like to be used as a bad example here, but it's generally men who have dumb ideas like this). Shortly after your return, you would be chosen as the elders quorum president in your student ward, where you would inspire 100 percent home teaching. After marrying the Relief Society president, you would graduate, settle down, begin to raise the perfect family, and immediately be called as a counselor in the bishopric, and then as bishop a few years later. Your exceptional service will soon after merit a call to the high council, counselor in the stake presidency, and finally as stake president--all prior to your 40th birthday. From there it's mission president, Area Authority Seventy, and then a red chair at general conference. <br /><br />If this line of reasoning were true--and it's definitely not--very few people would ever qualify for exaltation in this life. There just aren't enough leadership callings of that magnitude available. Believing this, whether we admit it or not, can also be spiritually dangerous to us and to our families because it gives Satan a great opportunity to minimize the God-given roles we already have and to appeal to our pride. We get a glimpse of how the Lord feels in an 1831 chastisement of William W. Phelps. He is told, "And also he hath need to repent, for I, the Lord, am not well pleased with him, for he seeketh to excel, and he is not sufficiently meek before me."<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[x]</a> <br /><br />Now contrast what the Savior taught His Apostles about true greatness: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; ...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. ... I am among you as he that serveth.<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[xi]</a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Jesus merited the greatest respect, honor, and deferential treatment of anyone who ever lived, yet he was content to "be as the younger" and one "that serveth." Think for a moment about the tireless service your own mother renders in your behalf. President McKay taught, <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The noblest calling in the world is motherhood</em>. True motherhood is the most beautiful of all arts, the greatest of all professions. She who can paint a masterpiece, or who can write a book that will influence millions, deserves the admiration and plaudits of mankind; but she who rears successfully a family of healthy, beautiful sons and daughters, whose immortal souls will exert an influence throughout the ages long after paintings shall have faded, and books and statues shall have decayed or have been destroyed, deserves the highest honor that man can give, and the choicest blessings of God. <br /><br />Motherhood is the one thing in all the world which most truly exemplifies the God-given virtues of creating and sacrificing.... No nobler work in this world can be performed by any mother than to rear and love the children with whom God has blessed her.<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[xii]</a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>I used to coach my oldest daughter's city-league basketball team. She was 9 or 10 at the time and was more interested in having fun and mingling with the other girls than in scoring a lot of points or even winning games. I tried, with mixed success, to teach the girls to dribble and shoot and pass and catch. Most of them were content to play minor roles and just enjoyed being part of a team. At our first game I realized very quickly that not all the parents were as content with that arrangement as their daughters were. I heard things from the stands like "Don't let her get away with that!" and "If she gets in your way again, knock her over!" I wasn't aware of this, but apparently it's important for little girls to learn how to growl, push, and throw a good elbow when they're nine if they want to be responsible, contributing adults and future mothers. <br /><br />Sometimes we send the message that aggression and superior self-confidence is the key to future success. Well, it just didn't feel right to me. I couldn't reconcile what I was hearing and seeing with anything the Savior taught. It wasn't until just recently that I read the following from Elder Maxwell: "If we truly want the best for our sons and daughters, we want for them not status but more meekness, mercy, love, patience, and submissiveness."<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[xiii]</a> I think this is especially true if we want them to be good mothers and fathers and disciples of Christ. <br /><br />I know what you're thinking. "Brother Venema, words like <em>meekness</em>, <em>mercy</em>, <em>love</em>, and <em>submissiveness</em> never show up on any sports apparel I've ever seen. No self-respecting rugby team in the world would wear jerseys that say, "The Meek Shall Inherit the Earth." That may be true, but those things go a long way in helping maintain marriages, family relationships, and genuine friendships. It's always a shame when those gospel-centered ideals are sacrificed on the altar of someone's selfish ambition or win-at-all-costs attitude. Imagine how embarrassed you would be if you showed up to the gates of heaven wearing a t-shirt that says "Eat my dust" or "Second place is the first loser." <br /><br />In 1989 Elder Dallin H. Oaks referred to a talk given much earlier by President J. Reuben Clark to remind the whole Church of an important principle: <br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In every great cause there are leaders and followers. In the wagon trains, the leaders were "out in front where the air was clear and clean and where they had unbroken vision of the blue vault of heaven." But, as President Clark observed, "Back in the last wagon, not always could they see the brethren way out in front and the blue heaven was often shut out from their sight by heavy, dense clouds of dust.... Yet day after day, they of the last wagon pressed forward, worn and tired, footsore, sometimes almost disheartened, borne up by their faith that God loved them, that the Restored Gospel was true, and that the Lord led and directed the brethren out in front." ... <br /><br />The fruits of the gospel issue from every honest and good heart, without regard to past origins or current positions in the Church....<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span> <br /><br />There are hidden heroines and heroes among the Latter-day Saints--"those of the last wagon" <em>whose fidelity to duty and devotion to righteousness go unnoticed by anyone except the One whose notice really matters</em>.<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[xiv]</a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Sometimes we seek to lead simply because it draws the attention of others to our service, and their praise and recognition is motivating to us. In both the Bible and the Book of Mormon, the Lord was critical of those who gave, prayed, and fasted "that they may be seen of men."<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[xv]</a> In both accounts, those who chose public recognition over secret service and worship missed the greater blessing that comes from a God who "seeth in secret."<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[xvi]</a> The Savior highlighted this attitude among the Pharisees to teach His Apostles an important leadership lesson: <br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant</em>.<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[xvii]</a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>One lesson for you and me is to be cautious how we feel about and use titles and offices in our church service and professional life. I'm not suggesting that you not show proper respect to those who are called to preside. You should address your bishop as "Bishop" and members of the stake presidency as "President," but when it comes to you and your service, it might be wise not to begin sentences with "When I was a ..." (insert whatever title applies--zone leader, Relief Society president, elders quorum president, etc.). It makes others who haven't held those positions uncomfortable and may be a symptom of a desire in you to be seen of men. Elder Marvin J. Ashton gave the following counsel: <br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Oftentimes when we dwell on where we have been and where we are now, and what we have now spiritually or financially, <em>we can create resentment rather than respect</em>....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When a man knowingly or unknowingly engages in self-exultation because of his riches, his political power, his worldly learning, his physical prowess, his business ability, or even his works of righteousness, he is not in tune with the Spirit of the Lord.<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[xviii]</a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>When you have a calling in the Church that requires you, by its nature, to be constantly busy and engaged in the service of others (like being a missionary, for instance) it can be difficult when the release comes. One day you were running as fast as you had strength, and the next day you find yourself at home wondering what normal people do on Tuesday nights. It wasn't long after it happened to me that I rediscovered these verses from D&amp;C Section 58: <br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward. <br /><br />Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; <br /><br />For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[xix]</a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>It dawned on me that perhaps the greater test of my discipleship was not how I served when I was compelled to serve in front of a congregation but how I would serve now when it was up to me to choose how I would spend my time. This may be where you are at the moment--compelled less by assignment and challenged more by your own agency. There are probably more of us in this situation at any given time than those serving in high positions requiring much, if not all, of their discretionary time. Perhaps this is why Elder Anderson challenged the whole Church at our most recent general conference to "pray often and sincerely for opportunities to stand as a witness of God."<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[xx]</a> Like we just sang in our opening hymn at this devotional, <br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are chances for work all around just now,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Opportunities right in our way.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do not let them pass by, saying, "Sometime I'll try," </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But go and do something today.<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[xxi]</a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>The question is, Will you be content to use your agency, regardless of your current calling, to testify, teach, heal, and bless those around you, and especially those of your own home? All of those things, by the way, can and should be done at home on a regular basis. They may not be seen or known to anyone but your own spouse and children but will likely have the most lasting effect. <br /><br />Elder Maxwell taught, <br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Developing greater contentment within certain of our existing constraints and opportunities is one of our challenges. Otherwise we may feel underused, underwhelmed, and underappreciated--while, ironically, within our givens are unused opportunities for service all about us.... <em>There is so much to do within what has been allotted to us</em>. Furthermore, varied as our allotted circumstances may be, we can still keep the commandments of God! ... <br /><br />Thus "the holy present" contains the allotted acres for our discipleship. We need not be situated in prime time with prime visibility in order to work out our own salvation!<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[xxii]</a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Consider for a moment your "holy present." Who is in your current circle of influence? What are your present assignments? Think about why the Lord may have placed you there, with those people. Those roommates. Those friends. Those classmates. This town. This university. This ward. Now, what questions could you ask the Lord that would help you be a better disciple right now, where you are? Imagine if you woke up every morning and asked, "Who needs me today? Whom can I bless?" How about "How can I be a more effective home or visiting teacher?" or "How can I be a better daughter or son, husband or wife, father or mother?" If we assume that we are on the Lord's errand all the time, no matter where we are or whom we are with, and if we are always looking for opportunities to testify, heal, and bless, then becoming a "success" is a foregone conclusion. <br /><br />President Monson exemplifies this better than anyone I know. He said, "The sweetest experience I know in life is to feel a prompting and act upon it and later find out that it was the fulfillment of someone's prayer or someone's need. And I always want the Lord to know that if He needs an errand run, Tom Monson will run that errand for Him."<a href="/devotionals/greg-venema#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[xxiii]</a> Imagine how blessed our families, our neighbors, and our wards would be if we all had the same attitude as our prophet, if we were all truly willing to go to whomever and go whenever the Lord needed, regardless of who noticed. I've found that often the best errand I can run is downstairs to work on a school project, or outside to the basketball hoop or the swing set, or to a child's room to seek forgiveness or to offer a blessing. <br /><br />I would like to be the kind of person that serves wherever the Lord needs me. Sometimes that has been up front, and sometimes it has been in places barely noticed. The trick is to be as happy and enthusiastic and as committed to serve in obscurity as you are in more prominent places with large audiences and the accompanying accolades. This is especially true in the most important and often most obscure field of all--the home. <br /><br />This is my family. Aren't they adorable! I'm the chubby one in the middle. One thing I know for sure is that this is where I cannot fail. These are the people who need my best efforts. They should get the most love, the best teaching, receive the greatest benefit from my priesthood, and be most comforted by my protection and vigilance. I testify that, truly, "no other success can compensate for failure in the home." I'm keenly aware of it now at age 47. I wish I had thought more deeply about it when I was 23. I think if I had, I would've been less distracted seeking success in other, less-important places. <br /><br />May the Lord bless you as you strive for more committed discipleship wherever you happen to be right now, and especially in your home with your family. I know the Lord knows who you are and where you are and that He will lead you by the hand and give you answers to your prayers, especially as you ask the right questions. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>Thank you, President and Sister Gilbert and BYU-Idaho, for the opportunity to share some thoughts today. As always, the music has invited the Holy Ghost to teach and edify us.<br /><br /> <strong>Outcomes &amp; Objectives</strong><br />The objective today is to help you recognize and embrace incompetence as part of your progression in being perfected in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; <br /><br />On an average Rexburg summer day, my family went out for a drive exploring the back roads of Madison County. There was, of course, the wind and sun, and it was dry and dusty. We drove up and down the dirt roads of the potato farms. It can be fun with three children under five in car seats. The ride was an inexpensive roller coaster, a thrill ride that suddenly came to a stop with a thump-thump-thump. I pulled the new-to-us minivan over to the side of the dirt road and discovered that we had a flat tire. <br /><br />We got the three children out of the van. We moved the children well off to the side of the road, where my wife could safely watch them. I began the process of changing the tire. I found the jack under the front hood, but I could not find the spare tire. It never occurred to me that I didn't know how to find the tire on our new van until I found myself needing the information. It was frustrating not to know. I looked for removable panels anywhere I could think of but still could not find the spare tire. Confused, I resorted to the user manual. It took a few minutes to discover that the spare was located underneath the van, a location that I had not considered. <br /><br />With a few more minutes invested in studying the drivers manual, I found that the spare tire could be lowered using a bolt mechanism in the back of the van. By using the handle of the jack, I turned the bolt, and the tire descended from the secret location. <br /><br />I began turning the bolt and let the cable out until the tire reached the ground. As soon as the tire touched the ground, I reached underneath the van and tried to get it. It only came partway out. It was then that I realize that I hadn't let out enough cable to remove the tire. I returned to the bolt mechanism and let out enough cable to get the tire all the way out from under the van.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From this point, changing the tire veered into familiar territory: loosening lug nuts, jacking up the vehicle, removing the flat tire, replacing the tire with the spare, lug nuts, lowering the jack, and tightening the lug nuts. <br /><br />Once the tire was on, we were ready to go. I put the flat tire and the tools in the back of the van, buckled all three children back into their car seats, situated myself behind the wheel, and started off once again exploring the back-road roller coaster of Madison County. <br /><br />Not far down the road, there was a metallic clinking sound. I looked in my mirrors and discovered that I was dragging the spare-tire cable. The hardware that held the spare tire in place was bouncing down the road like an action figure in <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em>. Once again, I pulled over, found the jack handle, and reeled in the cable. Now we were off to finish our ride. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Finding out what we need to know </strong><strong></strong> <br />If you had asked me before the drive if I knew how to change the tire, I would have confidently answered, "Yes." Luckily there was a manual to help me solve the challenge, but the lack of information was a weakness that I didn't know I had. <br /><br />For us the Lord has provided the scriptures as a life manual. There is a scripture that relates to learning about our weakness that I have heard over my lifetime and I am sure many of you know: "And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness" (Ether 12:27). <br /><br />Let's stop there for now. This is a scripture that I honestly have struggled to like. Here is my imperfect translation: "What next? I am already overwhelmed and know all too clearly where I am falling short." <br /><br />Elder J. Devn Cornish of the Seventy said in the most recent general conference, "Sometimes when we attend church, we become discouraged even by sincere invitations to improve ourselves. We think silently, 'I can't do all these things' or 'I will never be as good as all these people.'"<em></em> <br /><br />I have experienced these kinds of feelings throughout my life. I try to be a good person and live a life following the commandments of God. How could I live a worthy life without feeling so incompetent? <br /><br />The beginnings of my answer came to me just a few years ago through a magazine article that my wife read in the waiting room of a doctor's office. It was a short paragraph about the four stages of learning. That afternoon, as we drove home, she shared the idea, and it changed the way I viewed my weakness and incompetence (<a href="http://www.gordontraining.com/free-workplace-articles/learning-a-new-skill-is-easier-said-than-done/">http://www.gordontraining.com/free-workplace-articles/learning-a-new-skill-is-easier-said-than-done/</a>). <br /><br />Once again, I became aware of something I did not know I needed to know. <br /><br />Four stages of competence: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Unconscious incompetence </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Conscious incompetence </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Conscious competence </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Unconscious competence</p>
<p>Let's briefly define each of these. <br /><br />Unconscious incompetence: The individual does not understand or know how to do something and does not necessarily recognize the deficit. An example of this is a small child sitting behind the steering wheel of a parked car pretending to drive.<strong></strong> <br /><br />Conscious incompetence: Though the individual does not understand or know how to do something, he or she does recognize the deficit. This is like the first day of driver's education. Everything is new, and it takes all your brainpower to operate the vehicle.<strong></strong> <br /><br />Conscious competence: The individual understands or knows how to do something. However, demonstrating the skill or knowledge requires concentration. This is like the last day of driver's education. You have improved in your driving but find yourself rehearsing driving rules to yourself as you drive. <br /><br />Unconscious competence: The individual has had so much practice with a skill that it has become "second nature." To complete the driving example, after several months of driving, everything seems natural, and there is no conscious effort needed. The focus is on where you need to go, not how to operate the vehicle.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">Unconscious Incompetence<br /></strong>Unconscious incompetence is a state of innocence. Young children are an example of this kind of behavior. They live and play for the fun of it: dancing, singing, sports, and drawing, to name a few.</p>
<p>This stage in the learning process is pretty challenging because you don't know what you need to know. All of us today are in the state of unconscious incompetence. There are things in each of our lives that need to be improved, but before the improvement can begin, we need to be conscious of our personal incompetence. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Conscious Incompetence</strong><br />Here are a few examples of the transition to conscious incompetence:</p>
<p>For an art major, it may have something to do with successes that they have already experienced:</p>
<p>Then they register for school at BYU-Idaho and choose art as their major. Eventually they have their first critique, and it can be a bummer. The student may wonder, "What happened?" "I thought I was pretty good." "My mom likes my work." <br /><br />Times like these are moments of decision, to quit or continue. The student may doubt the authentic nature of their previous experience. In truth, their experience is authentic; there is just more to learn. They begin learning things that they did not know that they needed to know. <br /><br />These moments of decision are like getting kicked out of the Garden of Eden. It is conscious incompetence. It is the moment that they become aware that there are right and wrong ways to do something. <br /><br />"And after Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of Eden, to till the earth" (2 Nephi 2:19). <br /><br />"To till the earth" is a way of saying that we will have to work for what we get. <br /><br />Wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin. <br /><br />But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy. (2 Nephi 2:23-25) <br /><br />Being unaware is not the path to joy. The path to joy goes directly through conscious incompetence. Becoming better is a process. <br /><br />In the example of the art major, their previous experience is wonderful, valid, and good. It just so happens that there is more to learn. There is more to become. <br /><br />There is more to joy than moving to the state of conscious competence. Conscious competence is knowing how to do something and doing it well, but we know that we have help in achieving our righteous desires. Returning to Ether 12:27, "And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them." <br /><br />Let me read part of that again: "My grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them."<br /><br />After being cast out of the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve were not left without a way to develop, become, and overcome. A Savior was provided. We have the same blessing. The greatest gift we have comes, as Ether says, "in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things" (2 Nephi 2:24). We have been given a Savior who atoned perfectly for our sins. He has already made it possible for us to overcome physical and spiritual death and return to our heavenly home. We believe in learning by study and by faith. The steps of learning infer that you can do it all by yourself, but we know that we need the Savior for eternal salvation. <br /><br />As with anything in life, eternal salvation is not something we earn in one big action. It is something we become by small steps over time, one step at a time through the grace of Jesus Christ. <br /><br />In 2 Nephi we read, "For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have" (2 Nephi 28:30).<br /><br />Once again, eternal salvation is not something we earn; it is something we become one step at a time through the grace of Jesus Christ. <br /><br />When we find ourselves in a state of conscious incompetence, in order to grow we must exercise our agency. We make a choice to continue learning line upon line, or we may say, "We have enough." "From them shall be taken away even that which they have." <br /><br />Exercising faith in Jesus Christ is an act of humility, trust, and hope. All of our efforts to become better in this life extend into the next life through exercising faith in the grace of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Elder David A. Bednar said, "True faith is focused in and on the Lord and always leads to righteous action. 'Faith [in Christ is] the first principle in revealed religion, ... the foundation of all righteousness, ... and the principle of action in all intelligent beings<strong>.'"<em> </em></strong><br /><br />One of my favorite teachings from the Book of Mormon is found in Alma 32:28:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.</p>
<p>This scripture describes exercising faith in a state of conscious incompetence. "Planting the seed" is a part of any endeavor that we wish to pursue. To be a good piano player, it takes practice and patience. Choosing a major in school is an act of planting a seed of faith. It is a hope to one day be a scientist, entrepreneur, painter, musician, mathematician, dancer, designer, or any number of other options. <br /><br />School is an organized series of experiences that have proven effective in helping students gain skills, understanding, and ways of thinking to become a contributing member of a profession. <br /><br />The experiences are necessary in order to become. While the process can be designed and followed, the final results cannot be gifted. For example, I cannot give my art students the ability to be a designer. It is through their individual efforts and struggles that they become a designer. In the beginning, there are challenges, disappointments, and successes. <br /><br />Referring back to Alma 32, we are taught, "But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow" (Alma 32:30).<em> </em><br /><br />Here are some of the ways we can nourish and grow the seed of faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This list is not new. In fact, it is a list of Sunday School answers. Instead of disregarding these basic answers, ponder for a moment what they mean. Have you ever wondered what all of these answers have in common? Why are they important actions in becoming a better son or daughter of God? There is a clue in Mosiah 18:10:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?"</p>
<p>All of the Sunday School answers place us in physical or spiritual places where the Holy Ghost can influence our lives. All baptized members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been exhorted to actively seek and use the Spirit in their lives. <br /><br />The exhortation comes at the time of confirmation, when hands are placed upon your head and a priesthood holder says these words: "I say unto you, receive the Holy Ghost."</p>
<p><strong>Conscious competence<br /></strong>After gaining some understanding and practice, you transition to the state of conscious competence, which is when the individual understands or knows how to do something; however, demonstrating the skill or knowledge requires concentration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life" (Alma 32:41).<em></em> <br /><br />Actively participating in an experience is one way to learn. As members of the Church, we have experiences provided for us to grow and develop. These experiences are opportunities to develop. Sometimes we might feel that if we can't do it right, we won't do it at all. <br /><br />I had an experience as a high counselor where I was asked to help set apart new leaders in a high priest group. It was one of those moments where it was too late to consult a book for the proper words and process. I had been present at many setting aparts but had never done it myself. I was nervous as I listened carefully to the stake president set apart the group leader. Now it was my turn to set apart one of the counselors. Very nervous, with halting and a few stumbles, I made it through the blessing. <br /><br />What I didn't expect to discover was a lesson in priesthood leadership, but I did. I learned it through the actions of the good stake president. Throughout the blessing, the stake president stood next to me as I did my best. I was worried that the stake president would be unhappy with my current skill level. However, he remained calm, didn't jump in and correct, and didn't seem nervous. He didn't expect me to be perfect. His calmness and action let me know that my best was good enough. <br /><br />His inferred confidence provided an opportunity to grow. <br /><br />When the Savior was on the earth, He taught that He must go away in order for the Comforter to come. This was a very difficult time for the Apostles and fledgling members of Christ's Church. In order for them to grow, they each needed to have the opportunity to make decisions and act. <br /><br />In John 16:7, the Savior said, "Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you." <br /><br />We need experiences to grow. Sometimes the learning comes when you are the only one to count on to get something done. This was the case when I was required to change the flat tire. If someone with the required skill had changed the tire, I would still be lacking the necessary experience. <br /><br />We can learn from Joseph Smith's experience in Liberty Jail: "And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;C 122:7). <br /><br />I am a cancer survivor and have faced the pain and suffering that comes with the experience. Liver transplant was part of the treatment. This is a photo of me the day before and the day after the liver transplant. <br /><br /> <img alt="Hospital photos" height="215" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202016/Graphics/Hospital_Photos_300x215.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />I will forever be grateful to an unknown organ donor and their family for their selfless act in a time of personal sorrow. They gave me new life. The experience of cancer and transplant is one of the most challenging I have faced. Over a period of years, I was almost always in pain. I heard the teaching that the Savior can take away our pain. I truly wondered, "What about my pain?" While there was hope in the plan of salvation, my pain was not removed. One place that I did find comfort was talking to others who had had similar experiences. It was during one of these conversations that I finally discovered something that I did not know I needed to know. The Savior didn't take away my pain, but He completely understood my pain. This opened the door to let me see that all those who struggle with any suffering or sin have someone that they can turn to who perfectly knows their experience. <br /><br />Alma teaches us, "And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities" (Alma 7:12).<em></em> <br /><br />The Savior has experienced your deepest pain and understands exactly what you need. If you have suffered, He has felt it. You will still suffer; He has felt that as well. He knows the pain, suffering, and sin of all. His atoning sacrifice is infinite and complete. He has paid the price in full.<em></em> <br /><br />One phrase that we can't use with the Savior is "You just wouldn't understand," because no matter what it is, He does understand. <br /><br />While we can't understand as the Savior does, we can understand others more clearly based on our personal experience. We become more like the Savior as we seek to obey His commandments. <br /><br />Obeying the commandments in a state of conscious competence can at times seem like we are obeying them for the wrong reason, because the "how" we do something seems to get in the way of the "why" we do something. Don't be discouraged if you feel that you are just obeying the rules. <br /><br />Elder Bednar taught, "Repetition is a vehicle through which the Holy Ghost can enlighten our minds, influence our hearts, and enlarge our understanding." <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Unconscious Competence</strong><strong></strong> <br />The final stage of learning is unconscious competence, which is when the individual has had so much practice with a skill that it has become "second nature." This state is the goal because actions that we have worked on become automatic. <br /><br />"And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst" (Alma 32:42).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br /></strong>On another night, I found myself back in my van headed for the emergency room at the University of Utah. It was rainy, cold, and dark. It was one of those wet nights where the water on the road seemed to absorb all of the light from the headlights. My wife was driving, and I was doing my best to distract myself from the pain. As we rounded the curve on the highway in Utah near Lagoon, we started to hear a thump-thump-thump. It became apparent that we once again had a flat tire. The tire needed to be fixed. I was able to change the tire in less than 10 minutes. I even knew that I needed to retract the cable.</p>
<p>This experience was humbling in a different way. I learned something that I did not know I needed to know. I understood that "all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things." I was given the opportunity to learn how to change a tire on a pleasant day, with full health, so I could change a tire on a rainy night with compromised health. The Lord blessed me with knowledge that He knew I needed to have.<strong></strong> <br /><br />There is joy in conscious incompetence when we recognize that it is part of the learning process. I know that this life provides life experiences that help us become more through the grace of Jesus Christ. He loves and understands you perfectly. Experiences are customized for you in the wisdom of Him who knoweth all things. Today's challenge may be a great blessing for tomorrow. <br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>While growing up in the '80s, I was fascinated with Wonder Woman. I would watch her show and then go to my backyard to practice a variety of stunts and maneuvers I might be called upon to use in a precarious situation. I can't begin to tell you how empowered I felt when I wore my Wonder Woman shirt. I just felt like I could do so much good! My eight-year-old brain started to think, "If I can accomplish this much good while wearing my Wonder Woman T-shirt, how much good could I accomplish if Heavenly Father would allow me to be Wonder Woman?" So I began to pray, very fervently, numerous times a day, that Heavenly Father would allow me to be Wonder Woman; and while I was praying, I would promise Heavenly Father that I would "only use my powers for good!" After weeks and months of praying and no obvious transformation, I started to have some heart-to-heart talks with my mom about how prayers are answered. During one of our last conversations, my mom said, "Maybe Heavenly Father doesn't need you to be Wonder Woman; maybe he just needs you to be Kynda." How disappointing! I'm just going to be myself? That's no good! But this answer pacified me, and I moved out of the superhero developmental phase and on to another one. <br /><br /> A few years ago I was telling a friend about my Wonder Woman experience, and she told another friend, and the two of them purchased a Wonder Woman keychain for me. When they were presenting me with the keychain, my friend said, "We think you are Wonder Woman!" At that moment, I felt an electrical zing move from the top of my head down to my feet, and I felt this impression on my heart and mind: "You got to be her. You got to be Wonder Woman." My immediate reaction to this impression was, "No, I haven't! I haven't saved anyone from a burning building or stopped a speeding train!" But as I continued to process the impression I received, I began to realize what heroes <em>really</em> do: they help people. <br /><br />There is a modern fable of a young man who is walking along the ocean and sees a beach on which thousands and thousands of starfish have washed ashore. Further along, he sees an old man walking slowly and stooping often, picking up one starfish after another and tossing each one gently into the ocean. <br /><br />"Why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?" the young man asks. <br />"Because the sun is up and the tide is going out, and if I don't throw them further in, they will die." <br />"But there must be thousands of starfish. You can't possibly save them all. In fact, even if you work all day, your efforts won't make any difference at all." <br /><br />The old man listened calmly and then bent down to pick up another starfish and threw it into the ocean. "It made a difference to that one" (<a href="http://www.esc16.net/users/0020/FACES/Starfish%20Story.pdf">http:// Wonder Womanw.esc16.net/users/0020/FACES/Starfish%20Story.pdf</a>). <br /><br />I want you to identify a person in your life that has had a real and positive impact on your development. Are you thinking of someone? Now I want you to identify some behaviors exhibited by this person or identify interactions you had with this person. While some of you may be thinking of sports stars or other media figures, I'm guessing that most of you identified someone you have a personal relationship with--maybe a family member, coach, teacher, coworker, or a friend. <br /><br />Today I would like to propose that our Heavenly Father's definition of a hero is fundamentally different than the world's definition. One of the curious side effects of the sensationalized media is that when we hear about a heroic person, we have a dual reaction of awe and intimidation. At the same moment we're thinking, "He's amazing! She's amazing!" we are also thinking, "But I can't swim in the Olympics like Katie Ledecky or survive in Afghanistan like U.S. Navy Seal Marcus Lattrell. I'm not capable of heroic acts." <br /><br />Even more curious is that we tend to have this same reaction with the scriptures. We are in awe of Nephi, Enos, and Captain Moroni, but we are simultaneously intimidated by them. We believe we are not capable of their acts of faith--that what Nephi and Enos accomplished is <em>beyond</em> what we can accomplish. Let's see if this is true. <br /><br />1 Nephi 17:8-10:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters.<br /><br />And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me?<br /><br />And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go to find ore, that I might make tools.</p>
<p>In this passage, Nephi asks questions, he gets answers, and he follows directions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In Enos 1:4, Enos is talking here. He says, "And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens." <br /><br />So Enos prayed. The next scriptural reference is about Captain Moroni and the title of liberty. Just before the verse I'm going to share, Captain Moroni has just said, "In memory of our God, our religion, our [freedom and peace], our wives, and our children" (Alma 46:12). <br /><br />Then in Alma 46:28 it says, "And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words he went forth, and also sent forth in all the parts of the land where there were dissensions, and gathered together all the people who were desirous to maintain their liberty, to stand against Amalickiah and those who had dissented, who were called Amalickiahites." In this passage, Captain Moroni took leadership opportunities. <br /><br />In Mormon 1:1 it says, "And now I, Mormon, make a record of the things which I have both seen and heard, and call it the Book of Mormon." Mormon kept a journal. <br /><br />Our final passage is my favorite example. In the first few verses of 1 Nephi, chapter five, Nephi and his brothers have just returned from Jerusalem, where they obtained the brass plates. I will read verses one, two, and six.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that after we had come down into the wilderness unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and also my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had mourned because of us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also had complained against my father, telling him that he was a visionary man; saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort my mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of the Jews.</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> this passage because it <em>humanizes</em> Sariah and Lehi. Sariah was a regular, worried mom. If my husband, Eric, had guided me and my kids out on some relocation camping expedition for months on end and then sent my sons, Harrison and Davis, back on some secret mission to confront a bad person, I would be worried too! I would complain too! I also like how, in verse six, Lehi comforts Sariah and sets an example of what husband and wife should do for each other. They <em>should</em> be talking to each other. They <em>should</em> be comforting each other. In the end, Sariah is a regular person. She is faithful. She is strong. She is resilient, and she is human! <br /><br />So let's recap and humanize these different examples. We can follow directions and build things (like Nephi), we can pray (like Enos), we can take leadership opportunities, we can write in a journal, and we can do hard things. We are more like Nephi, Enos, Captain Moroni, Mormon, Sariah, and Lehi than we realize. They were <em>regular people</em> who were willing to maintain a relationship with the Lord and do what they were asked to do. You and I are <em>regular people</em> who are willing to maintain a relationship with God and do what we are asked to do! We are and can continue to be just like our Book of Mormon heroes! So if Heavenly Father's definition of a hero is fundamentally different than the world's definition, what makes up a&nbsp;<br />hero in our Father's eyes? While there are potentially numerous qualities, today I would like to propose two: the first quality is consistency, and the second is taking baby steps. <br /><br />Think again of the person you identified as having an impact on your development. I'm guessing that one of their most appealing qualities is that they provided you with some kind of consistent support or guidance that was <em>well paced</em>. In other words, the support provided was neither overwhelming nor underwhelming. In most cases, I'm guessing their support was "just right." I'd like to share an example of pacing. <br /><br />A few years ago, I had a unique opportunity. In April of 2013, I got to run in the Boston Marathon. In order to run the Boston, you have to earn the <em>right</em> to run it by successfully completing a qualifying marathon in the year prior to the Boston. Qualifying times are adjusted based on your age and gender. My designated qualifying time was 3 hours and 45 minutes, which translates to an average pace of about 8-and-a-half-minute miles. I tried to qualify for the Boston in the Top of Utah Marathon in Logan, Utah, in 2011 but missed my qualifying time by 46 seconds. While I was disappointed, I continued to train throughout the winter. I changed <em>one key</em> strategy and then ran the Ogden Marathon in May 2012. This time I met my qualifying time with a few minutes to spare. <br /><br />So what was the strategy that ultimately contributed to my qualification? I changed my pacing. In my first qualification attempt--the Top of Utah Marathon--my strategy was to go out and run as fast as I could. <br /><br /> <img alt="First Marathon Photo" height="220" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202016/Graphics/First-Marathon-Photo_300x220.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />My husband, Eric, who is a fast and accomplished runner in his own right, ran out in front of me, and I did my best to stay right behind him. It felt amazing for the first half of the race. We were flying down the mountain and passing people right and left, but unfortunately this strategy came with a price. By the halfway point, I had expended most of my energy and ended up having very little energy to complete the race, let alone meet my qualifying time. <br /><br /> Eight months later, in the Ogden Marathon, I changed my approach. <br /><br /> <img alt="Second Marathon Photo" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202016/Graphics/Second-Marathon-Photo_230x300.jpg" width="230" /> <br /><br />I promised myself that I would not allow myself to run faster than an eight-minute mile pace. There were several times during the race that I would look down at my GPS, and I was going too fast. I had to make myself slow down. This was really hard! It's hard to allow people to pass you when you know you are capable of running fast too. But the goal is not to <em>just</em> run fast; the goal is to endure to the end. By slowing down the pace just a little, I increased my endurance. My new strategy paid off, just like the classic fable about a tortoise and a hare. The hare runs in short, distracted bursts. The tortoise is slower but more consistent in pacing, and the consistency ends up winning the race. <br /><br />How often in life do we approach a new activity, calling, or task with so much initial zeal and excitement that we end up expending all of our energy at the beginning and have nothing left to give at the end? Consistency is a key in any responsibility: planting a garden, maintaining an exercise plan, fulfilling a calling, being a spouse and parent, going to college, and saving for retirement, just to name a few. <br /><br />We need to plan to endure to the end. In the 13th Article of Faith it says, "Indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul--We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things." <br /><br />In D&amp;C 10:4 it says, "Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength... but be diligent unto the end." The Lord expects us to be mindful of our pacing. Consistent support and guidance is typically superior to intermittent bursts of support. <br /><br />My family moved into North Canyon Sixth Ward in Bountiful, Utah, when I was 15 years old. I was blessed by my Mia Maid and Laurel leaders: Mary, Liz, Debbie, and Bonnie. While I cannot remember <em>any</em> specific lesson they taught me, I do remember that they were happy, loving, patient, persistent, and consistent. Now I have a 15-year-old daughter, and I am so very grateful that she has YW leaders who <em>have</em> all of those same qualities, but mostly that their consistent support is "just right." True heroes are consistent. <br /><br />The second quality of a divine hero is taking baby steps. Just before I ran the Boston Marathon, friends and family who knew about the race would ask me a variety of questions. However, one of their questions kept tripping me up. Every once in a while, a person would ask this question: "How long do you expect the race to take?" I would answer that I was hoping to come in under four hours. When I would audibly hear myself say "four hours," my chest would start to tighten, my heart would start to race, and I would get light-headed. After experiencing this reaction a few times, I had to check myself. I had to give myself a time-out and think through my physiological response to my comment. As I processed this experience, I realized that I felt daunted by the idea of running for four hours. Four hours? That's a really long time! I don't know if I can run for four hours! Now, keep in mind, by that point I had run several marathons under the four-hour mark, but I just wasn't sure if I could do it again. I finally decided to change my focus. Since I wasn't <em>positive</em> that I could run the Boston in under four hours, I would focus on putting one foot in front of the other, and I would keep doing that for 26.2 miles. Once I changed my focus, I could relax and enjoy the race. <br /><br />While it's good to have long-term goals, sometimes the "big picture" becomes overwhelming and/or intimidating. In these cases, we should break down the big picture into more manageable goals--baby steps. How are you going to complete a one-and-a-half or two-year mission? I don't know exactly how you are going to do that, but here's what we do know. You can get up on time each morning, and you can study when you are supposed to study and make contacts when you are supposed to be out working with the people. And you can do that every day until your time is up. <br /><br />How are you going to complete a degree here at BYU-Idaho? Again, I'm not sure exactly how you're going to do it, but here's what we do know. You can attend your classes and contribute to your classmates' learning, you can study each day, you can turn in assignments, you can study for tests, and pretty soon you'll have a degree. If this semester as a whole is too daunting to consider, shrink your focus down to this month, this week, or even just today. Today you will be to class on time. Today you will study for two hours, and so on. <br /><br />How are you and I going to make it to the celestial kingdom? I don't know exactly how we will accomplish this, but I do know that we can get up each morning and be kind and patient and watch what we say and work hard and be loving. If we don't do a great job today, we'll repent and try again tomorrow. And eventually, we <em>will</em> make it to the celestial kingdom. This is a fairly new concept to me. I did grow up in the Church, but as a child I found it upsetting to talk about the celestial kingdom because I knew my weaknesses and I never thought I would be good enough. But a few years ago, I was in a stake Relief Society meeting, and our wise Stake Relief Society president, Christy Syndergaard, said, and I quote, "You are going to make it to the celestial kingdom! Is it possible you won't? Yes, it's possible but not likely. You are going to make it!" I remember sitting in that chapel listening to Sister Syndergaard and being both surprised and relieved to hear those words spoken so plainly. <br /><br />Those same words were shared by Elder J. Devn Cornish in this last general conference. He said, "Let me be direct and clear. The answers to the questions 'Am I good enough?' and 'Will I make it?' are 'Yes! You are going to be good enough' and 'Yes, you are going to make it as long as you keep repenting and do not rationalize or rebel.'" Elder Cornish went on to say, "I love the way President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley used to teach this principle. I heard him say on several occasions, 'Brothers and sisters, all the Lord expects of us is to try, but you have to <em>really</em> try!' 'Really trying' means doing the best we can, recognizing where we need to improve, and then trying again. By repeatedly doing this, we <em>come</em> closer and closer to the Lord, we feel His Spirit more and more, and we receive more of His grace, or help." <br /><br />We may feel that we are not good enough, but we are trying! And the reality is, we are exactly where we need to be right now. Years ago when my second daughter, Nelah, was in kindergarten, she was given a stencil to work with at school. She used this stencil to make me a sign. She brought the sign home and proudly presented it to me. The sign says, "Kynda is lfbut." <br /><br /> <img alt="../../../Volumes/DevotionalGraphics/2016%20Fall/Kynda%20Roberts/Images/Nelah'" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202016/Graphics/Card_300x200.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />I was initially confused. Was she trying to say that I had a fluffy bum? While I was racking my brain trying to figure out what Nelah could mean by this, she said, with a huge smile on her face, "See, Mom. It says 'Kynda is beautiful.'" Aaah, yes, I see it now. "Beautiful" is a difficult word to spell. My five-year-old Nelah had sounded it out and spelled the word phonetically for me. When she ran out of room at the end of the line, she finished the word in the empty space at the beginning of the line, hence "lfbut." During this interaction with Nelah, there was <em>no</em> part of me that was worried for Nelah's spelling ability. I wasn't thinking, "Oh no! Nelah spelled 'beautiful' wrong! Now she's not going to graduate from high school or go to college!" No! Although she did <em>not</em> spell "beautiful" correctly, she was completely developmentally appropriate for her age. She was exactly where she was supposed to be at that time! I knew that <em>eventually</em> Nelah would learn how to spell "beautiful" correctly--and she has. Heavenly Father feels the <em>same way</em> about us! When we make mistakes, I don't think he is saying, "Well, Kynda has really messed up now. I don't think she is going to be able to endure to the end and return back to me." No! I bet He is thinking that you and I are exactly where we need to be at this point in our development: we are learning, and we are on the path to perfection. True heroes take baby steps. <br /><br />The prophet Isaiah said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.&nbsp;(Isaiah 41:10, 13)</p>
<p>As we evaluate how to apply consistency and baby steps in our own lives and in the lives of others, think <em>small</em>, not big. The world will lead us to believe that the only things worth doing are the big things, but "by small and simple things are great things brought to pass" (Alma 37:6). One of the surprises of parenting for me has been how euphoric it feels to watch my kids be productive. After years of being pregnant and nursing, and wiping poop off of bums and mucus off of noses, and making job lists, and making sure they finish those job lists, and reading the scriptures, and holding FHE, and shuttling them around from place to place, <em>now</em> we are starting to see some of the payoff. <br /><br />Last month we watched our two older children run and place at the state cross-country meet. Harrison is a senior at Skyline High School in Idaho Falls, and Adria is a freshman at the same school. A few days later, we watched these same two children play a piano duet at their younger brother's baptism. Never in those 10 collective years of changing diapers did I realize what all of those tiny, little acts of service and assistance would add up too. <br /><br />And as parents, our contribution is only part of the puzzle. My kids have grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins who have guided and supported them. There have been Primary, youth, and Scout leaders. There have been piano, organ, and band teachers. There have been basketball, soccer, swim, and track coaches, and now a cross-country coach who loves them and guides them and who isn't afraid to correct them. As I look at my children, I realize that <em>hundreds of people</em> have been willing to contribute to their lives in a million little ways. <br /><br />One of those little contributions was made by a student here on our campus. Parker Kuhn was a member of our family ward in Idaho Falls, and he is now a student living in Rexburg. When our son was a freshman, he was completing his Eagle Scout project. As part of the project, the young men of the ward were going to help Harrison by passing out flyers for a shoe drive. Harrison had planned out what he needed to do and bring to the activity but ended up forgetting the tape for the flyers. When I realized he left the tape behind, I drove around the neighborhood to all of the groups of boys who were handing out flyers to give them a roll of tape. I caught up to Parker and his friend and handed them the tape and thanked them for their willingness to help Harrison. Parker's two-word response to my gratitude has been forever seared in my brain. When I thanked Parker, he responded with, "My pleasure." How do we respond when we are given the opportunity to assist another? At that time, Parker was a senior in high school, and I'm sure he had a hundred other things he could have been doing, but he took one hour out of his day to help our son earn his Eagle. <br /><br />The song "Glorious" from <em>Meet the Mormons</em> teaches us about our impact on the world. This life experience isn't all about you or all about me, but we can play a part. My favorite lines from the song say, "Everyone plays a piece, and there are melodies in each one of us. Pretty soon you'll start to figure out <em>your</em> part." When we look for opportunities to make a contribution, think small. Smile at the cashier at the grocery store. Invite your roommate to join you for an activity. <em>Really</em> listen to a friend. Invite a classmate to study with you. Write a thank-you note. Choose to look for the good in someone else. Reach out to a family member. The Church has introduced a simple service program for this Christmas season called Light the World. The idea is to look for simple ways to serve those around us each day. The theme is "Light the world in 25 ways over 25 days." You can visit Mormon.org for daily themes and ideas to get started. By small and simple things are great things brought to pass. <br /><br />Frederick Buechner, an American writer and Presbyterian minister, said, "Compassion is ... the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy <em>for me</em> until there is peace and joy <em>finally for you</em> too." (Buechner, F., 1994, "Spelling out the Truth," <em>Third Way</em>, 17, 5.) <br /><br />I want you to know that Heavenly Father answered my eight-year-old prayers. He did allow me to be Wonder Woman, but not one from the comic strips and the TV shows. I got to be a daughter and a sister. I am a student and a teacher. I am a wife and a mother. I am a barber and a taxi driver. I am a runner and a referee. I am a visiting teacher and a friend. Heavenly Father didn't need me to be the media version of a superhero. He just needed me to be myself. While this prospect was initially disappointing to the eight-year-old Kynda, I have come to realize that the Lord just wants us to keep trying, keep repenting, keep improving, and realize our own <em>personal</em> potential. Throughout my life, I have been gradually changing my definition of a hero, moving away from the media version and moving closer to our Father's definition. As my own definition has evolved, I have asked myself numerous times throughout my life, did I keep my promise to Heavenly Father? Have I "only used my powers for good?" <em>Do you use your powers for good?</em> There is heroism inside each of us, but not the heroism from the news and movies. It's Heavenly Father's version of a hero. I pray that we can apply consistency and baby steps as we become the children, siblings, spouses, parents, students, and friends that our Heavenly Father needs us to be. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Physics Faculty Member</p>
<p>Born in Driggs, Idaho to Elmo and Verna Tonks, William Brian Tonks grew up in Victor, Idaho.&nbsp; <br /><br />He received an associate degree from Ricks College, and a bachelor's degree in Physics from BYU. <br /><br /> He served in the U.S. Naval Reserves for 5 years, and was on active duty in the U.S. Navy for 5 years. <br /><br />Brian taught at the Naval Nuclear Power School and went from there to the University of Arizona to earn a PhD in Planetary Science, where he researched several aspects of the origin of the earth and moon.&nbsp; <br /><br />He began teaching in the Physics Department at BYU-Idaho in 1993.&nbsp; He served as Physics Department Chair from 2002-2007. <br /><br />Brother Tonks served in the Arkansas Little Rock Mission.&nbsp; He has also been, among other things, a Sunday School teacher, ward mission leader, military group leader, bishop's counselor, nursery leader with his wife, and most recently, bishop of the Rexburg YSA 19<sup>th</sup> ward.&nbsp; <br /><br />Brian and his wife, Nancy, have been married for 35 years. Three of their four children have attended BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; They also have 10 grandchildren.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I express thanks to President Gilbert and his staff for this opportunity to speak and their kindness this day. I also thank the choir for inviting the Spirit into this devotional. Few things invite the Spirit more strongly than sacred music. I express appreciation for my sweet wife, Nancy, and her unfailing support. I deeply appreciate our sweet companionship over these past 35 years. I appreciate my family and colleagues for their support. I also express my appreciation to you for coming to this devotional. You are where the Lord wants you to be during this time, and I commend you for your devotion to Him. <br /><br /> You are a magnificent sight. As I've pondered and prayed about what I might share today, this question came to my mind: What insights can you uniquely contribute because of your experiences? By disposition and training, I am a scientist. From my earliest recollection, I've had deep interest in how the world works. For Christmas I'd ask for science toys. I had a chemistry set and a microscope and learned a lot about those subjects--without, thankfully, blowing up the house. I merely stained the old kitchen table. However, at age 12, three events would forever change my world. I was ordained a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood and committed that I would fulfill my priesthood responsibility. I found a home within the Church of Jesus Christ. I went to Scout camp for the first time and earned the astronomy merit badge. I fell in love with the night sky. Later that same summer, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin landed on the moon. These last two events kindled a love for astronomy that has never died. As a result, I trained to become an astronomer, beginning my college career here and serving a mission. I returned to Ricks, then on to BYU, where I finished my undergraduate degree. After serving in the U.S. Navy for five years, I attended graduate school at the University of Arizona, ultimately graduating with a doctorate degree in planetary science. While at Arizona, I became involved in nearly all facets of the scientific process--I performed original cutting-edge research on aspects of the earth's and moon's origin, wrote research grant proposals and original research papers, spoke at professional meetings, and even peer-reviewed the papers of others. After graduating, I began teaching at this institution and am now teaching my 24th year. Earlier this semester I was released from serving as the bishop of the Rexburg YSA 19th Ward, so I've had the opportunity to work with you and your peers closely, both professionally and ecclesiastically, and understand something of your worries and concerns. As a result, I've felt impressed to share with you insights that have come to me over the years about our eternal identity and destiny. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you ever get feeling down? Do you ever have self-doubt? Do you ever wonder if life is worthwhile or if you can measure up? If you have never felt this way, you are either very blessed or not being completely honest. It's normal to have these feelings. So what do you do about them? When I feel this way, I either go outside and sit under the starry canopy of the heavens or look at a picture of a galaxy. This may seem like a very unusual thing to do. Your astronomy professor will tell you that when you look at a galaxy like the one you see here,</p>
<p><img alt="Whirlpool Galxy" height="325" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202016/Graphics/Whirlpool_Galxy_250x325.jpg" width="250" /></p>
<p>you're looking at an enormous star system containing hundreds of billions of stars and planets. Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, is over 100,000 light-years across and contains an estimated 200-400 billion stars. Our galaxy is separated from its nearest large galactic neighbor, the great Andromeda Galaxy, <br /><br /> <img alt="Milky Way" height="191" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202016/Graphics/Milky%20Way.jpg" width="264" /> <br /><br />by 2&frac12; million light-years! This means that the light we receive from the Andromeda Galaxy tonight left there about 2&frac12; million years ago! However, even this enormous distance pales in comparison to the entire universe. Pictures taken with the Hubble Space Telescope <br /><br /> <img alt="Ultra Deep Field" height="320" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202016/Graphics/Ultra_Deep_Field_250x320.jpg" width="250" /> <br /><br />show galaxies that are over 13 billion light-years away. By counting the number of galaxies in this picture and knowing how large this patch of sky actually is, astronomers estimate that the universe must contain at least 125 billion galaxies! I read, a short time ago, that astronomers have greatly increased the number of galaxies in our universe to over <em>2 trillion</em>! &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you react to this incomprehensibly huge universe? Many feel very, very small and insignificant compared to the vastness of our universe. How about you? I share with you six points which, if understood, will help you both put your existence on this singular world into perspective and weather the trials and tribulations that will inevitably come in this life. They are, (1) God reveals our eternal identity and gives us strength to do His work, (2) Satan distorts our eternal identity, (3) God will help us overcome Satan's temptations, (4) God revealed our eternal destiny, (5) this Earth life has meaning and purpose, and (6) God sent His Son, our Savior, to give us the power we need to fulfill our eternal destiny. Let's briefly explore each of these essential points.</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;God reveals our eternal identity and gives us strength to do His work.</strong> Let's begin by turning to Moses 1. You can think of Moses 1 as the preface to the Creation story. Recall that God called Moses out of the burning bush to free the children of Israel from captivity in Egypt. Talk about an overwhelming calling! You may recall that Moses tried to squirm out of this calling--I am slow of speech, I am hated of my brethren, I am wanted for murder by the Egyptians (he had killed an Egyptian overlord), I don't even know God's name, the Israelites won't believe me, etc. God showed many miracles to convince Moses of His power. Moses finally agreed to go, but apparently he still harbored feelings of inadequacy when he received the revelation we know now as Moses 1. Moses received this revelation when he was "caught up into an exceedingly high mountain" (Moses 1:1), apparently after his call at the burning bush but sometime before he arrived in Egypt, because the revelation says, "For thou shalt&nbsp;deliver&nbsp;my people from&nbsp;bondage, even&nbsp;Israel my&nbsp;chosen" (Moses 1: 26). It seems clear to me that God gave Moses the revelation to reassure him that God could perform His work through Moses. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Moses 1 records two of the greatest revelations ever received by a mortal. Moses stands in God's presence and speaks with him "face to face" (Moses 1:31). God opens the first revelation with the following preface:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, I am the Lord God&nbsp;Almighty, and&nbsp;Endless&nbsp;is my&nbsp;name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless? <br /><br />And, behold, thou art my son; wherefore&nbsp;look, and I will show thee the&nbsp;workmanship&nbsp;of mine&nbsp;hands; but not all, for my&nbsp;works&nbsp;are without&nbsp;end, and also my&nbsp;words, for they never cease. <br /><br />Wherefore, no man can behold all my&nbsp;works, except he behold all my&nbsp;glory; and no man can&nbsp;behold&nbsp;all my&nbsp;glory, and afterwards remain in the flesh on the earth. <br /><br />And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the&nbsp;similitude&nbsp;of mine&nbsp;Only&nbsp;Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the&nbsp;Savior, for he is full of&nbsp;grace and&nbsp;truth; but there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;God beside me, and all things are present with me, for I&nbsp;know&nbsp;them all. <br /><br />And now, behold, this one thing I show unto thee, Moses, my son, for thou art in the world, and now I show it unto thee. <br /><br />And it came to pass that Moses looked, and beheld the world&nbsp;upon which he was created; and Moses&nbsp;beheld&nbsp;the world and the ends thereof, and all the children of men which are, and which were created; of the same he greatly marveled&nbsp;and wondered. (Moses 1:3-8) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who would not have marveled and wondered? Who would not have had more questions? Did you notice that God called Moses "my son" three times? This is your eternal identity. You are a child of God, His son or daughter. He loves you. What does knowing that you are His son or His daughter mean to you? It means that you can be assured that God loves you and will help you do all things that He has asked you to do. Just as God showed Moses the glorious vision of the earth to instill the confidence Moses needed to complete His work, He will let you know through the Holy Ghost that you are His child. That knowledge will allow you to face whatever trials may come your way, to do whatever work He would have you do. There were many times in my undergraduate years and graduate school that I began to doubt if I had the ability to complete such a difficult degree. Yet I knew that I was on the path God had for me to walk, and knowing that, coupled with knowing that I am His son, gave me the courage and faith to move forward with confidence.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Satan distorts our eternal identity.</strong> Let's return to Moses 1. After Moses's first vision, Moses 1 records that God's presence withdrew from Moses. He was completely drained. He fell to the earth and had no strength for several hours. Eventually he regained his natural strength.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He said unto himself: Now, for this cause I know that&nbsp;man&nbsp;is&nbsp;nothing, which thing I never had supposed. <br /><br />But now mine own eyes have&nbsp;beheld&nbsp;God; but not my natural, but my&nbsp;spiritual&nbsp;eyes, for my&nbsp;natural&nbsp;eyes could not have&nbsp;beheld; for I should have&nbsp;withered&nbsp;and&nbsp;died&nbsp;in his presence; but his&nbsp;glory&nbsp;was upon me; and I beheld his face, for I was&nbsp;transfigured&nbsp;before him. (Moses 1:10-11)</p>
<p>After this glorious vision, who should appear on the scene but Satan, tempting Moses: "Moses, son of man, worship me" (Moses 1:12). Notice the difference between how God addressed Moses and how Satan addressed him. Satan cast doubt in Moses's mind about who he really was. He distorted Moses's eternal identity. Certainly Moses and all of us are sons and daughters of man. In this life we have mortal bodies begotten by earthly parents. Satan's attempt, however, was to dismiss our eternal identity and convince us that we are only human, complex biochemical machines that just happen to be complex enough to have this wonderful property called consciousness. If Moses were just a "son of man," then how could Moses do God's work? If you are just a son or daughter of man, what eternal meaning does this life really have? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Distorting our eternal identity is one of Satan's most powerful tactics. He uses it on everyone he can. For example, you'll recall when Satan tempted the Savior at the beginning of his ministry, he hissed, "If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread" (Matthew 4:3). Satan distorted Christ's eternal identity and tried to cast doubt in Christ's mind about who He really was. Christ, of course, did not fall for the tactic. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In our day Satan continues to use this tactic with great success. Popular culture perpetuates Satan's lies; modern science completely ignores our eternal core. However, God declared (three times) that Moses was God's son. If you heed the whisperings of the Holy Ghost, you will feel the truth of the song "I Am a Child of God" (<em>Hymns</em>, no. 301). Please don't allow Satan to distort your eternal identity.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;God will help us overcome Satan's temptations.</strong> What happens after Satan comes to Moses on the mount, I think, is highly instructive. After Satan commands Moses to worship him, Moses looks on Satan and realizes that he can do so with his natural eyes. Moses answers (paraphrasing slightly), "Look, dude, I am a son of God; why should I worship you? I can look at you with my natural eyes, but I have seen God. I could not have seen Him with my natural eyes. God is a God of glory, so why would I worship you?" It is a response that comes out of pure knowledge--Moses has seen God and has seen the contrast between God and Satan. In fact, the tone of Moses's response is almost cocky. Moses commands Satan to depart. &nbsp; <br /><br />But does he? No! He rants, he raves, he throws a tizzy fit: "I am the Only Begotten, worship me" (Moses 1:19). The scripture now records, "And it came to pass that Moses began to&nbsp;fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of&nbsp;hell. Nevertheless,&nbsp;calling&nbsp;upon God, he received strength, and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of&nbsp;glory" (Moses 1:20). After throwing a final temper tantrum, Satan departs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me, this interchange teaches us that pure knowledge alone does not give us the power to resist Satan. Moses knew with perfect knowledge that he was a son of God. However, it was not until Moses called upon God that he received the strength he needed to overcome Satan's counterfeits. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>How about you? Do you have doubts that you are God's son or daughter? If so, why? What counterfeits has Satan and his minions offered you? Do you specifically ask God for strength to overcome Satan's distortions? If not, please consider adding that request in your prayers. When those times come that you have doubts about who you really are, remember this interchange between Moses and Satan. Follow Moses's example: pray specifically to God for the power to withstand Satan.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>God revealed our eternal destiny.</strong> After his confrontation with Satan, Moses's second vision unfolds. He is brought back into God's presence, face to face, according to Moses 1:31. Again he is shown a grand vision, such a vision that, as a scientist, I can only dream of.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass, as the voice was still speaking, Moses cast his eyes and&nbsp;beheld&nbsp;the earth, yea, even all of it; and there was not a particle of it which he did not behold, discerning&nbsp;it by the&nbsp;Spirit&nbsp;of God. <br /><br />And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a&nbsp;soul&nbsp;which he beheld not; and he discerned them by the Spirit of God; and their numbers were great, even numberless as the sand upon the sea shore. (Moses 1:27-28) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Moses definitely has questions! "Tell&nbsp;me, I pray thee, why these things are so, and by what thou madest them?" (Moses 1:30). We might ask the same question when we look at the objects in our universe through the eyes of the Hubble Space Telescope--stars, planets, clouds of gas and dust, and all those galaxies--galaxies almost innumerable. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>God answers Moses,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For mine own&nbsp;purpose&nbsp;have I made these things. Here is wisdom&nbsp;and it remaineth in me. <br /><br />And by the&nbsp;word&nbsp;of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of&nbsp;grace&nbsp;and truth. <br /><br />And&nbsp;worlds&nbsp;without number have I&nbsp;created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the&nbsp;Son&nbsp;I created&nbsp;them, which is mine&nbsp;Only Begotten. <br /><br />And the&nbsp;first&nbsp;man of all men have I called&nbsp;Adam, which is&nbsp;many. <br /><br />But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I&nbsp;know&nbsp;them. (Moses 1:31-35)</p>
<p>Moses relents and asks a more limited question:&nbsp;"Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and&nbsp;tell&nbsp;me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens, and then thy servant will be content" (Moses 1:36).</p>
<p>God's answer to Moses's humble inquiry provides us with one of the most profound statements in holy writ:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine. <br /><br />And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no&nbsp;end&nbsp;to my works, neither to my words. <br /><br />For behold, this is my&nbsp;work&nbsp;and my&nbsp;glory--to bring to pass the&nbsp;immortality&nbsp;and&nbsp;eternal&nbsp;life&nbsp;of man. (Moses 1:37-39) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In one simple, profound statement, God tells us the ultimate purpose for the entirety of the Creation. The earth, the solar system, the galaxy, the entire universe have but one purpose--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. This is God's mission statement, to help you and me become like He is--to have a glorified eternal body and to grow into the type of being He is. He does it because we are His spirit children, just as, hopefully, your parents have helped you become the person you have become so far. This is your eternal destiny!</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">This earth life has meaning and purpose.</strong> God showed Moses the earth and all the inhabitants of it. The prophet Abraham also had deep understanding of our eternal identity and destiny. He sums up the meaning and purpose of this earth in the following succinct statement. This is the theme scripture for the Issues of Science course I teach, How to Build a Habitable Planet.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And there stood&nbsp;one&nbsp;among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and&nbsp;we&nbsp;will make an earth whereon these may dwell; <br /><br />And we will&nbsp;prove&nbsp;them herewith, to see if they will&nbsp;do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; <br /><br />And they who&nbsp;keep&nbsp;their first&nbsp;estate&nbsp;shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second&nbsp;estate&nbsp;shall have&nbsp;glory&nbsp;added upon their heads for ever and ever. (Abraham 3:24-26)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here we have the purpose of this life explained in three short statements. The Savior created this world out of preexisting materials to provide us with a probationary state, to see if we would exercise our agency by following the commandments of God. We needed to leave God's presence--we needed to go to boarding school, so to speak--to grow, progress, and demonstrate that we would be obedient without being in God's presence. Those of us who do so, what is meant by "they who keep their second estate," will be glorified throughout the eternities. Of course, other scriptures, especially Doctrine and Covenants 76, amplify what God means by this statement to Abraham. This life is critically important. Satan tempts us to forget our eternal identity and destiny in a lot of ways, but one thing he does effectively is distorting the purpose of this life. He teaches many effective lies, like "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die" (2 Nephi 28:7), he who has the most toys wins, maximize pleasure, minimize pain, etc. However, if we clearly understand, and believe in, our eternal identity and destiny, it is easier to ignore Satan's lies.</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;God sent His Son, our Savior, to give us the power we need to fulfill our eternal destiny.</strong> God knew that we could not fulfill our eternal destiny alone. We would need to change and grow. We would make mistakes. We would not have the power on our own to fulfill our eternal destiny. Continuing from Abraham 3,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;said: Whom shall I&nbsp;send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And&nbsp;another&nbsp;answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will&nbsp;send&nbsp;the first. <br /><br />And the&nbsp;second&nbsp;was angry, and kept not his first&nbsp;estate; and, at that day, many followed after him. (Abraham 3:27-28)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christ's Atonement provides the power to both cleanse us from our sins and shortcomings and enable us to do all things the Lord commands us. When I partake of the sacrament each Sunday, I am reminded that God sent His Only Begotten Son to suffer, bleed, and die to prepare the way for us to be able to repent. His atoning sacrifice is the key ingredient to allow us to fulfill our eternal destiny.</p>
<p>This is the Christmas season, the time of year we remember, with the rest of the Christian world, the birth of our Savior. As you celebrate this year, I hope that you will look at a picture of a galaxy, or bundle up and go outside on a clear December night and look up at the starry canopy above and allow the Spirit to whisper to you that you are a beloved son or daughter of Heavenly Parents who love you enough to create a world and a universe so you can grow to become like Them. They love you enough to have sent Their Firstborn to this world to atone for your sins.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When I gaze at the starry heavens, the Spirit whispers to me, sometimes subtly, sometimes rather loudly, that I am, like Moses, a son of God, made in His image: my eternal identity. Likewise, when I look at a picture of a galaxy, knowing as I do that I am looking at the combined light of billions upon billions of stars, I know that He created it for you and for me. When I'm tempted or depression starts to set in, I'm reminded that Satan distorts our eternal identity and destiny. In these times, I seek the Lord and am reminded that He has power over Satan and will strengthen me when I seek Him. When I study this earth, marvel at its beauty, and remember what I've come to understand about its creation from the science that I have studied for years, I am reminded of what He revealed to Abraham about its purpose. <br /><br />I know that He lives. Please never, ever forget that He loves you. I testify that He does. I know it because during my service as bishop, I felt His love for you in a deep and poignant way. I know that your eternal identity is a son or daughter of God. Likewise, I know that your eternal destiny is to return to His presence, cleansed through the blood of Jesus Christ, to become like He is. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Good evening, Brothers and Sisters. I am grateful to be here with the administration, faculty, families, friends, and, most importantly, the members of the BYU-Idaho Class of 2016. It is an honor to participate with you in these commencement exercises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /> I have great respect for President Clark Gilbert and his wife Christine, as well as Elder Kim Clark and his wife Sue. Elder Clark and I became friends many years ago when we were undergraduates together. The Gilberts and Clarks have been marvelous leaders of this university. We admire the work being done at BYU-Idaho to educate young men and women--and we are proud of each one of you. Congratulations on your noteworthy accomplishment. <br /><br />As you leave the comforts of BYU-Idaho to face "<em>the world</em>," it is natural to wonder what lies ahead.&nbsp; The most <em>certain</em> thing we know is that we live in <em>uncertain</em> times--times the scriptures say when "all things shall be in commotion."<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The recent presidential election in this country brought a record amount of commotion and is still on our minds. Who ever thought we would face such a political season? <br /><br />A few weeks before the election, my wife and I were assigned to participate in the Philadelphia Pennsylvania Temple dedication. On Friday evening, we were having dinner with President Henry B. Eyring who was assigned to dedicate the temple. The course of our conversation turned to the upcoming election. The campaign seemed to reach a new low in its ugliness. Many people, on both sides of the political spectrum, expressed their distress at what was occurring and their fears about what would take place if the other side prevailed. We asked President Eyring what he thought about it. <br /><br />He responded that he was not particularly concerned. God was still in charge, America still had a divine destiny, and the Lord would prevail over all obstacles. I don't think I talked to anyone during the election process who was calmer about the future than President Eyring. It caused me to step back and think about how caught up everyone, including me, had become in the events of the day. President Eyring knew the truth of this scripture:&nbsp;<br />"My name is Jehovah, and I know the end from the beginning; therefore my hand shall be over thee." <a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> <br /><br />As you face your own future, you need to know how to build a life that is strong enough to withstand the uncertainties that lie ahead. Given all that we cannot foresee or control, what reliable foundation <em>can</em> you build your life upon? <br /><br />Helaman's advice is as good today as it was long ago:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And now, my sons [and my daughters] remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless woe, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall."<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can promise you that the mighty storms and the shafts in the whirlwind will come into your life and beat on you. How will you withstand them? <br /><br />In the Pearl of Great Price, Jesus says, "I am Messiah, the King of Zion, the Rock of Heaven . . . whoso . . . climbeth up by me shall never fall."<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Did you notice the similar promises? "A foundation whereon if men build <em>they cannot fall</em>," and "Whoso climbeth up by me <em>shall never fall</em>." How can you take advantage of such a promise? I would like to share some thoughts with you about ways to build a life on the rock of Jesus Christ. <br /><br />The first way is make Christ your exemplar, your ideal--the standard by which you measure your own life. People look to various sources for role models today. In some cases, they choose sports figures, or celebrities, or accomplished leaders. However, they all have their flaws and drawbacks. The only one who does not is Jesus Christ. Said He to His disciples in the new world: "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am."<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> He is the ultimate role model. <br /><br />It would be easy to dismiss this as impractical. How can we really be like Him? After all, His world was so different than ours. And in an important way we can't be like Him since He was perfect and we are not.&nbsp; We are all too aware of our shortcomings when compared to His perfect life. Yet there must be a right way to live out this injunction to be like Him or Christ wouldn't have said it. In what way did He mean for us, fallen men and women, to be as He was? <br /><br />Certainly the first step is to keep before us continually the virtues and qualities of character that Christ demonstrated in his life; to read and reread the stories in the gospels and 3<sup>rd</sup> Nephi until we are quite familiar with the mortal Jesus, whose name in prophetic foretelling was <em>Immanuel</em>, or "God with us." Though He was the mighty God Jehovah of the Old Testament, He nonetheless entered fully into an ordinary, normal human life, having human relatives, friends and neighbors, walking and talking with them, sharing meals with them, attending their weddings, and sharing the common lot of man. As such, the scriptures tell us, he was "tempted in all points like as we are" so that he could be "touched with the feeling of our infirmities."<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Thus, we come face to face with the amazing <em>condescension of God</em>, his willingness to <em>come down</em> and become one of us. At the time, however, people did not recognize him as the promised Messiah because He came without all the expected trappings of power. He "came unto his own," said the apostle John, "and his own received him not."<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> The question for all of us is: Will we receive Him? Our hearts are moved by His mighty sacrifice and we feel to promise Him that <em>we</em> won't be like His uncomprehending countrymen, but that <em>we</em> will come to Him and truly seek to know Him. <br /><br />This process will take our conscious effort. It is the great pursuit of the Christian life, and temporary setbacks are to be expected when our goal is to emulate the Son of God. The constant refrain of repentance in the gospel message is a recognition that we will fail repeatedly and need to continue trying to do better. Each time we stumble, the Lord is calling to us to get back up and try again. <br /><br />Our son, Brigham, played water polo in high school and had an outstanding coach who had been a college All-American. Often, when our son had the ball on offense, Coach Purcell could see he had a potential scoring opportunity and would yell, "Shoot it!" If Brigham missed, the coach would laugh and say "Shoot it better next time." I think the Lord has a similar approach as he watches and encourages us along life's path. &nbsp; <br /><br />We lean on Christ's example, trying to reach for something better--striving to be better. When we seek to be the way Jesus was, it has the practical impact of both humbling us and of subtly working on us until we slowly begin to actually change and take on the qualities that were once beyond us. We need to practice being like Christ. Over and over again. The apostle Paul taught that we should use the "measure of the stature of the fullness of&nbsp;Christ" as the yardstick to gauge our own character development.<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> <br /><br />Jesus spoke often of the need for humility and said of himself, "I am meek and lowly in heart."<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> One of his most profound sermons on this subject is found in the book of Luke, the 22<sup>nd</sup> chapter. It begins when Christ notices the all too human predisposition of his disciples to jockey for position and recognition. The scripture says "there was a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest." (Luke 22:24) <br /><br />Before we are too hard on the young apostles, let us make plain the obvious. No one can begin to be humble until he recognizes just how much of common, ordinary, self-centeredness and pride he has. These men recorded their own foibles in the pages of scripture so that we might learn from them. Christ, hearing his disciples squabble, began to teach them the profound principle that greatness in the Kingdom of God derives from service and humility. Here is what he says in Luke 22, verses 25 through 27, in a modern amplified translation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Jesus said to them, "The Gentile kings lord it over their people, and powerful rulers love to be known as benefactors to get attention and make themselves feel good. <br /><br />But it is not to be this way with you; on the contrary, the one who is the greatest among you must become like the least important and the leader must become like the servant. <br /><br />For who is more important: the one sitting at the table or the one waiting on him? Isn't it the one sitting at the table? But I am among you as one who serves."<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> </p>
<p>In my professional life as a health care executive, I attended many impressive banquets in hotel ballrooms. If you were to look around on these occasions, it would be easy to pick out the most important people in the room. They would be seated on a dais or at a head table. One's position in the organization could be quickly ascertained by where you were assigned to sit. The most important people sit at the front of the room, the newcomers and less noteworthy people at the back. And of course, in the view of the world, the least important of all would be the waiters. Dressed in black in order to blend in and become almost invisible, they would move about the room, serving dinner, pouring water and clearing plates away. These were usually people at the lower end of the economic scale, often immigrants with limited skills. <br /><br />After years of attending these banquets, I thought back on those experiences in the context of this Luke scripture. In Luke's account, Jesus, the most exalted person who ever lived on this earth, identifies himself not with the people at the head table but with the waiters, silently moving about the room, serving others.&nbsp; He was among us as one who served. <br /><br />You will find in life that there are these two ways to live. The first is the world's way. It seeks attention, applause, recognition, glory. Its purpose is to exalt oneself. This is a natural thing to do. We like to win, to get awards, to be noticed, to be the assistant to the president. We see that even Christ's apostles began with their fair share of the natural man's native pride. <br /><br />But if we would build a life on the rock of Christ, we must do as He says and try to be like Him. That means the very opposite of what the world promotes. We must die to self and let Christ live through us as we serve others. We must live to glorify Him and not ourselves. This is not easy, but it is a deeply rewarding way to live, and the only way to live if we want to hear the Savior say to us, "Well done thou good and faithful servant." &nbsp;What are your desires--to be at the head table receiving the recognition of others or, like the Savior, to be among your fellow men as one who serves? <br /><br />I once read an account of a man who had what we call a 'near death experience' as a young 18-year-old recruit at the beginning of WWII. He had died in a flu epidemic that swept the barracks of his training camp. At one point his spirit met--one might say had an interview with--a personage of light he identified as Jesus Christ. This Being asked him, "What have you done with your life?" There ensued a review in which his whole life passed before his mind's eye. This young man searched frantically among his memories for something he could show Jesus, and finally he said, "I was an Eagle Scout." The Being of light smiled, and said gently, "This you did to glorify yourself. What have you done to glorify me?"<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> <br /><br />What if you live your life assuming that someday you will hear a similar question: "What have you done to glorify Me?" If you learn to follow Christ's example of servanthood and humility, you will be building upon the Rock. Those of you who hold the Priesthood after the order of the Son of God must learn to be humble servant-leaders and never Priesthood dictators. <br /><br />Another way to build your life's foundation on the rock of Christ is to come to know His redeeming power. Let me illustrate with a story.&nbsp; The first section of the Doctrine and Covenants says, "Knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth," the Lord established his church through the prophet Joseph Smith, "that faith might increase in the earth and that his everlasting covenant might be established."<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> <br /><br />Surely one of the calamities that has come upon this earth was the terrible genocide in Rwanda in 1994. That tragedy resulted in somewhere between 500,000 to 1 million people--men, women and children--being slaughtered simply for belonging to the Tutsi tribe. Those of us who were alive at that time remember the horrible pictures of thousands of bodies floating down the rivers. <br /><br />Recently Elder Dale G. Renlund and his wife, Ruth, were in an airport in Africa traveling on Church business. They began speaking with a man who, it turned out, was from Rwanda. This man asked them what they were doing in Africa, and they explained they were there serving for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. At this information a shadow passed across his face. <br /><br />"There is no God," he said. "Why didn't God help us when the genocide took place? If there is a God, why didn't he do something?" <br /><br />Sister Renlund answered him: "He did. He did do something. He sent His son Jesus Christ to earth to suffer and die for our sins, so that this atoning sacrifice would redeem us from all the terrible things like you have been through. Then He sent the prophet Joseph Smith to restore his true gospel to earth, and to restore the sealing power that allows us to bless our families." What a great answer she gave! <br /><br />The Lord Jesus Christ <em>is</em> the answer for both the calamities of nations and the calamities of our individual lives. Because of Him, "even our deepest trials and most profound struggles have meaning and purpose."<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> Because He took upon himself all our sin, pain and suffering--He can redeem anything that comes into our lives and turn it to our eternal good. <br /><br />I had occasion to learn this lesson in a deep and personal way. About 10 years ago, a serious autoimmune disease struck me out of the blue, causing intense pain in every joint of my body. I began losing weight and became so physically debilitated that I was home-bound for 18 months. My body went spiraling downward until I had to stop working and be released from my Church calling as an Area Seventy. I lost so much weight and strength that I could only walk a short distance. The doctors could not say what caused the disease nor could they tell me what the future held. As one of them said to me, "You will either die or get better. We can't know which until one or the other of those two outcomes happens." <br /><br />Things looked bleak and I was discouraged. Much of my self-worth had been based on the things I was able to accomplish. I was a doer, I suppose. At the lowest point in my mental journey, my wife and I decided to start a gratitude journal, focusing on the daily things by which we could see the hand of the Lord working in our behalf. We knew that Christ's atonement was real and the Savior was the fountain of all blessings. It became our quest to look for and appreciate those blessings each day, no matter how small. <br /><br />If someone was kind and came to visit, we wrote that in our gratitude journal. If we learned of someone's prayers in our behalf, we wrote that down. If we learned of a friend's successful battle against a similar health challenge, we took courage and wrote that down. Early on I wrote in my gratitude journal that I was grateful for the faith of my wife, who believed so completely and relentlessly in my ultimate recovery. If I received a priesthood blessing, I wrote that in my gratitude journal--all of these things as evidences of the Lord's love and tender care despite the facts of my illness. <br /><br />Every day I weighed myself and watched my body wasting away. Then, after 18 months, my weight stopped dropping and I went for several months without it changing. I thanked the Lord for that. One day, I weighed myself and saw that I had gained a pound-- one pound-- and I wrote it in my gratitude journal. Very, very slowly the pain began to diminish and my weight and strength began to return. It took many months. I became strong enough to walk around the block. I wrote down how grateful I was to be able to walk around the block. Eventually, I was healthy enough to return to work and to service in the kingdom. <br /><br />I do not know why I became sick and I do not know why I got better. But I do know, like David of old, that the Lord was my shield and my high tower, my rock and my refuge in the day of my trouble.<a href="/speeches/elder-larry-y-wilson#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> The blessings of the atonement are real. For each of us this means that any calamity, any tragedy whether personal or national, can be redeemed through the power of Christ to lift and to heal if we are built upon that rock. <br /><br />Build your life, consciously and purposefully, on the foundation stone of Jesus Christ, the Rock of Heaven. Be as one who serves. If you stay rooted in Him, you be able to withstand the mighty storms and the shafts in the whirlwind that will beat upon you. <br /><br />Never get discouraged because it is hard. Failure is one more avenue for growth and learning. Pick yourself up and try again tomorrow. And so, my brothers and sisters, take with you the great wisdom of Helaman on life's journey: "Remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, that ye must build your foundation...a foundation whereon if men [and women] build they cannot fall." <br /><br />I bear you my witness of the Savior's ability to do that for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>I am grateful to be with you tonight. This is a happy day for you and for your families, friends, and loved ones, and it is a privilege to be here with you. <br /><br />I want to share a thought with you about learning for a lifetime and some advice about keeping your heart and your mind open to learning all through your lives. I hope it will be helpful to you. &nbsp; <br /><br />When I use the word learning tonight, I have in mind learning of the whole soul--the mind, the heart, and your immortal spirit. This is learning that increases our power to know and understand, to take effective action, and to grow and become more like our Father in Heaven. Learning of the whole soul is inherently a spiritual experience and rests, therefore, on a foundation of faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to His commandments. The Lord has made it abundantly clear that such learning is essential to our eternal salvation, and to building up the kingdom of God and establishing Zion.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things--that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal.<a href="/speeches/elder-kim-b-clark#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />...it is my will that you should ... obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man, and all this for the salvation of Zion.<a href="/speeches/elder-kim-b-clark#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>It is crucial that we continue to learn all through our lives. It is not just a good thing to do; it is essential. If we do not learn, we do not grow and change.&nbsp; If we do not grow and change, we do not become more knowledgeable, more effective, more useful, more faithful, and more like our Father in Heaven. In fact, if we do not exercise our God-given power to learn and grow and change, we will lose power until we know and can do less and less. &nbsp; <br /><br />Let me give you an example. Imagine graduating from college 40 years ago, in the mid-1970s, like Elder Wilson and I did. What if we had stopped learning? What if we learned literally nothing else our whole lives except the things we had learned to that point? We would have had no new insights or revelation from the living prophets, the scriptures, or the Holy Ghost. We would know nothing of developments in medicine, technology, globalization, world affairs, environmental change, government regulation, and education. There would have been no personal growth nor development through repentance and learning from our experience. &nbsp; <br /><br />When Sister Clark and I served here at BYU-Idaho she was often asked, "How did you meet President Clark?" The first thing she said in response was, "He wasn't President Clark when I met him." If there had been no learning, I would have gotten older, but I would still be the 25-year-old Sister Clark knew when I graduated from college--not a good prospect for Sister Clark and our family. &nbsp; <br /><br />Because you are graduates of BYU-Idaho, you have a great advantage in the quest to learn all through your lives. You have been immersed in the principles of the BYU-Idaho Learning Model. At BYU-Idaho students and teachers know from experience that learning comes: 1) in revelation and inspiration through the Light of Christ and the ministry of the Holy Ghost; 2) through systematic inquiry as teachers and students take responsibility for their own learning and engage with one another in learning experiences of many kinds; and 3) by acting with faith in Christ to teach one another, attended by His grace.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />As you seek to learn you will discover that these principles work powerfully in any situation--at home, at work, in your community, or at church. If you keep your covenants and if your hearts and your minds are open to learning, diligent application of these principles will help you learn with your whole soul, no matter what you are trying to learn. This promise of the Lord Jesus Christ is for you, and it is true:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Draw&nbsp;near&nbsp;unto me and I will draw near unto you;&nbsp;seek me diligently and ye shall&nbsp;find&nbsp;me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.<a href="/speeches/elder-kim-b-clark#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>As you move forward to learn all through your lives, I hope you will remember these simple things that will help you keep your mind and your heart open to learning of the whole soul:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Ask the Lord to bless you with the desire to learn. <br /></strong> If you already have that desire, wonderful. If not, ask the Lord for that gift. The Lord will educate your desires so that you will seek, ask, and knock. You will want to learn what He wants you to learn all through your lives. That desire will work in you, and your heart and mind will be open to learning. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Make repentance a central part of your life. <br /></strong> Repentance is a divine process. It is the way we change, grow, and get better. If we repent, we can become more like our Heavenly Father through the redeeming and strengthening power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. If repentance is central to your life, you will always be on your knees, humbling yourself before the Lord, seeking His help. Your heart and your mind will be open to learning of the whole soul.&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Worship in the temple as often as you can. <br /></strong> The temple is the Lord's house. It is His house of revelation and learning. If you go there often, if you take your questions and your desires to learn with you, the Lord Himself will teach you. As you participate in sacred ordinances on behalf of departed ancestors, as you ponder the deep things of God, your heart and your mind will be open to learning.</p>
<p>I know that if you will do these three simple things the Lord Jesus Christ will bless you with His light, His love, and His grace. And you will learn with your whole soul all through your lives. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Clark G. Gilbert became the 16th&nbsp;president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in April 2015.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Gilbert brings a range of academic and professional experiences to his assignment in Rexburg. Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho in 2015, President Gilbert served as CEO of Deseret News Publishing Company and Deseret Digital Media. He also served as an associate academic vice president at BYU-Idaho, overseeing the implementation of online learning and the Pathway program. As a deeply committed teacher, President Gilbert had administrative responsibility for the Learning Model at BYU-Idaho. Prior to coming to Rexburg, he was a professor of entrepreneurial management at the Harvard Business School where he taught and studied in the field of organizational innovation.<br /><br />President Gilbert graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor's degree in International Relations. He earned a master's degree in East Asian Studies from Stanford University and a doctorate degree in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Gilbert has served in multiple ecclesiastical roles, including counselor in a stake presidency, bishop, counselor in a bishopric, Young Men's president, Gospel Doctrine teacher, and Scoutmaster. He currently teaches the CTR 7 Primary class with his wife, Christine.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />President Gilbert was born in California and raised in Arizona. He and his wife, Christine, are the parents of eight children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, I want you to know how much Sister Gilbert and I love you.&nbsp; You are remarkable and represent the hopes and prayers of so many of us for the future of this great Church.&nbsp; Please know of the confidence we have in you and the roles you will play in building the kingdom.&nbsp; <br /><br />Second, I want you to look around and remember the strength you feel in this auditorium tonight.&nbsp; Isn't this incredible?&nbsp; In fact, the gathering in this auditorium is a symbol of the strength of the Church in your lives.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />In a time not far from now, many of you will find yourselves in settings where you won't be gathered with such strength and you will have to stand for what is right on your own.&nbsp; In those moments I want you to look back and remember the feelings you had as you were gathered in the strength of the Church.&nbsp; I want you to look back and draw on the strength you feel tonight as we gather together one last time in this sacred space. &nbsp; <br /><br />This evening is particularly special for Sister Gilbert and me.&nbsp; Many of the parents in the audience attend tonight in support of a son or daughter who is graduating; and while he is not our own son, this evening is meaningful to us as we watch one of our Boston youth graduate and join his wife, Nancy, as they head off as BYU-Idaho graduates to build a life and to build the kingdom in Northern California.&nbsp; Danny represents the end of a generation of youth we knew and loved from Boston who found their way to this great university.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Danny is the only son of Dominican immigrants.&nbsp; His parents did not have the opportunity for an education.&nbsp; Last night I visited with Danny and his family, and we marveled at what has happened since Danny left Boston.&nbsp; He has served a mission, been married in the temple, and tonight he becomes a graduate of BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; And, yet, if we fully understand the mission of this university, our work--Danny's work--has only just begun. &nbsp; <br />In Doctrine and Covenants, section 64, verse 33, we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.</p>
<p>Each of you graduates tonight has laid the "foundation [for] a great work."&nbsp; And that work has only just begun.&nbsp; It is my prayer and our hope that as you leave here tonight you will continue to grow in Christ and continue to prepare to serve in your homes, the Church, and your communities, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>
