<p>As I watched you arrive this evening, I had the impression that you represent some of the very finest of the rising generation. I am confident you will do much to prepare the world for the Savior&rsquo;s return. I commend you. I am honored to be with you and profoundly grateful to your University leaders for inviting me to share this evening with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you are new to Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho. Sincere congratulations on your acceptance! Now, be careful and do not suppose because you made it here, that you have &ldquo;made it,&rdquo; period. Not so! BYU-Idaho is a &ldquo;Disciple Preparation Center.&rdquo; Your life thus far has prepared you for that preparation. Now, the journey begins in earnest! I invite you to listen carefully to the following two verses from a poem entitled; &ldquo;Think Not When You Gather to Zion,&rdquo; written by Eliza R. Snow <sup>[<a name="endref1" target="_self"></a>1]</sup> and modified for this occasion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think not when you gather to <em>BYU-Idaho</em>, all your troubles and trials are through,</p>
<p>That nothing but comfort and pleasure, are waiting on <em>campus</em> for you.</p>
<p>No, no, &lsquo;tis designed as a furnace, all substance and textures to try,</p>
<p>To burn all the wood, hay, and stubble; the gold from the dross purify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think not when you gather to <em>BYU-Idaho</em>, the prize and the victory won,</p>
<p>Think not that the warfare has ended, that the work of salvation is done.</p>
<p>No, no for the great Prince of Darkness, a ten-fold exertion will make,</p>
<p>When he sees you approaching the fountain where freely the truth you may take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To evaluate your scholastic progress, you will take tests. As students, you understand and even expect that. To measure your discipleship development, you will also be tested. During your years at this university, you will see some students getting good grades on discipleship tests. Others will struggle and barely pass. Sadly, a few will fail. Each of you is as capable of passing discipleship tests as any other. You must understand that. You must never forget that. &ldquo;Therefore, <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/10/23a" target="_self" title="TG Cheerfulness.">cheer</a> up your hearts, and remember that ye are <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/10/23b" target="_self" title="TG Agency.">free</a> to <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/10/23c" target="_self" title="2 Ne. 2: 16.">act</a> for yourselves&mdash;to <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/10/23d" target="_self" title="Deut. 30: 19 (15, 19)">choose</a> the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life.&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref2" target="_self"></a>2]</sup> Let me explain further&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A priesthood leader judged each of you worthy to attend this special university. Did you notice there were no worthiness questions about attractiveness, car make and model, or wardrobe? Worldly priorities like these may leverage one into great and spacious buildings but not into the Lord&rsquo;s university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, discipleship, the willingness to submit to God, is the qualifier. Discipleship starts every student out on equal ground with every other. &ldquo;Or in fine,&rdquo; Alma taught, &ldquo;in the first place they were on the same standing with their brethren.&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref3" target="_self"></a>3]</sup> It is given to each one of you to choose for yourself if yes, or no, or to what degree you will submit your will to God&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That, brothers and sisters, is what this special university is all about. Truth be known, you may receive a diploma simply by staying worthy and filling course requirements but, you will never be a true Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho <em>graduate</em> until your very heart beats to the rhythm, &ldquo;Thy will, not mine, Thy will, not mine&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; the soul cry of the true disciple of Christ!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This evening I will speak concerning &ldquo;student discipleship.&rdquo; What you receive specifically about what you need individually from this fireside will come from the Holy Ghost. What you hear that is not spoken will be the most important message you take home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you will, beginning this moment, reverently think about that Holy Being to whom you have declared your discipleship you will feel the Spirit&rsquo;s presence. Remembering Jesus always, always invites the Spirit. <sup>[<a name="endref4" target="_self"></a>4]</sup> It may help you to write down the phrase, &ldquo;To become a better disciple of Christ, I will&hellip;&rdquo; and then prayerfully invite the Holy Ghost to help you finish the sentence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Student discipleship implies student <em>of</em> discipleship and that refers to all of us. My message therefore, applies to all of us students engaged in the gospel curriculum of being perfected in Christ. We have much to learn. A lifetime and more of study and application are needed for us to become &ldquo;even as he is.&rdquo; But, trying to be like Jesus, and succeeding, will forever be, the true disciple&rsquo;s ultimate objective. Brothers and sisters, &ldquo;just men made perfect&rdquo; are simply disciples who allow their discipleship to do for them and to them what it was designed to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our subject this evening has many dimensions. I will discuss four. If you are perceptive, you will notice that they do not have rigid boundaries but weave and inter-weave, each one into the others. That is not coincidental. Student discipleship is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his Tree of Life vision, Lehi taught a fundamental lesson about the first dimension: continuous student discipleship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it came to pass that I beheld others [who did] press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost. <sup>[<a name="endref5" target="_self"></a>5]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those same scoffing high rise residents also pointed the finger of scorn at Nephi and others who were partaking of the fruit, but, they heeded them not. <sup>[<a name="endref6" target="_self"></a>6]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the disciples who eventually partook of the fruit, some fell, some stood. What made the difference? The answer is a &ldquo;tense&rdquo; thing &ndash; past-perfect tense versus past-progressive. Those who fell away were they who &ldquo;had tasted&rdquo; but stopped. Those who stayed firm, on the other hand, &ldquo;were partaking.&rdquo; They tasted&hellip;and kept eating&hellip;and lived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus taught us to pray, &ldquo;give us this day, our daily bread.&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref7" target="_self"></a>7]</sup> Physical and spiritual nourishment are better given in daily doses than in huge, single-dose applications - as suggested in the &ldquo;Parable of the Apple Tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man loved fresh apples and so determined to plant his own tree and enjoy a yearly harvest. He learned what he could about nurturing an apple tree for the first two years before it produces fruit. He chose the spot, carefully planted the tree, and proceeded to prune it and water it &ndash; <em>enough for two years</em>. He dumped fertilizer around it, sufficient for two years. He applied two year&rsquo;s worth of pesticide spray. And then, he left for two years. Upon returning, he saw, instead of a fruit bearing apple tree, a dried and lifeless one. He wept and said, &ldquo;What could I have done more for my apple tree? Did I not prune it and fertilize it and water it?&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref8" target="_self"></a>8]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To disciples in his day and ours, Alma asked the question of questions, &ldquo;And now behold, I say unto you; my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel to do so now?&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref9" target="_self"></a>9]</sup> Discipleship, like nurturing trees, is not a one time application, but a steady installment of tender care and attention.&nbsp; Not, &ldquo;been there, done that&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;still here, still doing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will soon learn, if you have not already, that continuous discipleship is both taught and expected at Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho. Brothers and sisters, endorsement is not a once-per-semester pronouncement of worthiness, but rather a <em>continuous</em> <em>endorse-ability</em> every day of every semester. And that applies to all &ndash; each student, every administrator, instructor, and employee. &ldquo;If ye have once declared worthiness to attend BYU&mdash;Idaho, I would ask, can ye feel to do so now?&rdquo; is a question you must ask yourself several times every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma the Younger commended his son, Shiblon, saying, &ldquo;And now&hellip;I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness&hellip;unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth&hellip;even so I hope that you will continue&hellip;&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref10" target="_self"></a>10]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With heart and signature, each of you has committed to steady faithfulness. That commitment is required of every entering and every returning student. Therefore, our beloved young associates, as you have commenced, even so may you continue. By definition, true discipleship must be continuous. God cannot look upon intermittence with the least degree of allowance. <sup>[<a name="endref11" target="_self"></a>11]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chronicling the majestic, expansive work of creation, Abraham wrote, &ldquo;And the Gods pronounced the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, pronounced they, &ldquo;great Waters; and the Gods saw that they were obeyed.&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref12" target="_self"></a>12]</sup> There followed grass and tree, herb and seed, lights in the expanse of heaven, sea creatures, fowls of the air, animals of the earth, and laws to sustain life, and the Gods saw that all these would obey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happily for us, the scripture does not read, &ldquo;&hellip;and the Gods saw that they were obeyed &ndash; occasionally, from time to time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ponder, for example, what would happen if gravity became unpredictable or if the sun were to shine sometimes, every once in a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How would your life change if the commandments were intermittent? &ldquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself &ndash; oh, and check the bulletin board in the Manwaring Center to see if that applies today.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Thou shalt not steal&hellip;every other week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what of constancy in relationships? How would you feel about a marriage partner who says, &ldquo;I love you today, but we&rsquo;ll see about tomorrow. Well did James teach, &ldquo;A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref13" target="_self"></a>13]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laws that govern all creation are <em>continuous</em>. Even the very notion that they could be &ldquo;on again, off again&rdquo; is unsettling. And yet, the devil would have you believe that obedience to God&rsquo;s laws and His prophets can be intermittent and still be acceptable. Brothers and sisters, I witness and the Spirit confirms that that simply is not so. Should the thought ever enter your mind that counsel from bishops or stake presidents can be occasionally observed &ndash; perish the thought! It is not of God. If someone were to suggest that university guidelines apply only to some and only some of the time, &ldquo;Get thee behind me!&rdquo; would be an appropriate reply. It would surely be your safest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BYU-Idaho Honor Code is an application of and an opportunity to demonstrate continuous student discipleship. This Honor Code is not a campus law, enforceable only when one is on school property or being watched. Rather, it is an opportunity for all of us, students, faculty, and administration alike, to demonstrate continuous allegiance to the Lord &ndash; on or off campus, in public or unobserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An enrolled BYU-Idaho student disciple for example, does not become &ldquo;un-enrolled,&rdquo; simply because he or she steps off campus. Nor is it enough to be kind and solicitous of others&rsquo; well-being when on campus only to turn grumpy and self-absorbed at a grocery store or gas station downtown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not enough to be modest in dress, clean shaven, and pure in thought while at the Lord&rsquo;s university and then adopt lower standards when off campus. Because you became a disciple of Christ by entering into covenants, you cannot be occasional with discipleship without also being occasional with covenants. And, referring to covenants, &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; is just another word for &ldquo;broken.&rdquo; Student discipleship implies serving God with all your heart, might, mind, and strength and doing so <em>always</em> at all times, and <em>always</em> in all places, and <em>always</em> in all company!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I testify that student discipleship attitudes and patterns formed while at Brigham Young University &ndash; Idaho will have more to do with who you marry, how you marry, how you raise your children, where you live, how you live, Church membership vitality, enduring to the end in faithfulness, in fact more to do with every aspect of your life, than you will ever suppose until looking back from the vantage point of years to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second dimension &ndash; Luke&rsquo;s narrative of Jesus&rsquo; Gethsemane experience reveals a heartening pattern concerning unconditional discipleship. Pressed upon by the terrible burden of the atonement, Jesus prayed, &ldquo;Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will but thine, be done.&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref14" target="_self"></a>14]</sup> The very next verse reads, &ldquo;And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.&rdquo; The Father&rsquo;s will&hellip;<em>then</em> the Father&rsquo;s help. The help came only after the heart yielded but significantly, it came <em>immediately</em> thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heavenly Father is eager to help you but only in ways that will be good for you. You could hardly expect Him to send angels to speed you along your way on the wrong road or to help you succeed in doing something that would bring unhappiness! The Gethsemane pattern that Jesus taught applies to you, &ldquo;The Father&rsquo;s will&hellip;<em>then</em> the Father&rsquo;s help.&rdquo; His help will come only after your heart is yielded but, significantly, it will come<em> immediately</em> &ndash; in the very next verse of your own life&rsquo;s narrative!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Challenging experiences come to all of us. &ldquo;We will prove them herewith&hellip;&rdquo; is well underway here at BYU-Idaho. As an instructor, I have watched and marveled as students like you have had mountain waves <sup>[<a name="endref15" target="_self"></a>15]</sup> break upon them. And like you, their unconditional discipleship has led them all the way from &ldquo;Master the tempest is raging!&rdquo; to, &ldquo;Peace, peace, be still.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let me tell you of one such couple. The husband is still enrolled. You will see both of them on campus. I will not disclose who they are. That way everyone will seem special, because it could be anyone you see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little over two years ago, this recently married couple discovered they were expecting their first baby. Early in the pregnancy ultrasounds revealed that part of the intestine was developing outside the body, a condition known as gastroschisis (gas-tro-ski&rsquo;-sis). Medical professionals outside the Rexburg area were concerned about the severity of the deformity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like you, however, this young husband and wife were student disciples and their allegiance to Christ was unconditional. &ldquo;Father, whatever you want is what we want.&rdquo; And so they prayed and they fasted, they prayed and they hoped. The baby was born in Primary Children&rsquo;s Hospital. Though serious, the deformity was miraculously much less extensive than diagnostic evaluations had indicated. Reparative surgery was done and the baby boy began to heal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, the couple&rsquo;s prayers were again answered. Another baby was on its way, this time, a little girl. By inspiration, a name was chosen and preparations for her arrival were lovingly made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a graveside service just six days ago, the young father bowed his head and through his tears, dedicated the grave of their precious daughter who was born lifeless on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So like this young couple are so many of you. Through tear and trial, you preserve with all of your heart, the uncondition-ality of your discipleship. And the Lord who still looketh on the heart <sup>[<a name="endref16" target="_self"></a>16]</sup> sees your sincerity and immediately sends angels from heaven to strengthen you. If He did not, you could not possibly, as has this young couple, bear your Gethsemane burdens with such spiritual dignity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sooner or later those who are serious about eternal life must, from the very depth of their being, yield everything to God. &ldquo;There it is Father, all of it, on the altar. My expectations, demands and perceived entitlements, my health, my wealth, my position, titles, and good name, my spouse, my children, my life &ndash; there it is. It is not Thine for the asking&hellip;it is Thine &ndash; period, without the asking. I give it all to Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then, even as you speak, you will wince a bit realizing that all these were already His, His to give and His to take. Maybe then &ndash; maybe not &ndash; but in due time if you are true to your intentions, the Spirit will lead you from &ldquo;mine, mine!,&rdquo; to&nbsp; &ldquo;Father, all my heart I give Thee, all my service shall be Thine!&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref17" target="_self"></a>17]</sup> and in so doing, you will have yielded your will to God&hellip;the highest expression of your student discipleship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, you will need heaven&rsquo;s help if you are to succeed here at school and afterwards. You cannot do it alone. I invite you to search your heart and pray that you can put off any resistance toward any commandment, guideline, or expectation the Lord has given to BYU-Idaho student disciples. Your unconditional giving to Him will nurture His unimpeded giving to you &ndash; His Spirit, His guidance, His power, His peace. I know that to be true. I witness that it is so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third &ndash; Compassionate student discipleship: Integral to student discipleship is a covenant to seek out and help those in need. Learn to live that principle well. Student discipleship will not let us turn our heads, drop our eyes, or cross to the other side of the street when people in need are nearby &ndash; no exceptions, no options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A document entitled, &ldquo;Leadership Training Emphasis&rdquo; was introduced to the Church in September 1995. In the intervening nearly 15 years it was the definitive statement on what every Church leader&rsquo;s focus should be. In December 2009, the document was revised with the following phrase added, &ldquo;&hellip;and assist the poor and needy in the Lord&rsquo;s way.&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref18" target="_self"></a>18]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the December 10, 2009 edition of the Salt Lake Tribune was an article entitled - "New LDS emphasis: Care for the needy." A few lines from the article...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compassion for the elderly and infirm that has come to characterize Thomas S. Monson's ministry soon will be embraced more fully by the worldwide church he leads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LDS Church is adding &lsquo;to care for the poor and needy&rsquo; to its longstanding &lsquo;threefold mission,&rsquo; [soon to be called &lsquo;purposes&rsquo;] which is to preach the LDS gospel, purify members' lives and provide saving ordinances such as baptism to those who have died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are not a disciple just so you can follow Jesus, but so you can lead others to Him as well. The Master&rsquo;s best followers are also His best leaders. Brothers and sisters, the strait and narrow path invariably leads past the poor and the needy. When Jesus says, &ldquo;Come, follow me,&rdquo; you know where He is going and who He is going to see. If you really want to see who needs you most, move away from the mirror and over to the window. Behold the poor and the needy! Opportunities aplenty, enough for many lifetimes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would those who are serious about discipleship development also be serious about caring for those in need? Jesus explained to his apostles, &ldquo;For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good.&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref19" target="_self"></a>19]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why will we always have the sick and infirm among us, not to mention folks with flat tires and friends who turn against them? Why these and many more in a seemingly endless line of people with challenges?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some day, perhaps when we see more clearly than we now do &ndash; or now can &ndash; we will appreciate how much those who needed us did for us. We need the needy. When they can give us nothing else, they can still give us the opportunity to serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As student disciples, your divine nature yearns to reach out to others and lift them up. I promise that not one day will go by this semester but what you will see someone in need. The poor and the needy do not always wear rags and look malnourished. If you look, you will see them &ndash; poor wayfaring men and women of grief, of heartache, of poor test grade, failed relationship, low self esteem, sagging hope, and more&hellip;who will often cross you on your way. Your disciple&rsquo;s heart will want to do something for them and you will do your best to give them what you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what will be the result? Will you succeed in succoring some? Surely you will. But, at the end of each day, notwithstanding your best effort, you will likely remember some you just could not or did not get to. Thus, unaided they move on, life&rsquo;s load one day heavier. If you do not understand the Lord&rsquo;s purpose in what is happening, you may become discouraged, wondering if it is all in vain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you must not overlook is what is happening to you, who you are becoming, while you are about the serious business of lifting arms and strengthening feeble knees. <sup>[<a name="endref20" target="_self"></a>20]</sup> For their labor the priests in Alma&rsquo;s day were to receive&hellip;grace. <sup>[<a name="endref21" target="_self"></a>21]</sup> In the process of doing what your discipleship demands of you, that is &ndash; praying, weeping, yearning, pondering, fasting, giving, and then giving some more to those in need&hellip;you will receive grace too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not in spite of the poor and needy that your discipleship will deepen; it is because of them &ndash; a tender case of we without them cannot be made perfect. <sup>[<a name="endref22" target="_self"></a>22]</sup> For your labor you modern day good Samaritan&rsquo;s receive the enabling power by which you can improve your student discipleship and eventually be perfected in Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the wounded and the weary, I would show a gentle heart is a day after day after day baptismal covenant. The very first ordinance of the gospel is received by the very first covenants including seeking out the poor and the needy. As Latter-day Saints, we are expected to bear one another&rsquo;s burdens, mourn with those that mourn, and comfort those in need of comfort, <sup>[<a name="endref23" target="_self"></a>23]</sup> compassionate disciples of Christ just trying to practice what His prophets preach!</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Fourth &ndash; Submissive student discipleship:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The year: 41 b.c. The place: Zarahemla and regions round about. The situation: the more humble part of the people suffering great persecutions and wading through much affliction. &ldquo;Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts to God.&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref24" target="_self"></a>24]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joy, consolation, purification and sanctification! How? How could they, given the persecution and affliction and all the day to day trials those surely suggest, how could joy and consolation fill their souls all the way to sanctification?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is lofty. It is at the heart of the Savior&rsquo;s atonement and the very essence of discipleship. Simply said, they yielded their hearts to God who then bestowed upon them peace, consolation, and hope &ndash; fruits which Christ&rsquo;s atonement made available and which their submission made accessible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many are the scriptural examples of disciples yielding their hearts to God in the most trying of times. One of the most touching is the Book of Mormon account of Amulek. <sup>[<a name="endref25" target="_self"></a>25]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obedient Amulek received the prophet Alma, into his house and submissive Amulek fed and cared for him many days saying, &ldquo;I know that thou [Alma] wilt be a blessing unto me and my house.&rdquo; Yielding Amulek went forth to preach and as he did he said of Alma, &ldquo;he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blessed?! Within a year, obedient Amulek had been imprisoned and submissive Amulek had forsaken all his gold, and silver, and his precious things and yielding Amulek had been rejected by those who were once his friends and also by his father and his kindred. Amulek was taken to the place of martyrdom to witness the destruction of the &ldquo;believers.&rdquo; Assuming that his wife and children did not deny their faith, then when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were being consumed in the fire, he was watching the very murder of his own family. And when he groaned to Alma, &ldquo;How can we witness this awful scene?&rdquo; he was really, really feeling those words!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In what for him, surely must have amounted to his own Gethsemane nightmare, Amulek did what all true disciples must do when called upon to do so&hellip;he bowed his head and through his tears, yielded his heart to God. How? It seems beyond mortal capacity. And it was. His strength did not come from man nor man&rsquo;s sorely limited understanding. Amulek&rsquo;s example would be and his strength surely was the Lord, Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No crown of thorns, no cruel cross,</p>
<p>Could make our great Redeemer shun;</p>
<p>He counted his own will but naught,</p>
<p>And said, &ldquo;Thy will O Lord be done.&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref26" target="_self"></a>26]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;Jesus set the example and invites us to follow saying, &ldquo;that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do&rdquo; <sup>[<a name="endref27" target="_self"></a>27]</sup> &ndash; &ldquo;Thy will, not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Amulek and like so many others in so many times and places, you student disciples here this evening have been invited and will be expected to yield your hearts to God and to do so in days both wonderful and terrible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surely there were 18 to 30 year-old saints in 41 B.C. Zarahemla. Their challenges were probably quite similar to your own. They likely struggled to get an education, lamented over the scarcity of well-paying jobs, fought back tears on bad-hair days, labored by day and by night in Church callings, and fought off temptations assailing from all sides. Some sought mightily to find and marry the right kind of person. Others, having married, then struggled to pay rent and maternity bills and to buy enough 1<sup>st</sup> Century b. c. disposable diaper equivalents to get them by till their next paycheck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your challenges may be similar <em>but</em> you will face them in a day when the intensity and sophistication of Satan&rsquo;s labors will be as they have never been before. You will see war on a scale that your counterparts in 41 b. c. never saw. You will see iniquity become more tolerated and more celebrated. You will experience more intense persecution, more natural calamities, and more unrestrained attacks on marriage and family than anyone in ancient America could ever have imagined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as you read of them in Zarahemla now, so will others in the future read about you, and I am confident that it will be some of the best student discipleship reading ever produced. And should any in that coming day wonder how you possibly did all you did notwithstanding the powers opposing you, they will understand when they read, &ldquo;Nevertheless, this generation of student disciples of 2010 did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, a welcome to Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho is also a welcome to student discipleship. Two ends of the same stick. That discipleship has already begun. Continuous, unconditional, compassionate, submissive &ndash; every day will see you engaged in, struggling with, and being blessed by one or more dimensions of student discipleship. And, if you are obedient and if you are patient and diligent, at some point the Spirit will give you a sacred glimpse into what these three or four years are really all about. Then you will see, perhaps for the first time, that student discipleship is not about earning the highest degree this university can confer but about inheriting the highest degree of glory God can give.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in this, as in every other upward, worthy endeavor, I witness that Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten of the Father, <em>is</em> your perfect example of student discipleship. He marked the path and led the way... <sup>[<a name="endref28" target="_self"></a>28]</sup> the way to the yielded heart. I so testify as I express my love for and confidence in each of you&hellip;in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I am grateful to be with you today.&nbsp; I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us and that you and I might be taught and edified by the Spirit.&nbsp;<br /><br />One summer many, many years ago, my mother decided it would be a great project for her children to refinish the dining room chairs.&nbsp; The chairs were painted a dark cherry color, and my mother had discovered that underneath that paint was good, hard maple wood.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I will never forget that experience.&nbsp; We began by applying a nasty solvent called toluene to all the painted surfaces, and then we scraped the paint off.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Once the paint was removed, we had to sand the wood with several grades of sandpaper in order to remove the very last bits of paint and to prepare the wood for a new finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When the sanding was finally done, we applied a finish to highlight the grain and enhance the wood's natural color.&nbsp; In the final step we sealed the new hardwood finish with two coats of varnish.&nbsp; Those chairs were transformed!&nbsp;<br /><br />I think about that experience every time I read Alma's penetrating question to the members of the Church in Zarahemla:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, are ye stripped of pride?&nbsp; I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God.&nbsp; Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.&nbsp;<sup>[</sup><sup>1]</sup></p>
<p>The words "are ye stripped of pride?" evoke in me images and smells from that summer.&nbsp; I think of toluene and scraping and stripping and sanding to get down to bare wood.&nbsp; When I think of the finishing process with a vibrant color and the protecting sealing varnish, I think of the description of the Savior as the "author and finisher of our faith"&nbsp;<sup>[</sup><sup>2]</sup>&nbsp;and the words of King Benjamin to his people:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his.&nbsp;<sup>[</sup><sup>3]</sup></p>
<p>My message today is about being stripped of pride.&nbsp; I want to talk with you about overcoming pride and becoming the humble followers of Christ.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Pride--The Universal Sin, the Great Vice</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Twenty years ago President Ezra Taft Benson delivered a powerful sermon on pride.&nbsp; It is a talk all of us should read carefully and often.&nbsp; Speaking in general conference, President Benson said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The central feature of pride is enmity--enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Enmity</em>&nbsp;means "hatred toward, hostility to, or a state of opposition."&nbsp; It is the power by which Satan wishes to reign over us. . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pride affects all of us at various times and in various degrees. . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pride is the universal sin, the great vice.&nbsp;<sup>[4]&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Pride in all of its manifestations has played a central role in the struggle between good and evil, a struggle going back to the War in Heaven.&nbsp; The seriousness of the sin of pride is rooted deep in the doctrines of salvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In premortality we lived with our Heavenly Father as spirit sons and daughters.&nbsp; In the premortal council, Heavenly Father presented His great plan of happiness through which we could obtain immortality and eternal life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our Father knew that all of us would sin and "come short of the glory of God,"&nbsp;<sup>[</sup><sup>5]</sup>&nbsp;so He sent His Beloved Son to atone for our sins, redeem us, and give us the strengthening power to become more like Him and our Father and ultimately receive the greatest gift of God--eternal life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the Great Truth in the Father's plan:&nbsp; Through the Atonement of Christ, we can receive peace, joy, happiness, and eternal life with our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; There is a Redeemer!&nbsp; Jesus Christ, the Holy One of Israel, is the only "name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God."&nbsp;<sup>[</sup><sup>6]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Father's plan was not received well by all of His children.&nbsp; Lucifer, a son of the morning, rebelled against the Father, against His Beloved Son, and against the plan.&nbsp; He presented his own proposal:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.&nbsp;<sup>[7]</sup></p>
<p>There are several things to note about Satan's proposal.&nbsp; 1) Satan would replace Christ; indeed, there was no need for Christ and no need for an atoning sacrifice at all.&nbsp; 2) There would be no agency.&nbsp; Everyone would be redeemed; no one would be lost.&nbsp; 3) It would surely happen, and Satan would be the sole reason why.&nbsp; 4) Therefore, he should have God's honor and glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Here, in stark contrast to the Father's plan and the Great Truth, was Satan's Great Lie:&nbsp; You can obtain joy, happiness, and eternal life without Christ, without God, and without any special effort on your part; and Satan would make all this happen without any sacrifice, pain, or suffering on his part--by the sheer force of his power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It was and is the Great Lie by the father of lies.&nbsp; It would not have worked.&nbsp; It was contrary to the will of the Father and to eternal laws of justice and mercy.&nbsp; And there, right in the middle of the Great Lie, at the very center of Satan's rebellious, diabolical scheme, was pride.&nbsp; There was pride and all of its sordid offspring--arrogance, selfishness, greed, vain ambition, unrighteous dominion--on a cosmic scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Father rejected Satan's proposal.&nbsp; Then driven by deep, deep pride and enmity toward the Father and the Son, Satan made war in heaven.&nbsp; He "accused [our brethren] before our God day and night"&nbsp;<sup>[8]</sup>&nbsp;and pushed the Great Lie with such deception and persuasion that a third part of the hosts of heaven followed him.&nbsp; But the forces of righteousness "overcame [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony."&nbsp;<sup>[9]</sup>&nbsp; And so Satan "was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."&nbsp;<sup>[10]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan continues his war against God and us in the mortal world where we are subject to the frailties, weaknesses, and temptations of the natural man.&nbsp; As it was in the pre-mortal realm, so it is on earth:&nbsp; pride is at the heart of Satan's war on God and on His children.&nbsp; It has been that way since the days of Adam.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But pride has become especially critical in our day.&nbsp; We live in the dispensation of the fulness of times when the Lord is blessing His children with great knowledge, remarkable technologies, expanded opportunities for learning, and unprecedented wealth.&nbsp; With these blessings, however, comes this warning from the Lord:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to give; but beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.&nbsp;<sup>[11]</sup></p>
<p>Beware of pride!&nbsp; This is the warning voice of the Lord to us now, in our day.&nbsp; We have obtained so much control over the resources of the earth, so much understanding of the biology of life, so much capacity to travel and to communicate instantly that we have become "puffed up" in our learning and our apparent control and power.&nbsp; Pride and its children--materialism, envy, arrogance, greed, thirst for recognition, and lust for control and dominion--have become rampant in our culture and society.&nbsp; Modern Babylon is awash in pride.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Book of Mormon prophets saw our day and spoke powerfully about modern-day pride.&nbsp; In his prophecy of the last days, Nephi saw that many would "be puffed up in their hearts"&nbsp;<sup>[12]</sup>&nbsp;and "wear stiff necks and high heads."<sup>&nbsp;</sup><sup>[13]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Hundreds of years later Moroni wrote these words about our day:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not.&nbsp; But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts.&nbsp;<sup>[14]</sup></p>
<p>The Book of Mormon was written for us.&nbsp; It bears witness of Jesus Christ and warns us of the perils of pride, both in prosperity and adversity.&nbsp; In the story of Laman and Lemuel, we see two proud brothers who murmured and rebelled and were filled with resentment and anger in the face of the loss of their home and possessions, their afflictions in the wilderness, and their failed expectations of leadership.&nbsp; Despite visits from angels and even the voice of the Lord and many other blessings and miracles, pride took root in their souls, their hearts were hardened, and they rejected the Lord and His prophets.&nbsp;<br /><br />We also see this same pattern of pride, hardness of heart, and rejection of the truth in the face of prosperity.&nbsp; Indeed, the Book of Mormon is a record of an entire people greatly favored of the Lord who succumbed to the temptations of pride, rejected the Lord, and were destroyed.&nbsp;<br /><br />The message is clear:&nbsp; Whether in prosperity or adversity, if we are not diligent and faithful, even the elect of God, even those greatly blessed by the Lord, can fall prey to the Great Lie and become hard-hearted, self-absorbed, stiff-necked, and puffed up in their pride.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is something we see all too often.&nbsp; You may have seen the interaction of pride and adversity among people you know.&nbsp; Perhaps because of some setback or a failed expectation or some other problem, a faithful member of the Church feels some resentment, some sense of being a victim unfairly treated.&nbsp; That resentment grows and festers and feeds on pride until it turns to anger and even bitterness.&nbsp; Over the years the member stops coming to Church, fails to keep the commandments, and finds ways to rationalize sinful behavior.&nbsp;<br /><br />Or perhaps you have seen the interaction of pride and prosperity.&nbsp; It happens to wonderful people who in their college years are full of promise.&nbsp; These are people of great ability and spirituality.&nbsp; They marry in the temple, obtain good employment, and prosper in their communities. &nbsp;They are blessed with beautiful children and wonderful family lives.&nbsp; They are active in the Church and serve in positions of responsibility.&nbsp;<br /><br />But something happens to them on the way to a life of service, joy, and happiness. &nbsp;What happens is pride.&nbsp; Somewhere along the way the honors of men, wealth, power, and recognition become more important than their love of the Lord, the love of their spouses and children, and their service in the kingdom.&nbsp; They divorce, leave the Church and their families, and become wholly worldly in their attitudes and their behavior.&nbsp;<br /><br />The effects of pride, whether in adversity or in prosperity, are deadly.&nbsp; As Alma prophesied:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction.&nbsp; Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.&nbsp;<sup>[15]</sup></p>
<p>This calamity comes little by little over time.&nbsp; Pride and its effects are like a thin film of darkness that begins to settle on the soul layer by layer, year by year, until the light of the gospel grows dim.&nbsp; Such people become hardened in their hearts, selfish in their behavior, and puffed up in the pride of their eyes.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is, of course, always hope.&nbsp; The proud and selfish souls can come back.&nbsp; But after years of darkness and so many layers of pride, it will take a lot of spiritual solvent and a lot of spiritual scraping and sanding to get down to a bare soul and a soft heart.&nbsp; And think of the time they have wasted, the opportunities for growth and becoming they have lost, the lives they could have saved, and the joy they could have received had they seen what was happening early on and acted on it to change. &nbsp;Had they just recognized those first thin films of pride, they might have repented and sought the Lord's redeeming power right then. &nbsp;Had they seen it and acted, they could have humbled themselves and been stripped of pride.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well did the Lord warn us: &nbsp;Beware of pride.&nbsp; Beware; be alert; be on guard against the perils of pride.&nbsp; May I suggest some things to watch for, some things of which we should all beware?&nbsp; I think of this list as red flags of pride. These red flags are like the little flags that landscapers put on the lawn when they have applied dangerous chemicals.&nbsp; Thin films of pride come with warning flags like the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Do you find yourself critiquing the talks in sacrament meeting?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Are you critical of others?&nbsp; Do you look down on others?&nbsp; Do you scorn or ridicule them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. When adversity strikes, do you hear a voice inside that says, "Why me?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Do you react to prophetic counsel by ignoring it, being upset by it, or interpreting it to suit your own desires?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. When you do something good, do you hear a voice inside congratulating yourself?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. Do you feel self-gratification and a sense of importance in your knowledge and skill?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">7. If someone you know receives something good, do you hear a voice inside saying, "What about me?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">8. Do you find ways to let others know of your success without appearing to boast?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">9. If someone corrects a mistake you made, do you feel defensive and resentful?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">10. When someone does something that creates inconvenience for you, do you feel annoyed?</p>
<p>I could go on.&nbsp; There are many, many red flags of pride.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I did not get this list from a book.&nbsp; I have firsthand experience with the questions I have asked you, and I know that if you and I ever feel any of them or hear any of them in our minds, we need to recognize them for what they are--the echoes of the Great Lie, the beginning of a call to enmity with our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />In that moment of recognition, we stand at a crossroads between two paths.&nbsp; We can follow the path of the Great Lie and act on those prideful feelings, or we can follow the path of the Great Truth and choose Christ.&nbsp; It is a choice.&nbsp; Are we going to keep our covenants, or are we going to break them?&nbsp; To reject the Great Lie and choose Christ takes an act of will.&nbsp; We have to consciously say to ourselves: "I am not going down the path of the Great Lie.&nbsp; With faith in Christ and with His help, I am going to walk the path of the Great Truth."&nbsp;<br /><br />Heavenly Father's plan to help us make that choice was beautifully summarized by Alma in his words to the people of Ammonihah:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering;&nbsp;<sup>[16]</sup></p>
<p>We must first catch ourselves in the moment when prideful thoughts or feelings come and then act in faith to choose Christ, seeking God's help in prayer.&nbsp; This is what Alma meant when he admonished us to "humble [ourselves] before the Lord . . . and watch and pray continually."&nbsp;<br /><br />But that is not the end.&nbsp; We must not only catch ourselves in prideful thoughts and feelings, not only choose Christ in that moment, but through the Atonement of Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost repent of our sins, receive forgiveness, and be led by the Holy Spirit to become "humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering."&nbsp;<br /><br />When we choose Christ, acting in faith to humble ourselves before Him, we put ourselves in the hands of the Master Finisher.&nbsp; As we do His will, He will help us be stripped of pride and become meek and lowly in heart, filled with His pure and perfect love.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord's finishing process may not be always pleasant.&nbsp; He will chasten and correct and give us experiences that polish us.&nbsp; If we are steadfast and immovable in doing what He wants us to do, we will not be deflected from the true path by adversity or prosperity.&nbsp; We will become the humble followers of Christ, and the day will come when He will seal us His.&nbsp;<br /><br />Being stripped of pride and becoming meek and lowly in heart is not easy.&nbsp; We cannot do it by ourselves.&nbsp; But there are patterns of life we can establish that will help us beware of pride, remember Christ, humble ourselves before Him, put ourselves in His hands, and have His love in our hearts.&nbsp; I will leave you today with four patterns:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pattern Number 1: Never do anything to drive the Spirit away.<br /></strong>The Holy Ghost is essential to the Lord's finishing process.&nbsp; But the Spirit is very sensitive to any degree of unrighteousness.&nbsp; Don't do anything or wear anything or say anything or read anything or listen to anything or watch anything or go anywhere that would drive the Spirit away.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pattern Number 2: Don't let the world get into your heart.<br /></strong>Never set your heart on things--on money or houses or cars or clothes or any other thing.&nbsp; Don't let a career or power or the honors of men get into your heart.&nbsp; They can get there very easily if you are not careful.&nbsp; Set your heart on the Lord and His kingdom, on your family and the temple and the things of eternity.&nbsp; Always live modestly within your means, and always pay your tithing and give a generous fast offering.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pattern Number 3: Serve the Lord.<br /></strong>Accept and always magnify callings in the Church and volunteer to be of service in the kingdom.&nbsp; When the promptings of the Spirit come sending you on the Lord's errand to rescue a lost soul or to comfort one in need, act on those promptings quickly as soon as you can.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pattern Number 4: Stand in Holy Places.<br /></strong>Make your home a sacred, holy place where the Spirit may dwell.&nbsp; Be in the chapel to partake of the sacrament every Sunday and prayerfully renew your covenant to "always remember him and keep his commandments."&nbsp;<sup>[17]</sup>&nbsp; If you live near a temple, go often to the house of the Lord.&nbsp; Relive those sacred ordinances and covenants.&nbsp; Reflect on your gratitude for the plan of salvation and for the Great Truth of the Atonement, on its power in your life, and on your need for the blessings and strength that are in the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I know that if we establish these patterns in our lives we will beware of pride, we will be true to our covenants, and we will be in the Master's hands.&nbsp; You and I have much work to do.&nbsp; The Lord is moving with power in the earth preparing us and the kingdom for His return.&nbsp; Given all the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, you and I need to be like Ammon, the son of Mosiah, a great and mighty missionary who said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things.&nbsp;<sup>[18]</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This combination of humility and courage is what we need, and it is precisely what comes to those who reject the Great Lie and humble themselves before the Lord.&nbsp; Listen to the way President Henry B. Eyring described the process that occurs when we remember the Great Truth of the Savior, put ourselves in His hands, and have His love in our hearts:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Those memories, if we choose to invite them, can produce a powerful blend of courage and meekness.&nbsp; No problem is too hard for us with his help.&nbsp; No price is too great to pay for what he offers us.&nbsp; And still in our greatest successes we feel as little children.&nbsp; And in our greatest sacri&iuml;&not;ces we still feel in his debt, wanting to give more.&nbsp; That is a humility which is energizing, not enervating.&nbsp; We can choose that shield as a protection against pride.&nbsp;<sup>[19]</sup></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, our protection, our hope, our salvation is in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; I bear witness of Him, the Holy One of Israel, the Light and the Life of the World.&nbsp; He is the Living Son of the Living God.&nbsp; This is His church and kingdom.&nbsp; I know that if we humble ourselves before Him and put ourselves in His Hands, we will be stripped of pride and He will polish us and finish us and seal us His.&nbsp; I know that is true.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I invoke the blessings of our loving Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son upon you this day, that you may become the humble followers of Christ and that the peace, joy, happiness, and power of Heaven may flow into your life and into the lives of your families and loved ones now and forever.&nbsp; In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>My dear young brothers and sisters, I am grateful for this opportunity to visit with you this afternoon, and, in the process, experience a homecoming of sorts to both the state and the college.</p>
<p>It is a homecoming to the state because I was born 30 miles south of here on the banks of the Snake River - in a hospital.&nbsp; Yes, there were hospitals back then.&nbsp; Incidentally, through the years I've mentioned to Margaret that I would also like to be buried on the banks of the Snake River; perhaps somewhere in Island Park.&nbsp; I would like a custom tombstone fitted with a metal bracket, into which my fly rod could be placed and positioned out over the river.&nbsp; On Memorial Day, as a fitting remembrance, Margaret could come up and tie on a new fly and read a few pages out of an LL Bean catalogue.&nbsp; She tells me that's a low probability event.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It's a homecoming to the college because I was a student here for one semester in the spring of 1964.&nbsp; Let me tell you how that happened, because it says something important about this institution that you are each a part of.&nbsp; In early February of 1964,&nbsp;&nbsp; I was serving as a French missionary in a small town south of Paris.&nbsp; On a Tuesday, I learned that my father had died of a heart attack.&nbsp; On Wednesday, I spent most of the day in a city park with my head in my hands, wondering what it might mean both near term and long term.&nbsp; On Thursday, I learned that since my mission was nearly over, I would be going home - so I packed my trunk and took a train to Paris.&nbsp; Friday morning I caught a flight to New York City and another flight to Salt Lake City.&nbsp; Friday at midnight, I got on a bus for Idaho Falls.&nbsp; I arrived at 6:00 a.m. Saturday morning and helped make final arrangements for my father's funeral, which started at noon that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Monday morning, I found myself here in Rexburg in the office of John Clark, who was president of what was then Ricks College.&nbsp; I explained that I wasn't sure why I had come, because I knew school had already been going for a week and I knew I had no money for tuition.&nbsp; But I told him I wanted very much to get an education.&nbsp; He put his arm around me and said, "Brother Nadauld, if you want an education we will help you."&nbsp; And he did!&nbsp;<br /><br />I went on to earn a bachelor's degree from BYU, a master's degree from Harvard Business School, and a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley.&nbsp; I don't know if any of that would have happened without President Clark and Ricks College and a willingness to help a young man get an education.&nbsp; So this institution means a great deal to me, and I hope it is becoming equally important in your lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is clear to all who know you both individually and collectively that you are young men and women of extraordinary capacity and ability.&nbsp; You have wonderful talents and gifts that you will be called upon to use on behalf of your families, your communities, and the Church. &nbsp;Earlier in my career, I was the director of the MBA program at BYU, and I associated with young people of great ability just like you.&nbsp; I admitted them to the program, taught them in class, and helped them find jobs.&nbsp; I believed in them because it was my responsibility and I supposed that they might amount to something, but I had no real data, no hard evidence to point to.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some years later I fulfilled Church assignments that, for a number of years, took me to many stakes scattered throughout the Church.&nbsp; In every assignment, I encountered former students who were relief society presidents, young women presidents, primary presidents, elders quorum presidents, scout masters, and in bishoprics and stake presidencies.&nbsp; They were community leaders, business leaders, and leaders of every other kind.&nbsp;<br /><br />My dear young brothers and sisters, I now have data.&nbsp; I have first-hand evidence, you are for real!&nbsp; You really are going to amount to something.&nbsp; You can count on it.&nbsp; You can take it to the bank!&nbsp;<br /><br />You are sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father who is even more sure of your success than I am.&nbsp; As such, you have been given two extraordinary and inestimable gifts that, if used wisely, will insure the ultimate outcomes you seek.&nbsp;<br /><br />I do not speak of bright minds, golden locks, winsome smiles and the ability to Google, text, tweet and program VCRs.&nbsp; I speak of the two most profound and fundamental of all given gifts - the understanding and exercising of which are crucial to your success.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first great gift, from the Father, given to each of you, is the gift of agency.&nbsp; It was given in our pre-mortal existence and has perhaps more power to explain our current circumstances, both macro and micro, than any other gospel principle.&nbsp; The gift of agency need not have been given.&nbsp; We read in Abraham 3:19:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And the Lord said unto me:&nbsp; These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all."</p>
<p>It is clear from our earthly experience that a more powerful and intelligent person can impose his will on a less intelligent person.&nbsp; That imposition can come as a physical, emotional or mental force or restraint.&nbsp; God, as the most intelligent of all, could have devised a way to subjugate all other spirits to His will.&nbsp; But He chose not to.&nbsp; Rather, He chose to give His children the incomparable gift of agency.&nbsp; How remarkable!&nbsp;<br /><br />Clear evidence that agency is a gift is found in a passage in the Book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price.&nbsp; We read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down" (Moses 4:3).</p>
<p>The gift of agency was given by God to man, and God was unwilling to see that gift destroyed by Satan's plan.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is important to note that Satan's plan, at least on the surface, was not unreasonable, as evidenced by the fact that one third of the hosts of heaven preferred it to the alternative.&nbsp; The arguments to support his plan were not trivial.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Undoubtedly, Satan pointed out that God was a just God and that those who made mistakes on earth would be punished.&nbsp; He surely argued that it was unreasonable to believe that God would sacrifice His Son for the ephemeral principle of agency.&nbsp; Perhaps he opined that it was equally unfathomable that anyone as powerful as God's Son would be willing to leave His vaulted station, be born in a stable, suffer incalculable pain in Gethsemane, be mocked, spit upon, and ultimately die an ignominious death on the cross.&nbsp; No, it wouldn't happen.&nbsp; It was too far fetched, too hard to believe.&nbsp; He suggested we would be born, we would experience uncertainty, fear, and anxiety.&nbsp; Christ would fail to perform.&nbsp; The Father's punishments for wrongdoing would be excruciating, long lasting, and without relief.&nbsp; It was a plan to be feared.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Agency should be rejected.&nbsp; It was a Pandora's Box filled with all the ills, plaques, troubles, trials and miseries we would find in a fallen world.&nbsp; It would be better to support a plan with a certain outcome.&nbsp; A certain plan would eliminate fear and uncertainty, and would guarantee the desired outcome to every person, " . . . that one soul shall not be lost . . . " (Moses 4:1).&nbsp; Surely everyone would see the brilliance of his plan and not worry about that one small inconvenience; namely, the total loss of agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />By contrast, the plan of the Father and Son was built firmly on the concept of agency.&nbsp; Man was free to choose in pre-mortality, and the gift of agency would continue into mortality.&nbsp; Yes, God was a just God and mistakes that were made would have to be paid for.&nbsp; But the payment could be made by a surrogate who would suffer the penalty on behalf of any errant soul who met specified conditions.&nbsp; Thus, uncertainty and its outcomes were not to be feared but to be embraced as the mechanism by which God's children would grow in stature, wisdom and judgment, and ultimately become exalted beings like He is.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The central role of Savior would be filled by God's Only Begotten in the flesh.&nbsp; He was anointed to the task, He pledged to do it, and He could be counted on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This gift of His Son would be God's second but unquestionably THE greatest gift.&nbsp; Without the assurance of a Savior and an atoning sacrifice, the gift of agency in mortality would likely not have been accepted.&nbsp; It would have been too risky, with too many penalties, too much suffering, too little likelihood of success, and too much to fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Thus, the battle lines were drawn.&nbsp; As the scriptures describe:&nbsp; "And there was war in heaven:&nbsp; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven" (Revelation 12:7-8).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The war was not a conventional war, with rockets, land mines, and jet fighters.&nbsp; It was a war of ideas and concepts.&nbsp; It was fought over conflicting plans for redemption, over who would be in charge, and over the gift of agency.&nbsp; It was fought over two different visions for the future experiences and ultimate outcomes of the spirit children of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Book of Revelation provides a wonderful insight into how the war in heaven was won.&nbsp; " . . . neither was there place found in heaven for the great dragon who was cast out; that old serpent called the devil and also called Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: &nbsp;he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.&nbsp; And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation and strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night:&nbsp; For they have overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony . . ." (JST, Revelation 12:6-11).&nbsp;<br /><br />As I have written elsewhere about this passage, the great pre-mortal conflict was won not by force or by abrogating agency, but by testifying that an atonement would be wrought by the shedding of the blood of Christ.&nbsp; Assurances were given that Christ would fulfill His role in the plan.&nbsp; The fears promoted by Satan and his followers were overcome by the faith and testimony of Michael and his hosts.&nbsp; Agency was not to be feared, but embraced.&nbsp; Mistakes made on earth could be forgiven and the punishments affixed would be paid for by the suffering and spilt blood of Jesus Christ, Savior and Redeemer of all mankind.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the end, the polar positions of fear and faith were incompatible; they could not co-exist.&nbsp; God exercised His power and separated the two opposing forces.&nbsp; Satan and the one-third who followed him were "cast out."&nbsp; They became the devil and his angels.&nbsp; The "casting out" did not end the war.&nbsp; It was in some sense only the beginning.&nbsp; The war in heaven was the first great battle in a long, protracted struggle.&nbsp; The devil has not conceded defeat.&nbsp; He is still fighting a war.&nbsp; Essentially a war over how you will use the Father's two great gifts - the first, the gift of agency, and the greatest gift, the gift of His atoning Son.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />That should not be news to you, and the extraordinary young people of your generation.&nbsp; Never in history has the gift of agency been more abundantly manifested.&nbsp; Never has the concept of agency been expressed in such an unbelievable spectrum of alternatives and choices.&nbsp; The possibilities for self expression through physical, mental, emotional and spiritual exploration seem endless.&nbsp; I submit to you that your Heavenly Father cares about all your choices, but He cares about some more than others.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first great gift you were given was not the gift of free agency but the gift of moral agency.&nbsp; In the Book of Mormon, Alma observes:&nbsp; "Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they having first transgressed the first commandments as to things which were temporal, and becoming as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good" (Alma 12:31).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />God is most interested in the exercise of agency relative to both knowing good from evil and more importantly doing good or evil.&nbsp; This is the classic definition of morality - or moral agency - choosing between good and evil.&nbsp; Yes, you are free to choose, but you are not free from the consequences of your choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So the issue is not the red car or blue car, the Ford or the Chevy, fly or drive, or perhaps even Jane or Jill, or school teacher versus computer programmer.&nbsp; You can expect to receive help with both little and big decisions, but as you exercise your agency across the huge number of options that you are blessed with in your generation, consider focusing your greatest attention on those that require you to discern and choose between good and evil, right and wrong.&nbsp; These are the judgments that will make you wise and qualify you for the blessings promised by your Heavenly Father.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It's possible at your age to feel somewhat anxious and maybe a little worn out by all the exercise of agency that you have to do.&nbsp; Just as running or weightlifting or any vigorous physical exercise can leave our bodies temporarily fatigued, so can all this deciding decisions and choosing choices make us emotionally worn out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />On a bad day, you may think it's just too hard to figure all this out.&nbsp; School is too hard; life is too hard.&nbsp; I don't know which classes to take or what to major in.&nbsp; I just want to go back and work in the Dairy Queen.&nbsp; How can I figure out which girl to marry?&nbsp; Man, they're all a mystery to me!&nbsp; Or, when is this guy ever going to ask me out - men are just so clueless!&nbsp; I just wish someone would tell me what to do and I would do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This notion of wishing we didn't have to decide or that someone else would decide for us is not uncommon.&nbsp; We've all felt it.&nbsp; But the cloistered monastic earth life is not the way to eternal exalted celestial life.&nbsp; Embrace the gift of choice; do not wish it away.&nbsp; Do not cede it to someone else.&nbsp; The gift of agency is not to be feared, as Satan would have you believe.&nbsp; Embrace it, with joy and thanksgiving.&nbsp; Relish the opportunity to choose a career, to choose a companion, and to choose where to live.&nbsp; Relish even more the opportunity to make correct moral choices - to choose good over evil.&nbsp; God will help you in all choices.&nbsp; He will exalt you as a result of correct moral choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As you are busy choosing, remember you have received another gift - a third gift if you will - the gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; You may hope for the Holy Ghost to tell you what to do and wonder why, in the process, He speaks with such a still small voice.&nbsp; Consider this:&nbsp; He speaks with a barely discernable still small voice to honor your agency.&nbsp; Any louder voice would abrogate - would take away - your agency.&nbsp; Only in exceptional circumstances is the Holy Ghost authorized to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So you can pray to be told what to do, but it doesn't usually work very well.&nbsp; Instead, perhaps you could consider praying for better or more information.&nbsp; Acknowledge in your prayers that you will gladly exercise your agency, but you would be grateful for more facts - and then put forth the effort to seek them.&nbsp; You will be guided in that effort.&nbsp; Pray for someone wise to counsel with, and then be humble enough to give sincere and honest attention to the counsel you receive.&nbsp; Pray for discernment, that you might separate valid information and counsel given in love from that information that might be given to confuse or even deceive.&nbsp; Pray to perceive which decisions have moral implications, and be especially attentive to them.&nbsp; Remember, it is your learning to choose between good and evil that God is especially interested in.&nbsp;<br /><br />As you go forward to grow in wisdom, stature and judgment, will you make the right choice every time?&nbsp; Can you anticipate the unintended consequences of even the most well-considered decisions?&nbsp; Are you immune from the pain and anguish of choices made by others?&nbsp; The answers to these three interrogatories are: not likely, not hardly, and no way! (in other words, no, no, and no!).&nbsp; You might even imagine an impish voice saying, "You make lousy choices, you're going to fail, and, see, I told you so."&nbsp;<br /><br />That's the time to remind yourself how the war in heaven was won:&nbsp; "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony" (Revelation 12:11).&nbsp; It was won by the atoning sacrifice of the Savior and by the testimony, witnesses and assurances of those individuals who stood on the side of Michael and his angels.&nbsp; And who exactly were those individuals?&nbsp; They were you - every one of you.&nbsp; Your strategy then was to focus on the Savior, to believe His atonement was key to the plan and that it would work in your life.&nbsp; That is exactly the strategy you should employ today, here and now.&nbsp; The Savior's role is not only to forgive sins but to comfort, strengthen, and buoy up each of us as we encounter the normal vicissitudes of life that are inextricably associated with the exercise of agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Father's greatest gift, the atoning sacrifice of His Son, allows us to use His first gift, that of agency, with confidence.&nbsp; You can go forward with faith, not fear.&nbsp; You have used your agency wisely in a pre-mortal state.&nbsp; You can do it again here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me conclude my remarks today with a wonderful vignette found in the Book of Moses that describes a conversation between Enoch and God.&nbsp; Beginning with Moses 7:27, we read:&nbsp; "And Enoch beheld angels descending out of heaven, bearing testimony of the Father and Son; and the Holy Ghost fell on many, and they were caught up by the powers of heaven into Zion" (Moses 7:27).&nbsp;<br /><br />Any parent who has anticipated the coming home of a child can imagine how our Heavenly Father must have felt as He saw many of His righteous children returning to His and their heavenly home.&nbsp; There was undoubtedly great rejoicing, as is present in any reunion between loved ones.&nbsp; Our contemplation of the sweetness of such reunions provides a dramatic backdrop for what happens next.&nbsp; The next verses explain:&nbsp; "And it came to pass that the God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people, and he wept; and Enoch bore record of it, saying:&nbsp; How is it that the heavens weep, and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains?&nbsp; And Enoch said unto the Lord:&nbsp; How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?" (Moses 7:28-29)&nbsp;<br /><br />Enoch is clearly perplexed.&nbsp; Hadn't God just welcomed home many of His spirit children?&nbsp; Why, as He looked upon the residue of the people, would He weep?&nbsp; Enoch could not immediately understand why someone who was holy and whose power and understanding spread from "all eternity to all eternity" would be found weeping.&nbsp;<br /><br />In his struggle to comprehend, Enoch continues to rehearse some of what he knows about God as additional context to his astonishment.&nbsp; We read in verse 30:&nbsp; "And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations; and thy curtains are stretched out still; and yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; and also thou art just; thou art merciful and kind forever" (Moses 7:30).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Enoch not only reviews the vastness of God's physical creations but also pauses to remind himself of the vastness of God's other attributes, such as justice, mercy, and kindness.&nbsp; He then continues:&nbsp; "And thou hast taken Zion to thine own bosom, from all thy creations, from all eternity to all eternity; and naught but peace, justice, and truth is the habitation of thy throne; and mercy shall go before thy face and have no end; how is it thou canst weep?" (Moses 7:31)&nbsp;<br /><br />From Enoch's perspective, an all-powerful, all-knowing God, whose attributes include peace, justice, truth, and mercy, should have no conceivable reason ever to weep or ever to be sad.&nbsp; In modern vernacular, we might think of Enoch as saying, You are a huge success!&nbsp; You have cars, houses, and money.&nbsp; You are good and wise and kind.&nbsp; Why would you be unhappy?&nbsp;<br /><br />God's answer should give us powerful reason to pause and contemplate:&nbsp; "The Lord said unto Enoch:&nbsp; Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency" (Moses 7:32).&nbsp;<br /><br />God is explaining to Enoch that all those who were not taken up into His bosom are also the workmanship of His own hands.&nbsp; They are His children whom He had created, to whom He had given knowledge, and to whom He had given the incomparable gift of agency.&nbsp; The implication is clearly that He cares about them and loves them.&nbsp; God's love for His children and His desire to see them all come home to Him makes the final verses especially poignant.&nbsp; God says:&nbsp; "And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another,&nbsp;<em>and that they should choose me, their Father;&nbsp;</em>but behold, they are without affection, and they hate their own blood" (Moses 7:33; emphasis added).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now it is clear why God has wept.&nbsp; He has only one desire for His children.&nbsp; He has created them, endowed them with knowledge, and given them agency.&nbsp; He desires only that they&nbsp;<em>choose Him,&nbsp;</em>their Father.&nbsp; He wants only that those children whom He loves so much return that affection and choose to love Him back.&nbsp; And when they choose to be&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;affection for Him or for their own children, He has cause to weep.&nbsp;<br /><br />Surely you understand the poignancy of this story and the implication for each of us.&nbsp; God loves us as every parent loves a child.&nbsp; His only wish is for our success and happiness.&nbsp; Of all the wonderful and extravagant gifts that the Creator of the Universe could give His children, He has chosen the two that He deems the most important - the gift of agency and the gift of the Atonement.&nbsp; His most profound and heartfelt desire is the same as any parent's - that in all our choosing we choose Him.&nbsp; We choose to value what He values, to love who He loves, and to live where He lives; to choose Him, to dine with Him, to use our gifts wisely and well - those are His desires for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My dear young brothers and sisters, go forward with faith and courage.&nbsp; Know that you are supported by the love of your family and Church leaders.&nbsp; Know especially of the love of your Father in Heaven.&nbsp; My prayer for you is that, as you exercise your God-given gift of agency in this life, you will choose Him - in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Associate Academic VP of Academic Development</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A few months ago, I got a new position here at BYU-Idaho--a position I'd neither sought nor anticipated.&nbsp; In fact, I'd left behind a very rewarding career in the legal and corporate world in order to teach religion full-time, which I felt was the best job in the world.&nbsp; So I genuinely struggled to accept an appointment that would pull me away from the classroom, even though my new assignment was certainly worthwhile.<br /><br />But then I was told that someone I deeply respect had said that I had been prepared for this particular position through experiences I'd had in my life.&nbsp; As I came to understand the truth of that statement, it helped me view both my new job and my past experiences in a different light.&nbsp; Now as I help lead an effort to explore how we might extend the blessings of higher education to members of the Church who may never come to Rexburg, I see past chapters of my life quite differently, whether it's the Spanish class I took a couple of years ago or my project management experience as an executive or my service as an institute director.&nbsp; A career path that once looked twisted now makes much more sense to me.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've thought a lot about this principle of preparation in the last few months--not because preparatory experiences are somehow unique to me, but because precisely the opposite is true.&nbsp; In the kingdom of God, preparatory experiences are an essential part of the Lord's plan for each of us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here's what now President Henry B. Eyring said about how the Lord prepares each of us for opportunities in life:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Part of the tragedy that you must avoid is to discover too late that you missed an opportunity to prepare for a future only God could see for you. . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Your life is carefully watched over, as was mine.&nbsp; The Lord knows both what He will need you to do and what you will need to know.&nbsp; He is kind and He is all-knowing.&nbsp; So, you can with confidence expect that He has prepared opportunities for you to learn in preparation for the service you will give.&nbsp;<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p>I know that what President Eyring taught is true.&nbsp; Heavenly Father knows each of us intimately, and He has a work for each of us to do.&nbsp; I was struck by the simplicity and power of this statement I recently read in the&nbsp;<em>Gospel Principles</em>&nbsp;manual:&nbsp; "our Father in Heaven knows who we are and what we did before we came here.&nbsp; He has chosen the time and place for each of us to be born so we can learn the lessons we personally need and do the most good with our individual talents and personalities."&nbsp;<sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp; The Lord also knows what storms lie ahead for us.&nbsp; What He said to the brother of Jared before he embarked on his stormy journey to a land of promise might be said figuratively to all of us as we embark on sometimes stormy journeys of our own to eternal lands of promise: &nbsp;"And behold, I prepare you against these things; for ye cannot cross this great deep save I prepare you against the waves of the sea, and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which shall come."<sup>&nbsp;[3]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Whether it is trials that would otherwise be impossible to bear or missions that would otherwise be impossible to fulfill, the Lord has promised:&nbsp; "I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments."<sup>&nbsp;[4]</sup>&nbsp; As Nephi concluded from his own life experience, "[T]he Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men . . . ."&nbsp;<sup>[5]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Today I'd like to talk about seven different ways the Lord helps prepare us to accomplish his work.&nbsp; My hope is that our discussion will enable us to better recognize and take advantage of the many kinds of preparatory opportunities the Lord has placed in each of our paths.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Predecessors<br /></strong>Few figures loom larger in scripture than Moses.&nbsp; But we owe his life to some women whose own contributions are all too often overlooked.&nbsp; First, there were Shiphrah and Puah, the Hebrew midwives whom Pharaoh commanded to kill every male baby born to the Israelites.&nbsp; Fearing God more than Pharaoh, these courageous women ignored Pharaoh's gruesome edict, undoubtedly at the peril of their own lives.&nbsp;<sup>[6]</sup>&nbsp; Pharaoh then commanded all the people to kill the sons who were born,&nbsp;<sup>[7]</sup>&nbsp;but Moses' mother, Jochebed, also bravely defied this unjust law.&nbsp; Finally, we sense goodness in Pharaoh's daughter when she was moved with compassion to draw Moses out of the water.&nbsp;<sup>[8]</sup>&nbsp; Without the courage and compassion of each of these preparatory predecessors, Moses would never have been able to fulfill the work he had been foreordained to do.</p>
<p>What principles can we glean from these preparatory predecessors? &nbsp;If we are not careful, we may find it all too easy to take for granted the contributions of forerunners who have built the foundations on which we stand.&nbsp; What historian David McCullough said about the privilege of being a U.S. citizen reminds me of the debts we owe to many who have gone before us:The laws we live by, the freedoms we enjoy, the institutions that we take for granted . . . are all the work of other people who went before us. &nbsp;And to be indifferent to that isn't just to be ignorant, it's to be rude. &nbsp;And ingratitude is a shabby failing. &nbsp;How can we not want to know about the people who have made it possible for us to live as we live, to have the freedoms we have, to be citizens of this greatest of countries in all time? &nbsp;It's not just a birthright, it is something that others struggled for, strived for, often suffered for, often were defeated for and died for, for us, for the next generation.&nbsp;<sup>[9]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of us has been blessed by preparatory predecessors who have gone before us, often blessing our lives in ways we may not remember or even realize.&nbsp; There are Primary teachers whose faces we no longer recall even though they taught us eternal principles we will never forget.&nbsp; Each night as I exit the Kimball Building, I walk past the images of each of the men who has presided over this university.&nbsp; On my best days, I utter a prayer of thanks for them as I pass, because I know that without their sacrifice, we would not be here today.&nbsp; Recognizing the roles of such predecessors in my life fills my heart with gratitude toward both them and the Lord who placed them there.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mentors<br /></strong>The scriptures and Church history are replete with examples of great men and women whose lives were blessed by mentors, individuals who helped prepare them for the missions they were to perform.&nbsp; Mary had Elizabeth, Joshua had Moses, Joseph Smith had Moroni, and Peter had the Savior.&nbsp; I'd like to focus briefly on a tale of two mentors in the Old Testament.&nbsp; Elisha was both a servant to and a disciple of the great prophet Elijah.&nbsp;<sup>[10]</sup>&nbsp; He followed his prophetic mentor faithfully, and when Elijah was taken from the earth, his mantle passed both literally and figuratively to Elisha, his trusted servant.</p>
<p>As prophet, Elisha had a servant of his own named Gehazi.&nbsp; Elisha trusted Gehazi enough that on one occasion, in an extraordinary act of delegation, he gave Gehazi his staff and commissioned him to journey to raise a boy from the dead.&nbsp;<sup>[11]</sup>&nbsp; Although Gehazi was unsuccessful, the mere fact that Elisha gave him such an assignment demonstrates the incredible level of trust this prophet placed in his servant.&nbsp; Elisha had been given extraordinary opportunities by Elijah, and now he was giving extraordinary opportunities to his own servant.&nbsp;<br /><br />But the story of the relationship between Elisha and Gehazi is poignantly instructive because Gehazi failed to take full advantage of the rare privilege he had of working intimately with a prophet of God.&nbsp; It's a story of opportunity lost, of a mentor squandered.&nbsp; The critical moment for Gehazi came shortly after Naaman, the leprous Syrian, was healed by Elisha by washing himself seven times in the River Jordan.&nbsp; Grateful that he'd been healed, Naaman sought to reward Elisha with gifts.&nbsp; Elisha refused steadfastly, as any man of God would.&nbsp; But the lure of the gifts Naaman offered proved too much for Gehazi.&nbsp; He waited until Naaman departed and then sneaked off after him.&nbsp; He lied to Naaman to get some of the gifts for himself; then he lied to his master, Elisha, to conceal his sin.&nbsp; The disappointment in Elisha's voice is almost palpable when he rebukes Gehazi:&nbsp; "Went not mine heart with thee, when [Naaman] turned again from his chariot to meet thee?"&nbsp;<sup>[12]</sup>&nbsp; Rather than receive Elisha's mantle as a blessing, Gehazi received Naaman's leprosy as a curse.&nbsp;<br /><br />What principles can we glean from this tale of two servants and their mentors?&nbsp; First, I believe that each of us is blessed with potential mentors who can play important roles in preparing us to accomplish the work the Lord would have us to do.&nbsp; Understanding this leads me to ask, "What potential mentors has the Lord placed in my life right now?"&nbsp; Each of us might ask at various seasons in our lives, "What can I learn from my teachers, my priesthood leaders, my spouse, or my friends that might help prepare me for my mission in life?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Second, never squander a good mentor.&nbsp; Some opportunities come along in life just once, including the opportunity to be mentored by certain individuals.&nbsp; I have heard Elder Robert D. Hales say, "We will all have educational and other opportunities that can prepare us to contribute to the Lord's kingdom in unique and important ways<em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We have to understand that sometimes we will find ourselves in the right place at the right time.&nbsp; We have to take advantage of those opportunities; they only come once."&nbsp; (By the way, my favorite address on the subject of mentors is one given by then Elder Henry B. Eyring at a BYU devotional in 1993 entitled, "To Choose and Keep a Mentor," and it's available online.)&nbsp;<sup>[13]</sup>&nbsp; I am convinced the Lord places wise individuals in our paths who can be our tutors in life if we let them.&nbsp; We are richly blessed when we recognize such mentors and learn all we can from them.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Course Corrections<br /></strong>When I was about 16 years old my younger sister, Jennifer, and I had great difficulty getting along.&nbsp; Of course, the reason for this was that Jen was being a little brat.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my parents were blinded by their love for their daughter and could not see this, so they often scolded me for not getting along better with my sister.&nbsp; Then one day one of my best friends, Sid Beers, told me something I'll never forget:&nbsp; "Rob, you really ought to be nicer to your sister."&nbsp; My parents' pleas had had little effect, but Sid's comment pierced my heart.&nbsp; I honestly can't remember whether I changed because I felt guilty or because I wanted to show Sid that&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;really wasn't the problem.&nbsp; But I changed.&nbsp; And as soon as I changed the way I treated Jen, our relationship improved instantly, proving that Sid was right.&nbsp; I often wonder whether I would have ever enjoyed the wonderful relationship with my sister I do now had Sid not offered his bold observation.</p>
<p>Here's one more story of preparatory corrective counsel coming from a peer.&nbsp; When President Clark was in high school, he was in a very successful band.&nbsp; Yes, it was a rock band.&nbsp; On the way home from winning a battle of the bands in his native Spokane, Washington, young Kim Clark was with a friend who cared enough to tell him the truth.&nbsp; She said, "You know, you are becoming two people. You're really different when you are around the band."&nbsp; &nbsp;He realized she was right and decided that day to quit the band.&nbsp; The rest is history.&nbsp;<sup>[14]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Clark is indebted to that candid friend, just as I am indebted to Sid.&nbsp; Such preparatory corrective counsel may come from parents, professors or priesthood leaders, but I have found that the comments of peers--friends, roommates, companions, colleagues, and fellow students--are often the most powerful.&nbsp; Whatever the source, we are blessed when we change our course in life based on the wise corrective counsel we receive from those who love us enough to help steer us in a better direction.&nbsp;<br /><br />Such stories lead me to ask, "What helpful corrective counsel might I be overlooking from those the Lord has placed in my life?"&nbsp; We may also wish to consider the corollary principle:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do I know someone who could use some course correction that I am better situated to provide than anyone else?"&nbsp; I am certainly not suggesting that we all have license to pop off with life advice for everyone who crosses our path.&nbsp; In fact, if we're to be helpful rather than harmful, we need to carefully consider both how and why we give corrective counsel.&nbsp; But when we are prompted to do so and motivated by love, we can provide important corrective counsels in the lives of others by helping them see something they may have become blinded to themselves.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Educational Opportunities<br /></strong>There is a passage in the 88<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;section of the Doctrine and Covenants that has been near to my heart for much of my life.&nbsp; The Lord begins this famous passage in verse 78 by saying, "Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."&nbsp; He then provides a sweeping list of things we should study--a list which actually matches up quite well with the variety of things many of you might be learning about during your years at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>The last item on the list in verse 79 is "a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."&nbsp; But note that the verse ends with a dash, not a period.&nbsp; That dash tells us the thought is not yet complete.&nbsp; We find the rest of the sentence in verse 80, and it's an explanation of why we should learn so many different kinds of things.&nbsp; "<em>That ye may be prepared</em>&nbsp;in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you."&nbsp; I believe the Lord provides us with educational opportunities so that we will be prepared to fulfill the missions He gives each of us in mortality.&nbsp; Whether we learn to sing or draw or design things or analyze the human mind or speak new languages or understand the history of nations, we are developing skills and knowledge the Lord can call upon to build His kingdom.&nbsp; Those who understand this principle do not take such preparatory opportunities lightly.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Of course, as we navigate through life's endless possibilities, knowing which educational opportunities to pursue can be a daunting task.&nbsp; But our patriarchal blessings often provide invaluable guidance that can help us identify which opportunities we should pursue.&nbsp; As President Thomas S. Monson has taught, patriarchal blessings "contain chapters from your life's book of possibilities."&nbsp;<sup>[15]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I do not know what particular missions you will be called on to perform in life, but I know that you will be called upon.&nbsp; And when you are, it would be a shame to be unprepared.&nbsp; Winston Churchill put it this way, "To every man there comes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that special moment when he is figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a special thing unique to him and fitted to his talent.&nbsp; What a tragedy if that moment finds him unprepared or unqualified for the work which would be his finest hour."<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Divinely Directed Diversions<br /></strong>You may recall the Old Testament story in 1 Samuel 9 and 10 of how the prophet Samuel anointed Saul to be king.&nbsp; What intrigues me about that story is how Saul ended up crossing paths with the prophet.&nbsp; Saul's father had lost some donkeys and he sent Saul and a servant to find them.&nbsp; They traipsed across the countryside in pursuit of the animals.&nbsp; Eventually, they found themselves near the hometown of Samuel, so they sought out the prophet to seek help in finding their donkeys.&nbsp; By the time they found Samuel, he told them the asses had already safely returned home.&nbsp; But the Lord had told the prophet that Saul was really there for a much more important reason--to be anointed to rule over all Israel.<sup>&nbsp;[16]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems the Lord used the wandering donkeys to get Saul where he needed to be.&nbsp; They were, in essence, a divinely directed diversion.</p>
<p>Sometimes such diversions take the form of storms that redirect our paths.&nbsp; This was literally the case in the life of Parley P. Pratt.&nbsp; As a young man, Parley set out for the Western frontier beyond Detroit, but a winter storm made it impossible for him to get any further than 30 miles west of Kirtland, Ohio, where he ended up settling.&nbsp;<sup>[17]</sup>&nbsp; It was only 18 months later that Sidney Rigdon came preaching in Parley's Ohio neighborhood&nbsp;<sup>[18]</sup>&nbsp;--something that never would have happened had Parley reached his destination of choice west of Detroit.&nbsp; Sidney's preaching prepared Parley, and Parley returned the favor after joining the Church.&nbsp; Parley's first stop on his mission was in Kirtland, where hundreds of those he taught accepted the restored gospel, including Sidney Rigdon and many from his congregation.&nbsp;<sup>[19]</sup>&nbsp; Brother Pratt would later serve as an apostle and would help convert John Taylor.&nbsp;<br /><br />What can we learn from the experiences of Saul and Parley?&nbsp; In the case of Saul, we learn that sometimes we may be led to a new place in our lives for what we assume is one reason, when the Lord has actually led us there for a much more important purpose.&nbsp; Such divinely directed diversions can be an important tool to get us to places we otherwise might never have sought out ourselves.&nbsp; If our vision is too narrow, we may find ourselves frustrated at times, just as some members of Zion's Camp were when they weren't allowed to do battle in Missouri.&nbsp; But when we ask Heavenly Father to help us recognize His purposes, we often discover hidden benefits and designs in life's inspired diversions.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the case of Parley, the cause he had chosen for himself was a good one, but the Lord had an even greater cause in store for him.&nbsp; The Lord often has better places and grander purposes in mind for us than we have in mind for ourselves.&nbsp; In my own life, I have repeatedly experienced the Lord diverting me from paths and plans I had chosen for myself, redirecting me instead to higher purposes.&nbsp; Sometimes such divine diversions in our lives will be the result of storms that appear to be devastating setbacks when we encounter them, preventing us from going where we had planned to go.&nbsp; The woman or man you are dating may dump you, but when that happens, the Lord usually has a better match in store for you.&nbsp; Success on the admissions test for the graduate school of your choice may evade you, but that may mean that the Lord has an even more fulfilling career ahead for you in a field you might have otherwise overlooked.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Afflictions<br /></strong>When President Dieter F. Uchtdorf was just 11 years old, he worked as a laundry delivery boy.&nbsp; He had to pedal so hard pulling a heavy cart behind his clunky workhorse of a bicycle that he sometimes thought his lungs would burst.&nbsp; It wasn't until he joined the German Air Force many years later that he realized how his childhood affliction would create a lifelong blessing.&nbsp; Doctors who examined him discovered evidence of lung disease that had been healed, and they wondered what treatment he had received for it.&nbsp; President Uchtdorf had received no medical treatment for his lung disease, because hadn't even known he had the disease.&nbsp; He realized then that without his hard work in the fresh air as a child, he would never have become a pilot.&nbsp;<sup>[20]&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;We might add that he also would never have become the senior vice president of flight operations for Lufthansa, one of the largest airlines in the world--an experience that undoubtedly prepared him, in turn, for his current administrative responsibilities as a member of the First Presidency.</p>
<p>What can we learn from President Uchtdorf's experience?&nbsp; We all suffer afflictions, and in our moments of trial we may be tempted to ask, "Why me?&nbsp; Why didn't the Lord spare me this challenge?"&nbsp; But when we recognize that the Lord often uses afflictions to prepare us for future opportunities, we view our momentary afflictions in a different light.&nbsp; We remember the Lord's promise to Joseph Smith as he languished in Liberty Jail:&nbsp; "all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."&nbsp;<sup>[21]</sup>&nbsp; When we recognize the preparatory role afflictions can play in our lives, instead of asking in despair "Why me?" we are more likely to ask in faith, "What wouldst Thou have me learn from this?"&nbsp;<br /><br />A few years ago, neighbors who frequently hired our daughter, Elizabeth, as a babysitter, complimented us on what a wonderful daughter we had.&nbsp; They asked what we had done to raise a young woman who felt so comfortable interacting with adults.&nbsp; I immediately began a mental scan of our parenting strategies to see which one might explain this particular positive outcome.&nbsp; But my review was cut short by a gentle rebuke from the Spirit: &nbsp;"Do you think visiting and serving her grandmother and other elderly people every week for several years might have had something to do with this?"&nbsp; At the time, my mother was engaged in a decade-long bout with a particularly nasty, strain of Alzheimer's that impaired not only her memory but her perception of reality.&nbsp; I confess that if it had been up to me, I would have chosen to lose my mother to a heart attack instead.&nbsp; But in that moment, I couldn't help but think about how my daughter had been shaped and blessed over that decade of affliction by serving and loving my mother and other elderly people.&nbsp; Indeed, even after my mother passed away, my children have chosen to continue our family tradition of singing together every Sunday afternoon with our friends the Thomases to residents of the assisted living facility where my mother spent her final two years.&nbsp; As I watch Elizabeth interact in a remarkably mature and caring way with these precious children of God, I recognize that my mother's prolonged suffering played a preparatory role in my family's life in ways I did not fully appreciate at the time.&nbsp; This experience has helped me better obey the command to "thank the Lord thy God in all things[,]"&nbsp;<sup>[22]</sup>&nbsp;including preparatory afflictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">Resources<br /></strong>I recently stumbled upon a fact that has heightened my appreciation for Nephi's faith when the Lord commanded him to build a ship:&nbsp; the type of iron ore that can be smelted at low temperatures is a rare commodity in the Arabian Peninsula.&nbsp;<sup>[23]</sup>&nbsp; So when Nephi asked where he should go to find ore to molten,&nbsp;<sup>[24]</sup>&nbsp;he wasn't just demonstrating his eagerness to get to work.&nbsp; He was also expressing his complete confidence that the Lord had guided his family to one of the few spots on the entire Arabian Peninsula where he could find the necessary ore, along with everything else he would need to build and launch a ship.</p>
<p>What principles can we glean from this?&nbsp; We all remember Nephi's famous answer to the Lord's request that he return to Jerusalem to fetch the plates.&nbsp; We sometimes simplify 1&nbsp;Nephi&nbsp;3:7 to this basic principle:&nbsp; the Lord won't command us to do anything we can't accomplish.&nbsp; But what Nephi actually said is "that the Lord giveth no commandment unto the children of men,&nbsp;<em>save he shall</em>&nbsp;<em>prepare a way for them</em>&nbsp;that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them."&nbsp;<sup>[25]</sup>&nbsp; If we buy into the oversimplified version of Nephi's statement and we have been commanded to climb the wall of Jerusalem, we might stand in front of the wall, jumping repeatedly in desperation, telling ourselves, "I know I can jump over this wall because the Lord commanded me to."&nbsp; On the other hand, I can imagine Nephi jumping a time or two and then stopping and thinking to himself, "The Lord would not have commanded me to do this unless He had&nbsp;<em>prepared a way</em>&nbsp;for me to do it.&nbsp; I bet there's a ladder lying around here somewhere."&nbsp; When we recognize that the Lord puts preparatory resources in place to help us fulfill the missions He assigns us, we look for and harness those resources rather than trying to do everything by ourselves.&nbsp;<br /><br />I experienced this myself several months ago when I lost my favorite set of scriptures.&nbsp; I'd just spent the last year or two marking this set of scriptures, so I was distraught.&nbsp; Each day I prayed earnestly that the Lord would help me find these scriptures, but to no avail.&nbsp; I soon became frustrated--not with the Lord, but with myself.&nbsp; Surely the Lord knew where my scriptures were, and they couldn't be far.&nbsp; Why was I so spiritually dense that I couldn't learn where they were?&nbsp; But after about three weeks, one morning I felt prompted to change my prayer.&nbsp; Instead of praying that&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;would find my scriptures, I asked the Lord to guide someone who might be closer to my scriptures to find them.&nbsp; Sure enough, that very night I got a call from a counselor in a bishopric in our stake.&nbsp; He'd been looking for some scriptures to read between meetings, so he wandered into the clerk's office, where he found my scriptures.&nbsp;<br /><br />That simple experience has changed the way I pray.&nbsp; Recently I had a major presentation to deliver, and I was rehearsing it to a committee.&nbsp; My natural-man approach would normally be to pray that the presentation would go well, with the hope that I wouldn't have to change it much.&nbsp; But this time rather than pray that my dry run would go well, I prayed for the people on the committee that they would be inspired to help me make it better.&nbsp; And they did.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, the Lord does not expect us to accomplish His work alone.&nbsp; He has put resources in place in the form of people, programs and tools that we will need to fulfill the commands He has given us.&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe this principle applies to sin and temptation as well.&nbsp; We often quote only this part of 1 Corinthians 13:10:&nbsp; "God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able . . . ."&nbsp; But the rest of the verse is quite relevant:&nbsp; "but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it." &nbsp;If we assume we can beat back any temptation all by ourselves, like the person jumping in futility before the wall of Jerusalem, we will find ourselves among those who, to use the words of Elder David A. Bednar, insist on trying to become saints "all by ourselves, through sheer grit, willpower, and discipline, and with our obviously limited capacities."&nbsp;<sup>[26]</sup>&nbsp; But what Paul actually promised us is that no matter how severe our temptations, the Lord always prepares a way for us to escape them.&nbsp; Part of wisely resisting and overcoming temptations, then, is asking the Lord what resources He has put in place to help us overcome them.&nbsp; If we foolishly think we must overcome sin all by ourselves, we may never look to the bishop, to wise counselors, to parents, and even to inspired programs the Lord has prepared to help us overcome our sinful habits.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course, as helpful as those resources are, they are nothing compared to the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the ultimate help put in place so that we can overcome sin and accomplish the Lord's work. &nbsp;The Savior Himself testified unequivocally to His apostles, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."&nbsp;<sup>[27]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ultimate Way of escape from death and sin, the Savior was, indeed, "prepared from before the foundation of the world."&nbsp;<sup>[28]</sup>&nbsp; We may jump before the insurmountable walls of our temptations until we are blue in the face, but until we turn to the ultimate resource the Lord has prepared for us all--the Atonement of Jesus Christ--we will never perform the greatest work we have all been assigned of putting off the natural man and becoming saints.&nbsp;<sup>[29]</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">Conclusion<br /></strong>Now, even as I call your attention to ways in which the Lord in His foreknowledge prepares us for opportunities and trials that lie ahead, I wish to be clear that I am not suggesting our course in life has been predestined by God.&nbsp; Foreordination guarantees only opportunities, not outcomes. &nbsp;What we do with our preparatory opportunities is entirely up to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Mordecai said to his niece, Esther, might be said to all of us in relation to some task at some time in our lives, "Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"&nbsp; But earlier in that same verse--Esther 4:14--Mordecai also made clear that the Lord would redeem Israel, whether through Esther or through someone else.&nbsp;<br /><br />The question is not whether the Lord will find a way to accomplish His work.&nbsp; He will.&nbsp; The question is whether you and I will be prepared to play our part in that work.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, I testify that the Lord not only blesses us with preparatory opportunities in our lives, but if we desire to be the means of doing much good in this generation, He will bless us to play these same preparatory roles in the lives of others.&nbsp; Understanding this can change the way we view our next chance to sit next to a stranger on the plane or on the bus.&nbsp; It can change the way we approach our next home teaching or visiting teaching visit.&nbsp; It can change the way we approach our callings, our roommates, and our co-workers.&nbsp; It can change the way we approach life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />May we recognize more clearly the individuals, opportunities, and afflictions the Lord has placed in our lives so that we may better play our part, in fulfilling his work, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
<p>President Russell M. Nelson was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 7, 1984. He was set apart as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles by President Thomas S. Monson on July 15, 2015.<br /><br />An internationally renowned surgeon and medical researcher, President &nbsp;Nelson received his BA and MD degrees from the University of Utah (1945, 1947). He is a member of honorary scholastic societies Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Alpha. He served his residency in surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and at the University of Minnesota, where he was awarded his PhD degree in 1954. He also received honorary degrees of doctor of science from Brigham Young University in 1970, doctor of medical science from Utah State University in 1989, and doctor of humane letters from Snow College in 1994.<br /><br />President Nelson's professional work included the positions of research professor of surgery and director of the thoracic surgery residency at the University of Utah, as well as chairman of the Division of Thoracic Surgery at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City.<br /><br />Author of numerous chapters in medical textbooks and other publications, President Nelson lectured at and visited professionally many organizations throughout the United States and other nations prior to his call as a General Authority. A host of awards and honors have come to him, including the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Utah, the Heart of Gold Award from the American Heart Association, a citation for International Service from the American Heart Association, and the Golden Plate Award from the American Academy of Achievement. He has also been awarded honorary professorships from three universities in the People's Republic of China.<br /><br />President Nelson has served as president of the Society for Vascular Surgery, a director of the American Board of Thoracic Surgery, chairman of the Council on Cardiovascular Surgery for the American Heart Association, and president of the Utah State Medical Association.<br /><br />He is listed in&nbsp;<em>Who's Who in the World</em>,&nbsp;<em>Who's Who in America</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Who's Who in Religion</em><br /><br />President Nelson has held numerous positions of responsibility in the Church.

<p>Thank you, President Clark.&nbsp; Sister Wendy Nelson and I are grateful for the privilege of participating with you today at this devotional assembly.&nbsp; President Thomas S. Monson and his counselors, as well as my associates in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, extend our love and greetings to each of you.&nbsp; We and all members of the Board of Trustees express our gratitude to members of the faculty and the staff of this institution.&nbsp; You are dedicated and devoted leaders.&nbsp; And to the students, we express our deep affection and best wishes.&nbsp; We love you!&nbsp; The youth of this Church are part of a chosen generation.&nbsp; You have been foreordained to be leaders in the Church of God.&nbsp; We are honored to be with you.<br /><br />Tonight Wendy will speak at the Women's Meeting and I will get to listen to her message.&nbsp; The assignment for me to speak to you this afternoon has come from the First Presidency.&nbsp; If I had my preference, I would hear from each of you.&nbsp; I would like to get to know every one of you.&nbsp; I would like to learn of your faith, of your goals in life, and of your challenges.&nbsp; Not knowing how I could make that happen, I had better be obedient to my leaders and do as they have asked.&nbsp; Please accept my virtual handshake as a sign of my love for each of you.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am still thinking about your opening hymn.&nbsp; Thank you for your meaningful musical prayer:&nbsp; "As I Searched the Holy Scriptures, loving Father of mankind, may my heart be blessed with wisdom, and may knowledge fill my mind."&nbsp;<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />From my heart and mind to yours, I address you on this occasion.&nbsp; Please be true to yourself.&nbsp; Honor--yes, even demand--highest expectations from yourself.&nbsp; Pursue your education as a priority of the highest order.&nbsp; Gain all the education you can.&nbsp; With us as Latter-day Saints, education is a religious responsibility.&nbsp; "The glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;C 93:36). &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Your personal intelligence--your personal identity--is everlasting and divine (see D&amp;C 93:29). &nbsp;I believe that Thomas Jefferson must have felt that dignity and divine nature of the human spirit when he wrote, "I have sworn upon the Altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man."&nbsp;<sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seek Education<br /></strong>Your mind is precious!&nbsp; It is sacred.&nbsp; Therefore, the education of one's mind is also sacred.&nbsp; Indeed, education is a religious responsibility.&nbsp; Of course, our opportunities and abilities will vary a great deal.&nbsp; But, in the pursuit of one's education, individual desire is more important than is the institution you choose; personal drive is more significant than is the faculty.</p>
<p>Our Creator expects His children everywhere to gain an education as a personal endeavor. &nbsp;He issued this commandment: "<em>Seek</em>&nbsp;ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea,&nbsp;<em>seek</em>&nbsp;ye out of the best books words of wisdom;&nbsp;<em>seek</em>&nbsp;learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;C 88:118; emphasis added). &nbsp;When you leave this frail existence, your material possessions will remain here, but the Lord has declared that the knowledge you acquire here will rise with you in the resurrection (see D&amp;C 130:18-19).&nbsp; In light of this celestial perspective, if you impulsively drop out or otherwise cut short your education, you would not only disregard a divine decree but also abbreviate your own eternal potential.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each one of you may have had or will yet have your own day of personal commitment--your own scholastic Sacred Grove equivalent.&nbsp; I still remember my moment of resolution. &nbsp;Many years ago, as an untrained teenager, I secured temporary employment at Christmastime.&nbsp; The work was dull, repetitive, and monotonous.&nbsp; Each hour of the day passed slowly.&nbsp; I resolved then and there that I would obtain an education that would qualify me for more meaningful work in my life.&nbsp; I determined that I would become a doctor of medicine.&nbsp;<br /><br />Many years later, when I was serving both as a medical doctor and a stake president, I chatted with many young people about their personal educational pursuits.&nbsp; Some asked me how long it took to become a doctor of medicine.&nbsp; I replied, "The general pattern would be four years at a university, followed by four years in medical school.&nbsp; And, should you choose to specialize, that could add another five years or more.&nbsp;<br /><br />My words would often evoke a response like, "You mean . . . ?&nbsp; Why, that adds up to 13 years--and maybe&nbsp;<em>more</em>?<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>That's too long for me!"&nbsp;<br /><br />"That all depends," I would respond.&nbsp; "Preparation for your career is not too long if you know what you want to do with your life.&nbsp; How old will you be 13 years from now if you&nbsp;<em>don't&nbsp;</em>pursue your education? &nbsp;Just as old, whether or not you become what you want to be!"&nbsp;<br /><br />So my counsel then--and now--is to continue your education, wherever you are, whatever your interest and opportunity may be.&nbsp; Determine how you can best serve your family and society and prepare well.&nbsp;<br /><br />Regardless of your personal choice of career, your education is the key.&nbsp; In the process, try to gain wisdom too.&nbsp; Long ago, an important question was asked by Job: "Where shall wisdom be found?" (Job 28:12) &nbsp;Just for a moment, let us focus on his profound question.&nbsp;<br /><br />Education is a vital component of wisdom.&nbsp; Not long after the pioneers began the construction of their magnificent temple in Illinois, they established the University of the City of Nauvoo.&nbsp; The First Presidency then proclaimed that this university "will enable us to teach our children wisdom, to instruct them in all the knowledge and learning, in the arts, sciences, and learned professions."&nbsp;<sup>[3]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />They listed wisdom as a priority and ranked it even before knowledge and learning.&nbsp; Less than three years after the pioneers entered the valley of the Great Salt Lake, they inaugurated the University of the State of Deseret on February 28, 1850.&nbsp;<sup>[4]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, several academies of learning were established with the hope that&nbsp;<em>wisdom</em>&nbsp;could be instilled among their youth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">Beware of Unbalance&nbsp;<br /></strong>While you search for education and wisdom, I need to offer a serious word of caution.&nbsp; Choose carefully what you will learn, whose teachings you will follow, and whose purposes you will serve.&nbsp; And don't place all of your intellectual eggs in the solitary basket of secular learning.&nbsp; Remember this warning from the Book of Mormon:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"O<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! &nbsp;When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not.&nbsp; And they shall perish.&nbsp;"But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:28-29).</p>
<p>That scriptural counsel was not heeded by a rich friend of mine who once proudly boasted that his climb toward wealth had come from tireless work and lessons learned in the "school of hard knocks." &nbsp;But his financial fortune had come at the expense of his spiritual development.&nbsp; Only when it was too late did he discover, to his regret, that his ladder of success had been leaning against the wrong wall.&nbsp; He had never heeded the following instruction from his Maker:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich.&nbsp; Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich" (D&amp;C 6:7; see also 11:7).&nbsp;<br /><br />In retrospect, I can now see that mankind's general and pervasive lack of knowledge of the scriptures has handicapped great numbers of people for long periods of time.&nbsp; The suffering that has resulted from such ignorance is truly tragic.&nbsp; I will illustrate that point with excerpts from history that pertain to the spread of infection from one person to another.&nbsp;<sup>[5]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Back in the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, very little was known about the transmission of infectious disease.&nbsp; Health officials and others ascribed infection simply to "air pollution."&nbsp; They were not concerned about pollution of the air by the visible, smoggy, hydrocarbons of today, but by what they called an invisible&nbsp;<em>miasma.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;That&nbsp;<em>miasma&nbsp;</em>was blamed for almost every infection.&nbsp; In 1867, for example, the famous surgeon, Lord Joseph Lister, indicted bad air as the chief cause of infection.&nbsp; Because of that notion, in 1869, Dr. J. Y. Simpson of Edinburgh urged a policy that hospitals be taken down and rebuilt every few years.<sup>&nbsp;[6]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a costly practice was also advocated by other experts.&nbsp;<sup>[7]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Even Florence Nightingale, a living legend following her heroic efforts in the Crimean War, was unaware of the transmission of infection from one patient to another--this despite her careful notations that wound infection accounted for 40 percent of postoperative mortality.&nbsp;<sup>[8]</sup>&nbsp; Many others missed the connection, too.&nbsp; For centuries, innumerable mothers and babies died from "childbirth fever"--serious infections unknowingly transmitted among innocent people by the unwashed hands of attendants.&nbsp;<sup>[9]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />It was only in the latter part of the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Century that the great health heroes Robert Koch, Louis Pasteur, and others proved that infection could be caused by bacteria.&nbsp; Infectious organisms in contaminated body fluids were transmitted from one individual to another by attendants who had not washed their hands.&nbsp;<br /><br />With these painful recollections of history in mind, may I quote the word of the Lord, as recorded long ago in the Old Testament's book of &nbsp;Leviticus, chapter 15:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,<br />"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue [or as we would say, pus draining] out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.<br />"And this shall be his uncleanness&nbsp;<em>in his issue . . . .<br /></em>"Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.<br />"And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water . . . .&nbsp;<br />"And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water" (Leviticus 15:1-7; emphasis added).<br />Several verses follow that reemphasize those important instructions.&nbsp; Then we read this conclusion:<br />"And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall . . . wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean" (v. 13).</p>
<p>Thus, our loving Heavenly Father clearly revealed, and His prophet faithfully recorded, the principles of clean technique in the handling of infected patients more than 3,000 years ago!&nbsp;<br /><br />These scriptures are in complete harmony with modern medical guidelines.&nbsp;<sup>[10]</sup>&nbsp; But during those many millennia, how many mothers needlessly perished? &nbsp;How many children suffered because man's quest for knowledge had failed to incorporate the word of the Lord in that quest?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">Contemporary Challenges<br /></strong><strong></strong>In our day, many challenges face us.&nbsp; Some are new, some are old--simply clothed in modern attire.&nbsp; The epistles of Paul include prophecies pertaining to our day.&nbsp; Do these descriptions sound familiar?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In the last days perilous times shall come.<br />"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, [and the list of insidious qualities goes on] . . .<br />"Without natural affection, .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .<br />"Lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; . . .<br />"Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Timothy 3:1-7).</p>
<p>Paul's warnings describe these and other dangers of our day.&nbsp; You and I know that many of these threats to happiness are wrong because they are contrary to God's will.&nbsp; Yet they are championed by persuasive people possessing more ability than morality, more knowledge than wisdom.&nbsp; Their convenient rationalization provides self-consoling justification.&nbsp; But the Bible warns us that "the way of a fool is right in his own eyes" (Proverbs 12:15). &nbsp;Indeed, individuals with ignorance of doctrine, or people with malignity of purpose, often wear the mask of honesty.&nbsp; So we must constantly be on guard.&nbsp;<br /><br />Presently, many influential people attribute problems of our day to overpopulation.&nbsp; That concept of overpopulation has become broadly believed, and efforts have been made to control birthrates--with regrettable results.&nbsp; For any society to survive, its birth rate must average at least 2.16 births per woman.&nbsp; In the past 50 years, the birthrate has dropped in nearly every nation of the world.&nbsp; In the nations of Europe, the birthrate has dropped from the replacement rate of 2.16 children per woman to the present rate of 1.45.&nbsp;<sup>[11]</sup>&nbsp; Data from the United States show similar worrisome trends.&nbsp; In 1960, minor children constituted half of the population; now they are only 30 percent.&nbsp;<sup>[12]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Predictions are that by the year 2025, single-person households in the United States will outnumber families with children.&nbsp;<sup>[13]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Lord's command to "be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it" (see Genesis 1:28; 9:1; Moses 2:28; Abraham 4:28) has never been rescinded.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, let me ask you a question.&nbsp; Is the world truly overpopulated?&nbsp; Consider the facts.&nbsp; The latest data indicate that the world's population is 6.8 billion people.&nbsp; If every one of those 6.8 billion people were allocated one quarter of an acre (for example, under that formula a family with a father and a mother with two children would be given one acre), I repeat, if a quarter of an acre were allocated to each man, woman, and child now living on the earth today, they would all fit in the country of Brazil, with 20 percent of Brazil still left unoccupied!&nbsp;<br /><br />So the real question is, do we have faith in the word of the Lord?&nbsp; He said, "For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare" (D&amp;C 104:17).&nbsp; God's work and His glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man, and He has provided this earthly opportunity for us to prepare for that glorious goal.&nbsp;<br /><br />My young brothers and sisters, to build a house straight and strong, you do not choose crooked boards.&nbsp; So to build your eternal destiny, you cannot--you must not--limit your lessons only to those lessons that are warped by the world to exclude the truth from God.&nbsp; The Book of Mormon underlines this note of caution and hope:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand.&nbsp; For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works" (Jacob 4:10).&nbsp;<br /><br />Avoidable deaths and mounting financial burdens are also being incurred worldwide because of indifference to or ignorance of God's declaration that tobacco "is not good for man" (D&amp;C 89:8). &nbsp;Many other societal problems could be listed, such as alcohol and drug abuse, gambling, pornography, immorality, infidelity, and erosion of family stability. &nbsp;We may know much, and still remain unwise. &nbsp;Where is the knowledge we have lost in obtaining information?&nbsp; And where is the wisdom we have lost in gaining knowledge?&nbsp;<sup>[14]</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">Wisdom Found<br /></strong>Wisdom is to be found in pure intelligence--in that divine light of the gospel which can guide people in all countries, all climes, and all continents.&nbsp; The Lord has promised that "a light shall break forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel" (D&amp;C 45:28). &nbsp;Then the Lord lamented:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But they receive it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their hearts from me because of the precepts of men. . . .<br />"And there shall be men standing in that generation, that shall not pass until they shall see an overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness shall cover the land.<br />"But my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved; but among the wicked, men shall lift up their voices and curse God and die.<br />"And there shall be earthquakes also in divers places, and many desolations; yet men will harden their hearts against me" (D&amp;C<strong></strong>45:29-33; see also 87:6).</p>
<p>In contrast to the darkness of such bitter chaos, the bright light of the gospel of Jesus Christ beams as the hope of the world.&nbsp; Missionaries and members courageously proclaim its brilliance.&nbsp; Wise students throughout the world heed its light and enrich their education by adding the curriculum of Church seminaries and institutes.&nbsp; The Lord hides His wisdom from no one.&nbsp; His disciple, James, wrote, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally" (James 1:5).&nbsp;<br /><br />Again we consider the question once asked by Job: "Where shall wisdom be found?" (Job 28:12.) &nbsp;The answer: it emanates from the Lord.&nbsp; He declared, "I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more" (2 Nephi 28:30).&nbsp;<br /><br />Divine light and wisdom continue to increase when love for Deity grows: "That which is of God is light, and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (D&amp;C 50:24; see also 88:67).&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the Lord's promise to you and to me: "He that keepeth [God's] commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things" (D&amp;C 93:28).&nbsp;<br /><br />Where is wisdom? &nbsp;It pulses and surges in the Lord's light of truth! &nbsp;With that light, He lifts us toward His glorious goal of eternal life, when we may dwell with Him forever.&nbsp;<br /><br />Be we again reminded that in our opening hymn we prayed for wisdom and knowledge.&nbsp; Each of us sang, "As I Searched the Holy Scriptures, loving Father of mankind, may my heart be blessed with wisdom, and may knowledge fill my mind."&nbsp; These blessings granted will provide undergirding and everlasting hope in our hearts.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know that God lives.&nbsp; Jesus is the Christ.&nbsp; This is His Church.&nbsp; We are His disciples.&nbsp; I leave my testimony, love and blessing with you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love Devotional! I try to be here each Tuesday, in fact I sit right back there in the bleachers each week. I can honestly say you look much better from that vantage point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several years ago after the first time that we had met in the Conference Center in April of 2000, President Hinkley spoke of the beautiful walnut pulpit that had been built from a tree he had planted 36 years earlier. He said he was grateful to have a small touch of himself in that great hall where the voice of prophets would go out to all the world, he was sentimental as he did so, and it made you pay attention to the beautiful pulpit and more importantly the wonderful council that would be given from it. A short time later a dear friend of mine was in the Salt Lake area and wanted to see the Conference Center. He and his wife parked the car out front and there was no one around so they went up to the door and found that it was open so they went in. They walked up front and went up on the stand. My friend stood behind the wonderful walnut pulpit that President Hinkley had spoken so passionately about. He stood behind it and ran his hands reverently over the wood work, he felt the power of that wonderful place, and looked out over a vast unseen congregation. As he stood there lost in his thoughts and the reverie of the moment, a security guard came in and saw them there. He ran up the aisle to where they stood and loudly proclaimed, &ldquo;Hey you! You don&rsquo;t belong here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dreams the last few weeks have been much like my friends experience. I am standing here at this wonderful pulpit and look out into the eyes of a vast seen congregation of young people, and up the aisle I see Brother Garth Gunderson from security , run up and announce in front of everyone, &ldquo;Hey you! You don&rsquo;t belong here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what I have chosen to speak to you today about, standing in Holy places, regardless of what the world around you might say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that introduction I would like to ask you a question. Have any of you ever had a bad day? Raise your hand if you think you have had a bad day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of years ago my brother called me and as we visited, I asked him that same question, he said he had had better days. He then asked me how my day was and I told him that I no longer had bad days; of course he wanted an explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That day some unusual things happened. I was at work trying to keep pace with a busy schedule. I had just finished my morning surgeries and hurried to exam room one to see my first patient, in our practice there is a small slot in the door that holds the medical records where the technicians write their findings&nbsp; as they interview clients and examine the patient. Today the card was empty. That was strange and as that fact was beginning to register, something else out of the ordinary happened. The door softly closed behind me, and the technician who normally followed me into the room was on the other side of it. There was a scruffy white and black dog sitting on the exam table, you have never seen such an emaciated mess in all your life. He had one red swollen eye and what looked to be a large dirt clod on his head. His coat was dirty and unkempt and he was very gaunt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having no idea what we were doing, and learning only that the dogs name was Cholo from the record, I asked, &ldquo;What are we doing for Cholo today?&rdquo; For a moment no one answered, there appeared to be a whole family there, grandparents a mother and father and several kids, and they all looked at the floor. They were Hispanic and as is often the case an older woman touched a young girl on the shoulder and she began to speak. &ldquo;We had Cholo put to sleep a week ago.&rdquo; With that flat statement my gut tightened slightly, I could envision that we had put Cholo to sleep a week ago and that somehow we had not done a very good job, and he had come back to life, you know that can be considered as one of the ultimate failures. That is a hard decision for people to make and if it had gone poorly, I could imagine that they were not happy, so tentatively, I asked, &ldquo;Did we put him to sleep?&rdquo; They smiled and the little girl said &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Now relieved but still confused I prompted them to continue. This time the mother in broken English began to explain. &ldquo;A week ago Cholo ran into the road and was hit by a car, it didn&rsquo;t kill him but he was badly hurt.&rdquo; &ldquo;His eyeball was popped out and his skull was fractured, we could see his brain!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We knew he could not live and so my husband&rsquo;s friend took him into the desert and put him to sleep.&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;How did he put him to sleep?&rdquo; She answered that he had shot him five times. I laughed and commented, &ldquo;He must not have been a very good shot.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh no&rdquo;, came the reply, &ldquo;Cholo was dead, and we buried him in a shallow grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was becoming more bizarre by the moment. Still perplexed, I ask, &ldquo;How did he get home.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;An hour ago the phone rang and my husband&rsquo;s boss said your dog is out here and he doesn&rsquo;t look very good, you better come and get him. We tried to explain that it could not be our dog that he had been dead for a week, but he said he was sure it was our dog and that we had better come down. It was Cholo and so here we are.&rdquo; Still not sure what they wanted, I ask, &ldquo;What do you want us to do, put him to sleep?&rdquo; The mother became excited and began to shake her head, &ldquo;No, no, Cholo is a good dog, after all of this, he came home to us. We want you to fix him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cholo had had a bad day. He set a new standard for bad days. He had been hit by a car, had his skull fractured, his eyeball popped out of its socket. He had been taken out into the desert away from his family and shot five times. Then to end this bad day, he was buried alive. So with this as our standard, I would submit that I have never had a bad day and neither have most of you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These were poor people so I began to explain that we would want to take x-rays and run some tests to see what would be best for Cholo. The mother looked at her hands and said &ldquo;We only have $1200.00.&rdquo; I am sure this was all the money they had in the world. I told them to have a seat and we would see how extensive his injuries were and then we could talk of the costs involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really expected to find very little when we x-rayed Cholo, but when the pictures were developed, he had been shot five times in the head and neck. I don&rsquo;t know how he was alive, but he was. The dirt clod on the head turned out to be a large laceration and a fracture into his frontal sinus. What they thought was the brain was actually the sinus cavity. We cleaned it up and sutured his wounds. The eye was very red and hemorrhagic; it had been proptosed and because of the loss of blood it had sunk back in to the socket and his vision was fine, even though the eye was very blood shot. Cholo required very little attention, a few sutures and some antibiotics and pain killers. He was a modern day miracle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you may think that these folks must have been cruel monsters to have put their friend through so much. But if you examine what they did, they were trying to help, not hurt. They knew that Cholo was hurt and that he was suffering, so they sought to alleviate that suffering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life is like that. Many times well meaning people try to help make things better, but inadvertently they make things worse. Something is said, offense is taken or help is offered and injury occurs. Once the hurt happens, then it falls to us to decide what we will do with it. Pres. Faust gave us this council.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of us need time to work through pain and loss. We can find all manner of reasons for postponing forgiveness. One of these reasons is waiting for the wrongdoers to repent before we forgive them. Yet such a delay causes us to forfeit the peace and happiness that could be ours. The folly of rehashing long-past hurts does not bring happiness.&rdquo; (President James E. Faust, &ldquo;The Healing Power of Forgiveness,&rdquo; Ensign, May 2007, 67-69)</p>
<p>Many of us feel that one day is much the same as the next. We allow with that feeling a sense of monotony and of the mundane. Sometimes we even believe that we have had a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; day. Yet if we look at the scriptures, the Lord feels just the opposite, as He uses phrases like, &ldquo;upon this day&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the day of the Lord&rdquo;, &ldquo;there cometh a day upon which&hellip;&rdquo; Over a thousand of these types of statements leads me to believe that the Lord accounts each day as special and as an opportunity to teach and lift us closer to Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 9/11 President Hinkley gathered us together and gave us this sage advice from the scriptures, &ldquo;When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place&rdquo; (Matthew 24:15) <strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>So when hard things come, desolating things, we have been told to stand fast in the holy place. I view this as a holy place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We think of holy places such as the church or our homes, and especially the temple, but a holy place is any where the Lord would place us. And if with our agency, we choose, we then are standing in the holy place the lord is talking about. Now I am not suggesting that we not be vigilant in our homes or in our church responsibilities, or that regular temple attendance is not a vital part of what we do and who we are. Quite the contrary, the scriptures teach us of the weightier matters of the law:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.&rdquo; (Matthew 23:23) &nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, these things are expected of us to do, and in the doing, we will be able to draw on the enabling power of the atonement that will allow us to stand when the abomination of desolation is manifest in our own lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We learn a lot from this unusual day that Cholo had. The people that meant to help, made things worse. But in the end they were willing to give all that they had to make things right. They recognized that they had been the source of pain and injury, but they also recognized that they had the power to help Cholo when he allowed them to by his returning. The Savior spoke of these circumstances when he taught;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I<strong> </strong>shall <strong>heal</strong> them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.&rdquo; &nbsp;(3 Nephi 18:32)</p>
<p>We have the power to help those who have lost their way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, Cholo, when he came to himself, the first thing he did was to come back home. Most of us are that way, or should be. Think of the prodigal son, after his inheritance was squandered,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father&rsquo;s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father&rdquo; (Luke 15: 17-18)</p>
<p>We want to go home, but oft times, pride gets in the way, we suffer until we become sufficiently humble to approach those we wish to be with. This happens in the church. Those whose testimonies of the truth are fragile have some well meaning person who may be trying to help them, but inadvertently cause some offense and they feel injured so they stay away, not realizing that they want to be healed. Christ illustrated this as he appeared to the ancient Nephites after rampant destruction and upheaval in the land, the people must have been reeling from injury and loss, as Christ was able to speak to them and have them understand he taught them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than they, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?&rdquo;&nbsp;(3 Nephi 9:13)</p>
<p>We all want to return, and be healed, but many times we don&rsquo;t yet realize that we are not whole. As this realization comes and we begin to soften, if we are surrounded by those who love, we will respond. The key is to surround them with love. A caring visiting teacher, a diligent home teacher, their respective assignments are to love these people, even when that love is unrequited. <em>Charlie Brown</em> put it this way, &ldquo;Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love.&rdquo; I am sure some of you have had experience with this. So sometimes we are too hesitant to do our duty as it were, we are afraid of the bad taste that might come if we are rejected, but remember Cholo&rsquo;s family, they were willing to give all that they had, if need be, to help Cholo. Should we do less?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been given all that we need to be successful in these assignments that come. I remember one of these opportunities while serving in the Cannery. I was standing by a conveyor belt watching it go by with dizzying results. One of the workers came up and informed me that a women from my ward had passed out and would I please go and check on her. When I arrived, they were loading her in an ambulance to take her to the hospital. They said she had been out for about thirty minutes. I asked if she had been given a blessing, they said no, but there was a Catholic Priest who had come with a friend, and that he had given her the last rites, but that no one had given her a blessing. I followed her to the hospital and with her husband, we gave her a blessing. It amazed me that with all of the faithful priesthood brethren there, no one had thought to give her a blessing. President Packer said we live far below our privileges. We need to be bolder in using the amazing spiritual gifts each of us are endowed with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can remember that when we are on the Lord&rsquo;s errand we are entitled to the Lord&rsquo;s help, it will give us confidence and the knowledge that we never stand alone, for only He was called to stand alone. We can, by our choices, choose to stand alone, but were never called or required to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, this is the promise of the Lord unto you&hellip;"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.&rdquo; (D&amp;C 68: 5-6)</p>
<p>Many of us believe that love cannot be genuine if it comes from an assignment, yet if we test it against the scriptures we are told:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. &nbsp;This is the first and great commandment. &nbsp;And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&rdquo; (Matthew 22:38-39)</p>
<p>The third thing that we learn from Cholo is to not stand in the middle of the road. Nothing good happens in the middle of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord tells us<em> </em>&ldquo;I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot<strong>: </strong>I<strong> </strong>would thou wert cold or<strong> </strong>hot.&rdquo; (Revelations 3:15)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we are given a blessing, whether in the form of a calling or an opportunity of an education or a job, we should not squander away these precious things, or as President Newdahl taught us, seed these things to someone else, referring to our agency. &nbsp;The Lord will help us: &ldquo;Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.&rdquo; (Hymns of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, &ldquo;Be Thou Humble&rdquo; 130)</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>It might be helpful for me to share a little of how I came, with my family, to stand in this holy place with you today. We lived in a small community in western Idaho; I was a partner in a successful veterinary practice. Our kids were growing and happy as they entered their last years of high school.&nbsp; As we served in our community, we established friendships and alliances. All was well. Then one day we got a seemingly innocent call from BYU&ndash;Idaho asking us to come and speak at a fireside.&nbsp; It sounded fun, a free meal and a night in a hotel.&nbsp; We accepted the invitation and spoke of the atonement.&nbsp; It was a warm and pleasant experience.&nbsp; While we were here they mentioned that they were going to hire a veterinarian and that we should apply.&nbsp; We thanked them and told them that we were happy where we were.&nbsp; We went home and with the rush of busy lives, largely forgot about the experience.&nbsp; Then came calls, careful calls, but regular, requesting just that we think about it, the hint that we pray about it. Over a two-year period, the calls continued and we began to pray and to ponder. We got no clear answer. Out of desperation, I talked to Elder Neal Andersen, he suggested that we try it and if it was what the Lord would have us do then doors would open and the path would be made clear, if not, there would be road blocks. So we moved ahead and doors did open and answers did come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day after the decision had been made, I sat pondering what all of this would mean to us, and as I was thus employed, the Holy Ghost spoke these words to my mind, &ldquo;When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.&rdquo;(Luke 22:32) These words came just as clearly and indelibly as if they had been audible. This took me back. I thought I was converted and that I was strengthening my brethren in the things that I was doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I remembered that the Lord had told Peter the same thing. It was this same Peter that when he met Jesus the first time was told, &ldquo;Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.&rdquo; (John 1:42) Translated into Greek or Latin, Cephas means Petra or Peter. At the very beginning, the Lord knew the character that Peter possessed and he spent the rest of his ministry teaching him. Peter was privileged over the next two years to witness many miracles at Jesus&rsquo; very feet. He saw many times the healing of the sick and the raising of the dead. He was there when Christ fed the multitudes with a few loaves of bread and a couple of fish. &nbsp;Christ sent him on a mission and commanded him to do these same things that he had witnessed firsthand. And yet he still lacked the conversion that Christ wished for him. When Christ declared himself to the multitudes, many became angry and left him, it must have been a sad moment for the Savior of the world, we&rsquo;re told:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that&nbsp;time&nbsp;many of his&nbsp;disciples&nbsp;went back, and&nbsp;walked&nbsp;no more with him."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?&rdquo; (John 6: 66-67)</p>
<p>That is a question that each of us need to prepare for. For when our abomination of desolation comes, will we also go away, and walk no more with him, or will we, like Cholo, come home. Peter answered the question this way,&nbsp;&ldquo;Lord, to whom shall&nbsp;we&nbsp;go? Thou hast the&nbsp;words&nbsp;of eternal life.&rdquo; (John 6:68) &nbsp;And then he added these qualifiers, almost as if to give greater credence to his declaration. &ldquo;And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the&nbsp;Son&nbsp;of the living God.&rdquo; (John 6:69)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was Peter who asked, &ldquo;Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? &nbsp;Till seven<strong> </strong>times? &nbsp;(Matthew 18: 21-22) There must have been some hurt or offence that prompted this question. Still the Savior patiently working with that impetuous Peter, like he does with each of us until we reach<em> </em>&ldquo;the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ&rdquo; (Ephesians 4:13) taught him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say not unto thee, until seven<strong> </strong>times: but, until <strong>seventy </strong>times<strong> </strong>seven.&rdquo; (Matthew 18:22)<em> </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;Forgiveness is for us, not for those who have offended us. You see it allows with the forgiveness the opportunity of always being able, like Cholo, to go home, it puts us in control. Peter was a good man, a great man, and still he did not yet possess all that Christ desired for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On another occasion,</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea, he asked his disciples, Whom<strong> </strong>do<strong> </strong>men<strong> </strong>say<strong> </strong>that<strong> </strong>I the Son of man am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they said, Some say<strong> </strong>that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saith unto them, But whom<strong> </strong>say<strong> </strong>ye<strong> </strong>that<strong> </strong>I<strong> </strong>am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jesus answered and said unto him, &ldquo;Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.&rdquo; (Matthew 16: 13-17)</p>
<p>Surely at this point, Peter had achieved the conversion that Christ desired for him. It must have gratified the Savior to see and hear the testimony that Peter bore without hesitation or the need to qualify his statement and yet there was still more for Peter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shortly before the Savior departed to the Garden of Gesthamane, he turned to Peter with great concern, fatherly concern, for him. And said, &ldquo;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.&rdquo; (Luke 22:31) It is significant that the Lord used his old name Simon and did not refer to him as the rock at this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when<strong> </strong>thou<strong> </strong>art<strong> converted</strong>, strengthen thy brethren. Peter was taken back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.&rdquo; (Luke 22:33)</p>
<p>And yet the Lord persisted<strong><em>, </em></strong>&ldquo;I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou<strong> </strong>shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.&rdquo; (Luke 22:34) Peter believed that nothing on earth could make this so, he was ready to give his life and yet the saying was true and Peter denied Christ three times in the agonizing hours that followed. &nbsp;After the last time he had denied Christ, the Savior passed near by him, and looked upon Peter, &ldquo;And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou<strong> </strong>shalt deny me thrice.&nbsp; And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.&rdquo; &nbsp;(Matthew 26:75)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His real strength had not yet come to him, and the Lord knew it. It would come but it would be born out of the silence of a long-suffering heart. You see this was Peter&rsquo;s abomination of desolation, and out of it came the giant that we think of when we remember this ancient apostle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter went about doing much good, he preached with the other apostles and on more than one occasion he was imprisoned and told never to preach in the name of Christ again, all of this done at the threat of death. They were imprisoned and set free by an angel who told them to go to the temple and preach there to the people, all the words of life. Again when it was discovered that they had escaped from prison they were taken and brought before the council, they were reminded that they were commanded not to preach in the name of Christ, to which Peter answered and testified,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to obey God rather than men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.&rdquo; (Acts 5:29-32)<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>This inflamed and infuriated the Pharisee&rsquo;s and they thought to put them to death, but for a lawyer by the name of Gamaliel. He had the apostles taken out of the room and warned the council that the people might rebel against them, that it might be better to beat them and command them again to never speak of Christ, and let them go. So they did just that. If they received a scourging, they would have been stripped to the waist and tied between two posts so they could lean forward so the lash would have been more effective. They would have been beaten many times and then released. As they were thrown bleeding back in to the street, they did not mourn, or count life unfair, but they went &ldquo;rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.&rdquo; (Acts 5:41)<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter, because he was&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;</strong>willing to<strong> </strong>submit<strong> </strong>to all things which the Lord saw fit to inflict upon him, even as a<strong> </strong>child<strong> </strong>doth<strong> </strong>submit<strong> </strong>to his<strong> </strong>father<strong>.&rdquo; </strong>(Mosiah 3:19)<em> &nbsp;</em>He became Cephas, the rock, whom Christ prophesied that he would be, he strengthened his brethren. He could testify as the Psalmist, &ldquo;This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.&rdquo; (Psalms 118:24) &nbsp;Even if it is a hard day, if we keep the commandments, we will never truly have a bad day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as I close I would change my question to you, from have you ever had a bad day? To; Who is it that Christ see&rsquo;s you to be. The scriptures tell us exactly that,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth<strong> </strong>not<strong> </strong>yet<strong> </strong>appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.&rdquo; (1 John 3:22<strong><em>)</em></strong></p>
<p>And the greatest compliment that anyone, anywhere will ever pay you came from an inspired question the Lord himself asked, &ldquo;what manner of men ought ye to be?&rdquo; And answering, the Lord reveled, &ldquo;even as I am.&rdquo; (3 Nephi 27:27)</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>This means that we have to decide, where we will stand, what kind of footprints will we leave on this path we call life, will it be where the Lord places us and asks us to trod, or will it be someplace else, my hope and prayer is that we may fit the pattern that Longfellow spoke of:</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Lives of great men all remind us<br />We can make our lives sublime,<br />And, departing, leave behind us<br />Footprints on the sands of time;<br /><br />Footprints, that perhaps another,<br />Sailing o'er life's solemn main,<br />A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,<br />Seeing, shall take heart again.<br /><br />Let us, then, be up and doing,<br />With a heart for any fate;<br />Still achieving, still pursuing,<br />Learn to labour and to wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (By&nbsp;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow; 1807-1882)</p>

<p></p>
<p>In May1337, King Philip VI of France formally announced that he was laying claim to the duchy of Aquitaine, a part of present-day France which was at the time at least nominally under the jurisdiction of Edward III, King of England.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Thus, began what is commonly known as the Hundred Years War, a conflict between England and France that lasted 116 years, and is considered by many historians to be the longest war in recorded history.&nbsp; Imagine a war that lasted more than a century.&nbsp; People would be born, grow up, marry, have their own children, and die - without ever having known what life was like without the war.&nbsp;&nbsp;And their children and often grandchildren would have the same experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;To those multiple generations that lived in France and England during that period, the war must, at times, have seemed endless.<br /><br />Despite its record length, the Hundred Years War was not the deadliest conflict in recorded human history.&nbsp; That dubious honor belongs to World War II in which, by conservative estimates, 50 million people lost their lives.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; One study concluded that the Soviet Union alone suffered more than 25 million deaths as a result of the conflict, nearly 15% of that country's population.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;To those nations most directly affected by that deadly conflict, and to those who lost even a single loved-one, the cost of the war must, at times, have seemed unbearable.&nbsp;<br /><br />As long as the Hundred Years War was and as many casualties as World War II produced, &nbsp;combined they were not as long nor as costly as another war - a war that commenced before the foundation of the world and one that has continued largely unabated since that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />That conflict began when our Father in Heaven convened his children in a grand council in heaven to discuss a plan by which we, as His children, could come to experience the kind of joyful and perfect life that He enjoyed.&nbsp; We do not know all the particulars of the dispute, but we do know that one of the core areas of disagreement concerned the concept of agency, something we already possessed at that stage of our existence.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; Agency was an indispensible part of our Father's proposed plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were to be allowed to choose freely between good and evil, so that we might develop and perfect our ability to make correct choices.&nbsp; Because we would inevitably make mistakes as we engaged in that kind of experiential learning process, a Savior would be provided for us, one who would atone for our sins - if we would repent of them - thereby allowing us in the words of Elder Bruce Hafen, to "learn from [our] experience without being condemned by it."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />But there was an alternative plan presented.&nbsp; It was presented by Lucifer, "an angel of God who was in authority."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; We don't know all the details of Lucifer's plan, but we do know that he "sought to destroy the agency of man,"<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;and made the false promise that not one soul would be lost.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp; We also know that some of our brothers and sisters found Lucifer's plan more attractive than that presented by our Heavenly Father and that a conflict - which the scriptures call a "war in heaven"<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;- ensued between the two groups.&nbsp;<br /><br />We also don't know the exact nature of the battle, or the kind of weapons that were used, but John's description in Revelations chapter 12 verse 11 tells us that those who favored the Father's plan triumphed over Lucifer and his followers "by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony." &nbsp;This strongly implies that it was a war of words and faith, rather than a physical conflict.&nbsp; That we prevailed by the "word of [our] testimony"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;also strongly suggests that we each expressed our individual faith in the Savior's promise that He would live His life and give His life in such a perfect manner that His infinite atonement would allow us to overcome the spiritual and physical deaths that were an inevitable part of the celestializing learning process we would go through in mortality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep in mind that when we made our decision at this critical juncture in our existence, the atonement had not yet happened.&nbsp; The blood of the Lamb had not yet been shed.&nbsp; We had to exercise faith in&nbsp;<strong>God's</strong>&nbsp;promise that His plan would work - and in&nbsp;<strong>Christ's&nbsp;</strong>promise that He would perform His indispensible part perfectly.&nbsp;Perhaps those who followed Lucifer found his plan so attractive precisely because they lacked faith in those divine promises - or faith in themselves to make correct choices.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In any event, those who favored the Father's plan prevailed in the conflict.&nbsp; Ironically, those who sought to eliminate agency from our experience were allowed to exercise theirs throughout the process.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp; But this allowance came at a very high price - a third part of our Father's children lost their first estate<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;and thereby precluded themselves from ever having the fullness of joy that they might have experienced.&nbsp; Think about that.&nbsp; A third of the hosts of heaven were lost.&nbsp; While it is not entirely clear that the scriptural record is to be interpreted as meaning that literally 33 1/3 percent of those present were lost,<sup>14</sup>&nbsp; if that's what it does mean - the number of casualties&nbsp; could&nbsp; have been in the tens of billions.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the numbers were less, when one considers the ultimate fate of those who kept not their first estate,<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;the loss must have been almost unbearable.&nbsp; It is no wonder that - as the scriptures record - "the heavens wept" over the loss.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The implications of the enormity and permanency of that loss are quite profound.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It demonstrates in a very powerful way the absolute centrality and indispensability of the concept of agency.&nbsp; Surely, if there were a way that the plan could have operated without the loss of so many of God's children, He would have chosen that path.&nbsp; However, agency is apparently so central to the eternal plan - such a bedrock foundation of the eternal laws that make exaltation possible - that God himself adheres to its principles, even when it means seeing some of His children condemned to failure. &nbsp;Viewed in that light, these well-known verses in Doctrine and Covenants section 121 take on a much deeper meaning:&nbsp;"No power or influence can [not just should not, but cannot] be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; By kindness, and pure knowledge."&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just practical advice on how modern mortal priesthood bearers should interact with others; it is an eternal law and truth to which God Himself adheres.&nbsp;<br /><br />Because the concept of agency is so core to God's eternal plan of happiness for His children, Satan, whose goal is to make all men and women "miserable like unto himself,"<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;continues to do all he can to destroy it.&nbsp; As President James E. Faust observed, the war that began in heaven "rages today ever more fiercely."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In order to understand the sometimes subtle, but unrelenting, ways in which Satan wages the battle in our lives today, it is helpful to understand the conditions that allow agency to exist and operate fully in our lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder D. Todd Christofferson has identified three key "elements" of what the scriptures call "moral agency."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;The first is the existence of "alternatives to choose among."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Options make agency possible.&nbsp; In the words of Lehi, "[I]t must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp; But these are not just options in the abstract (as Satan would have us believe), but options with consequences, consequences determined by eternal law.&nbsp; As Elder Christofferson explained, "Law provides us the options.&nbsp; It is by the operation of laws that things happen.&nbsp; By using or obeying a law, one can bring about a particular result - and by disobedience, the opposite result."<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The second key element, according to Elder Christofferson, is knowledge.&nbsp; "[F]or us to have agency," he noted, "we must not only have alternatives but we must also know that they exist and what they are."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the more true knowledge we have, the greater the scope of our agency, especially if the knowledge includes an understanding of the consequences of our choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The third essential element is the "freedom to make choices," - that is, the ability to act on our knowledge of the available alternatives according to our desires or will - something Elder Christofferson identifies as "agency itself."<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we may have had the capacity to express preferences as intelligences at the earliest stage of our eternal existence, our ability to act on those choices was enhanced by God's granting to us both our spiritual and physical bodies.&nbsp; By way of illustration, Elder Lionel Kendrick observed, "with our mortal bodies, we have the power of procreation in this life.&nbsp; We have the choice and capacity to control our physical desire, or have it control us."<sup>27</sup>&nbsp; We could not make such choices without the bodies that God has granted to us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of these three elements - the existence of alternatives from which to choose, knowledge of those alternatives, and the capacity to select among them and act according to our desires - are essential to the existence of agency.&nbsp; However, while these three elements are necessary for agency to exist, they are not, by themselves, sufficient without the addition of a fourth fundamental, and most important foundation of agency - the Atonement.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as President Boyd K. Packer has observed, "[h]ad agency come to man without the Atonement, it would have been a fatal gift."<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we are imperfect we will inevitably use our agency to make wrong choices, and a single wrong choice would, without the atonement, eventually result in permanent physical death - and permanent banishment from the presence of God.&nbsp; In the words of the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob,&nbsp;<strong>without an infinite atonement</strong>, "this corruption could not put on incorruption, [and] . . . this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble &nbsp;. . . to rise no more.&nbsp; . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; And our spirits must have become like unto [the devil], and we become &nbsp;. . .&nbsp; angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God ...."<sup>29</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the infinite atonement which Christ perfectly performed is, like the existence of alternatives, knowledge of those alternatives, and the ability to choose, something without which agency could not operate productively in the eternal plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Lehi summed it up well in this familiar verse from 2 Nephi chapter 2, which refers to all four of the essential elements of agency:&nbsp;<em>"And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall [the atonement]. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing [knowledge] good from evil [the existence of alternatives]; to act for themselves [the ability to act on our preferences] and not to be acted &nbsp;upon . . .&nbsp; Wherefore, [Lehi concluded]. . . all things are given ... which are expedient unto man.&nbsp; . . ."</em><sup>30</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Even though these four essential pillars of agency are in place, Satan continues to wage the battle that he started before the foundation of the world.&nbsp; Perhaps it is arrogance, perhaps it is disbelief that God can, or will, fulfill all His promises, or perhaps it is simply outright defiance.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, Satan refuses to believe he has lost the war, and he continues to seek to destroy the agency of man, doing all he can to promote conduct and belief that will limit our agency.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he does it in ways that can confuse us so that we don't recognize that our essential agency is under attack.&nbsp; He does not tempt us by simply saying, "do this and your agency will be taken away."&nbsp; Instead, he attempts to disguise his modern-day efforts to destroy our agency by subtly undermining each of the four foundations of agency; often camouflaging his arguments in the name of freedom itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, Satan can undermine our ability to choose - one of the essential elements of agency - by enticing us to engage in conduct that can eventually - and in some cases, quickly - become addictive.&nbsp; Alcohol, drugs, and pornography are well known examples of this phenomenon.&nbsp; Satan does not tempt us with these enslaving activities by pointing out that our agency will be limited if we engage in them, but rather by trying to convince us that such activities will make us free and by arguing that admonitions to avoid such evils are themselves a violation of our agency.&nbsp; He would have us confuse the initial decision to act, which is entirely within our control, with the ability to decide the consequences of our actions, which is governed by eternal law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Elder Dallin Oaks taught this principle using an example to which I believe you can readily relate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"When I was serving [as President] of BYU,"&nbsp;</em>Elder Oaks said<em>,&nbsp; "I heard many arguments on BYUs' Honor Code or dress and grooming standards that went like this:&nbsp; 'It is wrong for BYU to take away my free agency by forcing me to keep certain rules in order to be admitted or permitted to continue as a student.' [BYU did not force you to come here . . . That was your choice] ...&nbsp; It will not do to pretend that our agency has been taken away when we are not free to exercise it without unwelcome consequences."</em>&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Satan is correct when he tells us that we can use our agency to choose to engage in potentially addictive behavior, but he consciously fails to point out that we cannot avoid the consequences of those choices, which in many instances will greatly limit future choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is not just by enticing us to engage in clearly addictive behavior that Satan tries to limit our ability to act according to our desires.&nbsp; He is able to limit this core component of agency by confusing us in other ways.&nbsp; Let me illustrate with a simple example from my own life.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, I practiced law in Arizona.&nbsp; The morning commute from our home in Tempe to my office in downtown Phoenix was a daily adventure that took anywhere from 20 minutes, on a good day, to close to an hour, on a bad day.&nbsp; After a few months, I began to notice that my mood for the day was determined largely by how long the commute took and how aggravated I was with the drivers who I thought were causing the problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; The longer the commute, and the more annoying the drivers, the more irritable I was with everyone I met during the day.&nbsp; When I first noticed this trend (probably long after my co-workers had discovered it), I became even more annoyed at the other drivers.&nbsp; How dare they ruin my day by making me angry and frustrated?&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one day I read, not for the first time, but with new eyes, three verses from Lehi's teachings in Second Nephi chapter 2.&nbsp; The first is verse 14:&nbsp;<em>"God ... hath created .. all things that [are in the heavens and earth], both things to act and things to be acted upon."&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;"That's it," I thought, "my problem is that those other drivers are acting upon me.&nbsp; It's all their fault."&nbsp; Then I came to verses 26 and 27:&nbsp;<em>"And the Messiah cometh in the fullness of time that he may redeem the children of men ...&nbsp;<strong>And because that they are redeemed from the fall, they have become free forever ... to act for themselves and not to be acted upon</strong>. ... Wherefore men are free ... to choose liberty and eternal life ... or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself."</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It hit me like a thunderbolt.&nbsp; The problem was not with the other drivers; the problem was with me.&nbsp; Because of the atonement, I was free to choose my attitude, to act for myself, but I was surrendering that freedom by succumbing to Satan's temptation to become angry.&nbsp; And - just as Satan desired - I was becoming miserable.&nbsp; He had me thinking I had no choice about what mood I was in, when in reality, because of the atonement, it was entirely my choice.&nbsp; I could choose to act, but I too often chose to be acted upon, to be led captive by the actions of others, thereby surrendering my agency to them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Any time Satan can get us to sin - even when the sin does not obviously lead to addiction -&nbsp; he thereby limits our agency - at least until we repent.&nbsp; As the Bible Dictionary explains,&nbsp;<em>"By transgression, man loses control over his own will and becomes the slave of sin."&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;</em>In some cases, such as with pornography or drugs, this is obvious.&nbsp; Yet even less dramatic sins like anger, procrastination, or the use of improper language can cause us to lose our agency.&nbsp; We should not so easily give away in this estate that for which we fought so valiantly in the prior one.&nbsp;<br /><br />Just as he uses clever deception to persuade us unknowingly to limit our capacity to choose, Satan also tries subtly to eliminate the knowledge element of the agency equation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have already referred to one way in which he does this - by trying to convince us that knowledge of what the initial choices are is full knowledge, when such knowledge is woefully incomplete without a corresponding knowledge of the consequences of our actions.&nbsp; A related method that Satan uses to limit the knowledge component of our agency is to cause us to undervalue the knowledge that is available to us.&nbsp; While it is true that some kinds of information are more important than others to our eternal progression, it is also true that acquisition of true knowledge in&nbsp;<strong>any field</strong>&nbsp;can enhance the scope of our agency.&nbsp; As Russell T. Osguthorpe, the Sunday School General President, explained in a recent devotional at LDS Business College:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Every time we learn more truth in whatever field of study, our choices expand.&nbsp; The nurse who learns about the effects of the drug atropine can choose to administer that drug to a patient whose heartbeat is fading.&nbsp; The nurse who does not know about the effects of atropine cannot make that choice, and the patient might die.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;</em>[Brother Osguthorpe continues]<em>&nbsp;our ability to exercise that power that is within us to choose increases as we learn.&nbsp; The more we choose to learn, the more power we have to choose."</em>&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp; Thus, what you learn here will not just help you pass a class or acquire the skills you need to support yourself financially, it can expand the scope of your eternal agency.&nbsp; Don't let Satan fool you into thinking that knowledge is transitory or unimportant.&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan also uses clever and misleading arguments to undermine another key element of agency - the existence of alternatives or opposites from which to choose.&nbsp; One way in which he does this is by making critical distinctions between opposites seem insignificant, thereby obscuring the true nature of the alternatives.&nbsp; For example, he seeks to convince us that the only difference between a violation of the law of chastity and the proper use of the sacred powers of procreation is a piece of paper, suggesting that a marriage license is the sole distinction between these two dramatically different acts, and thereby causing some to misunderstand both the purpose of the procreative powers and the eternal significance of sacred temple covenants.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This blurring of distinctions causes some to fail to realize the true significance of the choices they face concerning intimate relationships, thus leading them to make choices that can limit their agency eternally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Understanding the centrality of agency can change the way you view almost every experience you have, even your experience as students at BYU Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give one example.&nbsp; As you may have noticed, the tuition you - and students at all BYU campuses and LDS Business College - pay is considerably lower than that charged by almost any other private university.&nbsp; You may also be aware that your tuition does not come close to paying the cost of your education and that your education - like that of all students at all BYU campuses - is heavily subsidized by the tithe payers of the Church.&nbsp; With this fact in mind, when I became the dean of the law school at BYU, I suggested to the University Administration that it might be proper to increase the law school's tuition.&nbsp; I questioned the fairness of using what in some cases is the widow's mite to finance the education of lawyers, many of whom will have generous incomes over their careers.&nbsp; (I should also acknowledge that I thought the law school's revenues might be helped by such an increase - so my motives weren't entirely pure).&nbsp; &nbsp;In any event, my suggestion that tuition be increased was not accepted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That caused me to wonder why the Board of Trustees, which includes the members of the First Presidency, three members of the Quorum of the Twelve, and other people who know well the many good uses to which tithing funds could be put - would choose to so heavily subsidize the education of lawyers - and that of all other BYU students.&nbsp; As I pondered that question, the thought came powerfully to my mind that one possible reason has to do with the concept of agency.&nbsp; Using tithing to subsidize BYU students' education allows those students to graduate with much less debt than they might otherwise have - in many cases with no debt at all.&nbsp; By contrast, the average law student at many top private law schools graduates with a law school-incurred debt of more than $100,000.&nbsp; With such debt hanging over their heads, the choice of what those students can do following graduation is severely limited.&nbsp; They have little choice but to work for the highest paying firm they can find, because, as I told prospective law students, they will have a mortgage payment, they just won't have a house to go with it.&nbsp; As many of our leaders have reminded us, "debt can be enslaving."<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;It can limit our agency dramatically.&nbsp; Some law students might decide that they could be of most use as a solo practitioner in Driggs, Idaho or Panguitch, Utah, but if they have to pay off a large educational debt with what they earn, that avenue may not be open to them.&nbsp; Other law students may decide that rather than practice law, they will stay home with young children.&nbsp; However, if they are tens of thousands of dollars in debt, such a choice may be impracticable.&nbsp; Thus, the sacrifice of millions of tithe payers who subsidize your education leaves you free to choose to do what you - and the Lord - want you to do.&nbsp;<br /><br />With that freedom, as with all freedom, comes accountability.&nbsp; In the case of BYU students, whether they be in Provo, Laie, or Rexburg there are at least two important parts of that accountability.&nbsp; First, it is incumbent on you - whose career and life options are being expanded as a result of the sacrifice of others &nbsp;- to maximize the educational opportunity that is afforded to you.&nbsp; It is your responsibility to learn all you can, so that you are best positioned to do what you - and the Lord - want you to do. &nbsp;Contrary to what Satan may whisper in your ear when the alarm goes off early in the morning to rouse you to go to class or finish a paper, there is more riding on the decision you make at that point than your own g.p.a. or individual success.&nbsp; Those who could benefit from your enhanced education - whether they be your future children, your future clients, or the communities or nations in which you will live &nbsp;- all will be benefitted by your choosing to use your time here as wisely as possible.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second, because the subsidy allows you to be relatively free from debt and therefore free to do what the Lord wants you to do, it is your responsibility to live your life in a way that makes you worthy to receive the inspiration that will guide you in making that decision.&nbsp; Inspiration about what you should do with your life after you leave here will not come to your bishop, or to President Clark, or to President Monson.&nbsp; It will come to you.&nbsp; But, it will come only if you are worthy.&nbsp; That is one way in which adherence to the honor code can enhance your agency.&nbsp; As you adhere to gospel standards, your capacity to understand - and therefore your freedome to follow - the Lord's plan for you will increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So, study and learn as much as you can while you are here, and live worthy of the spirit to guide you.&nbsp; You owe that much to those whose sacrifice in paying tithing allows you greater freedom of choice as you graduate. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me conclude with some observations about Satan's efforts to undermine the fourth -and most critical of the foundations of agency - Christ's atonement.&nbsp; &nbsp;Satan used all his arsenal to prevent that atonement from happening, unleashing, without restraint, all that he had at his disposal to prevent Christ from performing that infinitely important act.&nbsp; And, all that Satan had was considerable - it was enough to make Christ "bleed at every pore"<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;- it was enough to cause &nbsp;Christ to wish that the "cup could pass from Him"<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;- but it was not enough for Satan to triumph in that critical hour.<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Satan lost that battle.&nbsp; He cannot fight it again.&nbsp; The victory on that front is secure.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, while Satan cannot alter the reality, reach, or eternal nature of the atonement, he still wages a battle against this most important element - not by trying to undo the act itself (which he cannot do) but by challenging our faith in it.&nbsp; Satan convinces too many of us that while the atonement is real in the abstract, its infinite power does not extend to us and our sins and our weaknesses.&nbsp; In doing so, he seems to be returning to a tactic that he used so successfully with a third of the hosts in the war in heaven - persuading God's children not to believe God's promises.&nbsp; When faced with such arguments and doubts, we should respond with the same weapon that prevailed against such fallacious contentions in the original battle.&nbsp; You will remember that Satan was vanquished, and our victory in that battle assured, by the "word of [our] testimony."&nbsp; If we sometimes doubt whether the promises made by the Savior are real, or whether they extend to us and our unique situations, we can be emboldened by the reassuring fact that we believed before - and believed with such certainty that the forces of darkness were compelled to flee from our presence.&nbsp; In your moments of doubt, despair, and fear, remember that, as Elder Neil L. Anderson has taught, "faith itself is a choice"<sup>38&nbsp;</sup>- and you already made that choice once when faced with the same decision in the pre-earth life.&nbsp; Christ's promise was then, and is now, that because he would overcome all, we could overcome all. &nbsp;Now that Christ has fulfilled His promise that he would wrought an infinite atonement in order to make that possible, our choice should be even more obvious.&nbsp;<br /><br />To aid you in a small way in finding the strength to choose faith in Christ in those sometimes trying moments, let me share with you my personal witness that Christ lives and that His promises are sure.&nbsp; He has overcome Lucifer and has thereby preserved our agency. &nbsp;He loves you - each one of you - with a love deeper than you can imagine. &nbsp;&nbsp;Through his infinite atonement, He has made you free to realize your divine potential.&nbsp; He did so because He knows of your great potential.&nbsp; If you will but choose to follow Him, you will experience the fullness of joy that He has promised.&nbsp; &nbsp;I so testify in His holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>I would like to express how overwhelmed I feel to be in your presence as students and faculty, and to be able to spend time today with President and Sister Clark.&nbsp; I have a special love for this University because, both Sister Andrus and I, as well as 12 of our 13 children attended school here.&nbsp; I have spent many hours seeking the Lord's direction on what I might share with you.&nbsp; I want to first bear my testimony which I feel is worth more than anything this world can produce.&nbsp; I have received the sweet assurance through the Spirit, that God is my Father, and He is your Father.&nbsp; You and I are literally sons and daughters of a Living, Loving God.&nbsp; I testify that Jesus is the Christ.&nbsp; He is the Son of the Living God and the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh.&nbsp; He is the Atoning One.&nbsp; He is the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. &nbsp;I testify to you that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God.&nbsp; He saw the Father and the Son in the spring of 1820 as clearly as you see me, and they spoke to him, just as distinctively as you can hear me.&nbsp; I testify that Thomas S. Monson is the Lord's living Prophet upon the earth today.&nbsp; I testify that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the only true and living Church upon the face of the earth, and that all of the essential keys, powers, and authority, held by all of the prophets anciently, have been restored to the earth to bless and unite families forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, I want to share some thoughts on a commodity we have each inherited called time. As I share these thoughts and use some parables, please follow the counsel of the Savior when He was asked by His disciples why He spoke to the multitude in parables.&nbsp; He responded: "because they seeing see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand."&nbsp; He then told His disciples: "blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear."&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, my greatest desire is that you will see and hear, but more importantly, that you will feel and understand and be taught from on high by the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Nephi taught: "the Holy Ghost will show unto you all things what ye should do." In 1830, the Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith&nbsp; --"it is the eleventh hour, and the last time that I shall call laborers into my vineyard."&nbsp; (D&amp;C 33:3) The Lord also revealed in 1832:&nbsp; "Behold, I will hasten my work in its time." (D&amp;C 88: 73) What time is it? &nbsp;What is the value of time?&nbsp; Brigham Young taught that: "The property which we inherit from our Heavenly Father is our time, and the power to choose in the disposition of the same.&nbsp; This is the real capital that is bequeathed unto us by our Heavenly Father..."&nbsp;(JD 18:354)&nbsp;<br /><br />In a fireside address to the students at BYU, President Eyring said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Time passes at a fixed rate and we can't store it.&nbsp; You can just decide what to do with it--or not to do with it.&nbsp; Even a moment's reflection will help you see that the problem of using your time well is not a problem of the mind but of the heart.&nbsp; It will only yield to a change in the very way we feel about time.&nbsp; The value of time must change for us.&nbsp; And then the way we think about it will change, naturally and wisely."&nbsp;("Child of Promise", New Era 1993, p 4)</p>
<p>We either spend our time or invest our time.&nbsp; The value of my time has changed and continues to change for me as the fleeting years go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As I have pondered about this valuable commodity, I have also thought of two questions we should ask ourselves when making important decisions in our lives.&nbsp; Those questions are: 'Who are we, and 'Why are we really here?'&nbsp; When the Apostle Paul entered Athens on his 2<sup>nd</sup>missionary journey, he found an altar that had been erected with the inscription "to the unknown god." &nbsp;He boldly declared: &nbsp;"Ye men of Athens,&nbsp;...whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."&nbsp; "[He]...hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation." (Acts 17:26)&nbsp; He then declared:&nbsp;"Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by&nbsp;art and man's device." (Acts 17:29)&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of you is enrolled in this university to learn all you can, to help provide for your current or future family.&nbsp; But as you move forward in your lives, don't postpone marriage in the Lord's way, in His Holy Temple, and don't forget the Lord's commandment to multiply and replenish the earth.&nbsp; Our time on this earth is short, and like President Eyring stated, it is not "a problem of the mind, but of the heart."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />About 5 years after we were married we were living in Springville while we were attending BYU, and were actively involved in one of the wards there. At that time we had two little girls.&nbsp; I remember, as if it were yesterday, the ward having an activity in which we were invited to sing with another young couple.&nbsp; We sang the song entitled "Turn Around". &nbsp;Some of the words of that song bring back tender memories as I think about them today:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Where are you going my little one, little one?<br />"Where are you going, my baby my own?<br />"Turn around and you're two, turn around and you're four,<br />"Turn around and you're a young girl going out of the door.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Where are you going my little one, little one?<br />"Little dirndles and petticoats, where have you gone?<br />"Turn around and you're tiny, turn around and you're grown.<br />"Turn around and you're a young wife with babes of your own." <br />("Turn Around" by Harry Belafonte)</p>
<p>Our little girls were actually two and four at that time, and are now grown with seven and eight babes of their own!!&nbsp;<br /><br />I have often thought of the statement made by Jacob to his son Enos, as he concluded his &nbsp;writings: &nbsp;&nbsp;He stated:&nbsp; "I, Jacob, began to be old."&nbsp; He then said:&nbsp; "The time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream."&nbsp;(Jacob 7:26)&nbsp;<br /><br />I heard a parable of a man who had a dream and went to the City of Everywhere.&nbsp; In this city, all of the streets came together like the spokes of a wheel, and in the very center was a bank.&nbsp; On the front of the bank were the words: "Time Bank".&nbsp; People were entering the bank through the revolving doors, so he followed them to see what was happening.&nbsp; Inside the bank were long hallways with small cubicles.&nbsp; Each cubicle had a loan officer and a person wanting to borrow Time.&nbsp; They were willing to pay any interest rate.&nbsp; In his dream, he was able to overhear some of the conversations.&nbsp; (1) The first was a young lady who wanted to borrow 2 years.&nbsp; She had become an accomplished violinist, but had decided to set it aside and tour the world.&nbsp; Two years had passed, her fingers were stiff and she was unable to play as she once had done.&nbsp; With tears she pleaded for 2 years. (2) Next was a middle-aged man who wanted to borrow 3 years.&nbsp; Three years earlier his boss had come to him and said:&nbsp; "John, if I were transferred to another assignment, would you be ready to assume my responsibilities?"&nbsp; "I would advise you to prepare."&nbsp; The time had passed; his boss was transferred; John had failed to prepare.&nbsp; John pleaded for 3 years of time. (3) In the final conversation he overheard an older gentleman plead for 4 years.&nbsp; His doctor had recommended some things to keep him healthy, but he had failed to heed them. Now his health was very poor.&nbsp; He was pleading, and begging to borrow 4 years of time. With this, the man awoke; sat up in bed; and thought to himself.&nbsp; What a ridiculous dream.&nbsp; Everyone knows we can't borrow back time!&nbsp; But it caused him to ponder this precious commodity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Monson has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"This is our one and only chance at mortal life--here and now.&nbsp; The longer we live, the greater is our realization that it is brief.&nbsp; Opportunities come, and then they are gone.&nbsp; I believe that among the greatest lessons we are to learn in this short sojourn upon the earth are lessons that help us distinguish between what is important and what is not.&nbsp; I plead with you not to let those most important things pass you by as you plan for that illusive and nonexistent future when you will have time to do all that you want to do.&nbsp; Instead, find joy in the journey--now."&nbsp;(President Thomas S. Monson "Finding Joy in the Journey" Ensign Nov 2008, p 84-87 )</p>
<p>He shared portions of a letter he received:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In the 1960s, during the Vietnam War, Church member Jay Hess, an airman, was shot down over North Vietnam.&nbsp; For two years his family had no idea whether he was dead or alive.&nbsp; His captors in Hanoi eventually allowed him to write home but limited his message to less than 25 words.&nbsp; What would you and I say to our families if we were in the same situation--not having seen them for over two years and not knowing if we would ever see them again?&nbsp; Wanting to provide something his family could recognize as having come from him and also wanting to give them valuable counsel, Brother Hess wrote---and I quote:&nbsp; "These things are important:&nbsp; temple marriage, mission, college.&nbsp; Press on, set goals, write history, take pictures twice a year."</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf taught recently:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We know what matters most in life--The light of Christ teaches this to everyone.&nbsp; We as faithful Latter-day Saints have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion to teach us the things of eternal value--Our weakness is in failing to align our actions with our conscience."&nbsp;(President Dieter F. Uchtdorf "We are Doing a Great Work and Cannot Come Down" Ensign May&nbsp;2009, p 59-62)</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, as you invest your time, learn to listen and follow the promptings of the Holy Spirit, and don't try taking spiritual shortcuts.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the 1960's I learned a hard lesson when I failed to follow the promptings I received which could have cost lives and a significant amount of money.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our small trucking company operated between Idaho and Arizona. &nbsp;On one occasion, my younger brother, Heber, and I were returning from Phoenix to Flagstaff in one of our 18 wheelers when we encountered a severe blizzard. &nbsp;The weather turned much colder as the snow storm blanketed the entire area.&nbsp; We knew we were gaining 100's of pounds of additional weight and were afraid to proceed to the port-of-entry where we knew we would be overweight.&nbsp; On the other hand we didn't want to lose time by waiting out the storm.&nbsp; We stopped to ask about possible short-cuts.&nbsp; We were told there was one, and were given directions to take.&nbsp; As we proceeded down the road everything seemed fine, at first, but soon the road became narrow and questionable.&nbsp; We looked for a place to turn around but there was none.&nbsp; It was snowing so hard we couldn't see to back up. I knew we shouldn't be there and felt prompted to stop.&nbsp; However, we continued down the road and finally negotiated a curve to the right followed by a curve to the left.&nbsp; We realized that on our right side was a sharp drop off into a canyon and on our left side was a mountain range, with a rather deep gutter.&nbsp; We eventually slid off the road toward the mountain and were immediately stuck.&nbsp; I later realized that this was a tender mercy of the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />We walked back to town, a distance of approximately a mile and approached a company that operated wreckers, but after telling them where we were, they refused to come and help.&nbsp; We approached the only other company in town with equipment large enough to assist. The owner agreed to help, but needed to put chains on his wrecker. &nbsp;Finally the three of us got inside the wrecker, and after driving to the area, we backed down the road until we came to the location of the truck.&nbsp; The operator hooked the cable from his wrecker around the frame of the trailer to lift some of the weight, and allow the trailer to more easily slide back onto the road.&nbsp; However, when the pressure was applied to the cable, the front of the wrecker lifted off the ground. He looked for a tree to which he could attach the winch on the front of his wrecker to hold it down. &nbsp;&nbsp;There were only three trees large enough to offer any assistance.&nbsp; He attached to the first one, but when pressure was applied, the tree snapped and broke off like a twig.&nbsp; He then attached to the second one, but under the pressure it literally pulled out of the frozen ground roots and all.&nbsp; He turned to me and said:&nbsp; "I guess you realize that if this last tree doesn't hold, you are here for the winter?"&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />No one will ever know the feelings that went through my heart.&nbsp; I knew it was in the Lord's hands.&nbsp; I knew the impact this could have on our small business if we were stranded for the winter.&nbsp; I also wondered how I could explain to my father that we are okay and would be home soon, but the truck wouldn't be home until spring.&nbsp; It was also obvious that this last tree was about the same size as the other two. I walked to the side of the trailer, and bowed my head and silently pleaded with the Lord for forgiveness in failing to follow the promptings of the Spirit.&nbsp; I pleaded for His help. &nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think I have ever prayed harder.&nbsp; I prayed that the Lord would bless that tree with extra strength to withstand the pressure it would need.&nbsp;<br /><br />As the cable was tightened, the springs creaked and popped as the weight was lifted enough to slide the trailer back onto the road.&nbsp; (I can still hear that sound today.)&nbsp; He then directed me to get inside the truck and use the power of the engine to assist him as he pulled the rest of the truck back onto the road. &nbsp;A feeling of peace and gratitude came and I thanked the Lord for His goodness. &nbsp;It was still snowing so hard that I was unable to see out of the mirrors &nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled us backward all the way to Flagstaff while my brother stood on the running board to tell me when to turn the steering wheel to the right or to the left.&nbsp; When we finally got back to town it was dark! We had lost all day! Precious Time! &nbsp;It required all of our money to pay the wrecker fees. When it finally stopped snowing we were able to knock some of the snow off the truck. &nbsp;However, it was now a mute point.&nbsp; The port of entry was closed.&nbsp; Not only had we lost all day and all of our money, we now had to finish the rest of our trip without food. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition to the temporal lessons that were learned, the spiritual lessons were invaluable.&nbsp; I thought about everything as we drove home through the night.&nbsp; The Lord knows us personally, loves us, and warns us through the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must learn to follow His promptings! &nbsp;The Lord hears and answers our prayers, but we must first do all we can and then trust Him! &nbsp;There are no spiritual short-cuts!&nbsp; The adversary wants us to believe that it's easy to return to the strait and narrow path, but he is the great deceiver.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As I thought about the trees, I compared the first one to people who won't withstand peer pressure and will break rather than keep the commandments.&nbsp; Don't be one of them! &nbsp;I compared the second tree to others whose testimonies are weak and lack the depth of conversion.&nbsp; They are like the seed planted in stony places that have no root in themselves and when tribulations or persecutions arise, they are offended.&nbsp; Strengthen your testimonies daily!&nbsp; The tree that stood strong I compared to parents, bishops, stake presidents, and good friends who will assist us when we take the wrong road.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There are those who will refuse to help.&nbsp; They are like the priest who 'saw' and the Levite who 'looked' and then passed on the other side of the road, as depicted in the Story of the Good Samaritan.&nbsp; Don't be one of them!&nbsp; The man who helped us onto the road and back to that point where we had departed from the path, was like the Good Samaritan who "came where we were and had compassion on us." &nbsp;Be like the Good Samaritan!&nbsp;<br /><br />This experience has influenced the decisions I have made throughout my life.&nbsp; Time is an inherited commodity, there is a time appointed for us, and precious time is lost forever when we take the wrong road. &nbsp;The only way back from spiritual short cuts is repentance. It requires a change of heart and a change of directions.&nbsp; The atonement of the Savior is the one sure foundation we can always rely on.&nbsp; This experience was indeed a wake-up call.&nbsp;(Matthew 13:20-21)&nbsp;<br /><br />Amulek received a wake-up call from an Angel and was told to bring Alma to his home and feed him and care for him.&nbsp; Amulek had previously been rebellious. &nbsp;However, he was taught and reminded of many things by the Angel.&nbsp; He then accompanied Alma and testified to the wicked people of the City of Ammonihah. &nbsp;&nbsp;He told them: "I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore, I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling against God, in the wickedness of my heart."&nbsp;(Alma 10:4, 6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Approximately 12 years later, Amulek, who had learned the importance of this life, taught the Zoramites:&nbsp;"This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God, yea behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors. And now, as I have said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore I beseech of you, that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed."&nbsp;&nbsp;(Alma 34: 32-33)&nbsp;<br /><br />This life is the time to Prepare, to Perform, and to Improve.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>We PREPARE</strong>&nbsp;by building upon the rock of Christ as Helaman taught his sons:&nbsp; "And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation, that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea his shafts in the whirlwind, yea when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you<strong>down</strong>&nbsp;to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall."&nbsp;(Helaman 5:12)&nbsp;<br /><br />It was Jacob who said: "Before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.&nbsp; And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted." (Jacob 2:18-19)&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>We PERFORM</strong>&nbsp;by doing as King Benjamin taught his people:&nbsp; "If ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants."&nbsp; He also helped them understand that:&nbsp; "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."&nbsp;&nbsp; We perform by serving others.&nbsp; We perform by loving others.&nbsp; We perform by "bearing testimony to all the world - those things which are communicated unto us."&nbsp;(D&amp;C 84:61)&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>We IMPROVE&nbsp;</strong>by "putting off the natural man and becoming a saint through the Atonement of Christ the Lord, and becoming as a child, Submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [us], even as a child doth submit to his father."&nbsp;(Moses 3:19)&nbsp;This is a lifetime process.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Nelson taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Your life will be a blessed and balanced experience if you first honor your identity and priority.&nbsp; Keep a good, long-range view, knowing that the days of retirement from your work will come.&nbsp; There will also be an end to your mortal life.&nbsp; For the hale and hearty,those realities seem pretty remote--about the last things they worry about.&nbsp; But the day of your demise is coming, and eventually you will stand before the Lord in judgment."&nbsp;(Elder Russell M. Nelson, "Identify, Priority, Blessings" CES Fireside at BYU, September 10, 2000)</p>
<p>Are we ever guilty of saying that 'sometime' we will change or sometime we will do a particular thing?&nbsp; When is 'sometime?'&nbsp; Is it tomorrow?&nbsp; Is it next month or next year?&nbsp; Webster defines 'sometime' by saying:&nbsp; It is "At some unspecified time, not known, in the future."&nbsp; It is an example of procrastination, which means: "To put off doing something unpleasant or burdensome until a future time, (especially) to postpone such actions habitually."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Hafen gave a talk entitled "Planning to Repent".&nbsp; He said: "There is something especially perverse about "Planning to Repent" in the very act of transgression.&nbsp; This is twisting a sublime source of healing to make it actually inflict more sickness, like poisoning the medicine in the hospital for wounded soldiers."&nbsp; "Planning to Repent" is an affront to the Savior, because it assumes that we control our own forgiveness.&nbsp; While we must do "all we can do" to be worthy of Christ's Grace, we cannot turn that miraculous power on and off like a water faucet." (Elder Bruce C. and Marie Hafen, "Planning to Repent" Church News, December 14, 1991)&nbsp;<br /><br />As we go through life we often make our plans, use our calendars and outline our agendas, but do we consider the Lord's timetable?&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith:&nbsp; "There is a time appointed for every man, according as his works shall be."&nbsp;(D&amp;C 121:25)&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord also revealed: &nbsp;"And again, it shall come to pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed."&nbsp;(D&amp;C 42:48)&nbsp;<br /><br />Forgive me, but I would like to share three powerful Wake-up calls in my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />In 1971, my father became so ill that he was hospitalized and was not expected to live.&nbsp; He was in the intensive care unit and the doctors told us that we needed to bring our family together as quickly as possible.&nbsp; My father invited me to come to his hospital room and bring a notebook so he could give some final instructions about his estate.&nbsp; He then said:&nbsp; "Son, I would like to receive a Priesthood blessing, and would like you to be the voice in that blessing."&nbsp; As a family we started fasting, and those who lived away arrived as soon as possible.&nbsp; We went to an empty room in the hospital where we knelt in prayer and closed our fast.&nbsp; It was a long walk down the hall to my father's room.&nbsp; We surrounded his bed, laid our hands upon his head and proceeded with the blessing, but there was nothing.&nbsp; I said a few words, and pleaded in my heart that the Lord would let me know what I should say.&nbsp; Of course we wanted him to live, but we knew that the Lord was in charge, and that His will would be done.&nbsp; Suddenly it seemed almost like a book was opened and I knew exactly what I was to say.&nbsp; I blessed my father to get well, and promised him that he would serve missions, (plural), for the Church.&nbsp; As I left the room I thought what have I done?&nbsp; Did I really listen to the promptings of the spirit?&nbsp; Did I say what I wanted to happen? The doctors were so certain that he would not live, why did I make all those promises? &nbsp;As I pondered the blessing, I knew that the Spirit had spoken clearly to my mind and heart. Dad slowly recovered, and soon left the hospital.&nbsp; From 1972-1973, he served with my mother on a stake mission.&nbsp; From 1975-1976, they were called on an 18 month mission to Calgary, Canada.&nbsp; From 1977 to 1979 they served for 18 months in Anchorage, Alaska.&nbsp; Upon returning, they served in the temple for nearly 10 years.&nbsp; The Lord knows the time appointed, and that decision is not ours to make.&nbsp;<br /><br />In 1982, my wife and I had talked about how blessed we had been as a family.&nbsp; We knew several others who had gone through adversity, and wondered when our day would come. &nbsp;It came at 6:00pm on December 28<sup>th</sup>, 3 days after Christmas. &nbsp;It was a life-changing wake-up call.&nbsp; Our oldest son, Brian, who was a deacon at the time, was playing on the snow machine we had purchased for Christmas.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had gone on his last ride, taking his cousin along.&nbsp; It was getting dark.&nbsp; He was killed instantly as they hit a sprinkler line on wheels, which was not visible because of its height and its silver color against the snowy field.&nbsp; The impact knocked Brian off the machine and broke his neck. His cousin was not injured. &nbsp;Every fast Sunday, Brian, had been the first one to bear his testimony and express how much he wanted to go on a mission.&nbsp; We envisioned he would receive a call like most young men at the age of 19.&nbsp; Our lives were changed!&nbsp; Our hearts were broken!&nbsp; Our spirits were more contrite!&nbsp; Our empathy for others was more pure!&nbsp; The following month, on the 26<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of January, my wife and I went to the temple to do his work.&nbsp; I felt his presence with me as I was ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood and received the endowment for him.&nbsp; It was an emotional experience at the veil, and I wept as I felt him quickly leave, and knew he was happy to begin preaching "in the great world of the spirits of the dead." (D&amp;C 138:57)&nbsp;<br /><br />My most recent Wake-Up Call came in 2004 when I had, what I thought was a strained muscle near my clavicle.&nbsp; After I went through the various tests and felt good about everything, the doctor entered the room.&nbsp; He was very direct.&nbsp; His exact words were:&nbsp; "The results are positive; you have multiple myeloma; there is no cure, and you're going to die in 3-5 years."&nbsp; I was speechless and didn't dare look at my wife.&nbsp; I thought to myself:&nbsp; "That's not your call."&nbsp; However, after going through radiation, chemotherapy, and finally a complete stem cell transplant at the Huntsman Cancer Center my eyes have again been opened and I realize how short mortality is, how fragile it is, and how easy it is to forget who is in charge.&nbsp; There is a "time appointed for us" in mortality.&nbsp; We can't afford to waste time.&nbsp; We must strive to understand the Atonement and live worthy so that Our Savior can say:&nbsp; "Father, "spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life." (D&amp;C 45:4-5)&nbsp;<br /><br />I felt that I had an understanding of the Atonement after serving as a missionary and a mission president, and after memorizing several scriptures about the Atonement. However, as I went through those harsh days during the stem cell transplant procedure with my temperature approaching 104, and the mucous lining of my mouth, throat, stomach, and intestine being destroyed from the chemo injections, I gained a deeper appreciation and understanding of the spiritual, physical, and emotional sides of the Atonement. The pain was unbearable. I pleaded with the Lord during those long painful days and I received, what I believe, is extended time.&nbsp; How long is that time?&nbsp; It really doesn't matter!&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me quickly review a few points for you to ponder:</p>
<p>As President Monson said:&nbsp; "This is our one and only chance at mortality."&nbsp;<br /><br />I will conclude with the words of verse #2 from the hymn "Improve the Shining Moments":</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Time flies on wings of lightning; We can-not call it back."It comes, then passes forward Along its onward track."And if we are not mindful, The chance will fade away,"For life is quick in passing.&nbsp; 'Tis as a single day." (Hymns, "Improve the Shining Moments" no 226)</p>
<p>I again bear testimony of the precious commodity we have inherited; our time. &nbsp;I know God is in charge and we will return to His presence at "the appointed time."&nbsp; Let's live so that it really doesn't matter when.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>First Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p>Bio not available.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sister Hafen and I are SO GLAD to be with you today.&nbsp; We love this school and we love you. We will spend the rest of our days trying to show our gratitude for the gift of being allowed to live here with our family for seven years.&nbsp; Back then, the two of us occasionally shared the time at this pulpit. We want to do that again today, partly because our topic somehow invites us to teach together.<br /><br />One of our daughters, then in her late teens, once asked me an interesting question:&nbsp; "Dad, how come there are only two kinds of guys in the Church?&nbsp; There are guys who are righteous -and boring; and then there are guys who are kind of wild--and pretty interesting!&nbsp; This is really hard!"&nbsp; I replied, "When I was your age I had the same question.&nbsp; Some girls I liked with my head--I knew I should date a girl like that.&nbsp; And other girls I liked with my heart--but I knew I probably shouldn't date them.&nbsp; It&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;hard!&nbsp; But then, one day, I met your mom and my head and my heart got together.&nbsp; And the rest is . . . genealogy."&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma taught his son Shiblon that it's possible to be both righteous and interesting.&nbsp; He said, "Bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love."&nbsp; Good words, bridle and passion. So are passions good or bad?&nbsp; Is there a place in the gospel for passion?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Centuries ago, some early Christians thought passions--deep human feelings--were mostly evil.&nbsp; So they built monasteries and convents where monks and nuns would not be so tempted by those passions they believed were so worldly.&nbsp; I guess that is one option--to run away from passion.&nbsp; But now, partly in an over-reaction to the rigid and frigid controls of the past, society has swung the pendulum completely to the opposite extreme. Most people today say--be as passionate as you want to be, whenever and wherever.&nbsp; If it feels good, do it, and no worries about tomorrow or next week.&nbsp; This is the age of the disposable relationship and the one-night stand.&nbsp; The flame of casual sex burns like a comet through the sky and then it's gone--sometimes burning your whole house down when it lands.&nbsp; In the words of one Broadway song, "When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near."&nbsp; That's the world's current approach to passion, and it is wrong.&nbsp;<br /><br />The truth is that neither the monasteries nor the modern world has got it right.&nbsp; Passion is actually good, really good.&nbsp; In fact, God himself has a body, parts, and passions.&nbsp; We know that Jesus wept, sometimes for sorrow, sometimes for joy--always over people He loved.&nbsp; He taught us to love with all our hearts--even to love God with a passion.&nbsp; And you know those romantic feelings inside us that respond with such power, or other deep feelings like joy and excitement?&nbsp; God gave us those feelings because they are part of His nature, and He created us, His children, to be like Him.&nbsp; God does not want us to extinguish the passionate yearnings of our hearts.&nbsp; He wants us to fulfill them, but He wants to teach us how to find their full expression.&nbsp; That is exactly why He gave us the bridle of the gospel--so we can be filled with the fire of our God-given passions without being destroyed by that fire.&nbsp;<br /><br />Marie and I want to share with you our favorite illustration of what it means to "bridle your passions that you may be filled with love."&nbsp; When President Hinckley sent us to Australia some years ago, we knew only two things about that country:&nbsp; kangaroos, and the movie,&nbsp;<em>The Man from Snowy River</em>, which was filmed in Australia. &nbsp;Some of our children had watched that video so often that they could say the dialogue before the characters did.&nbsp; So we were quite excited one day as we drove from Sydney toward Melbourne and crossed a bridge near a sign that said "Snowy River."&nbsp; Not only is that a real river, but the movie is based on a true and much loved Australian legend about a young man who single-handedly rounded up a herd of wild horses in the mountains.&nbsp; Today we'll show you two clips from this movie, which is full of memorable metaphors and lessons about horses and love and growing up.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me tell you about Jim Craig,&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;young man from Snowy River.&nbsp; Jim has grown up in the high mountain country of southeastern Australia.&nbsp; He is our hero, and Jessica Harrison is our heroine.&nbsp; Because Jim's father has been killed in a logging accident, Jim comes down to the flat to find work.&nbsp; He finds a job at Harrison's ranch, or in Australian terms, his "station."&nbsp; Harrison is Jessica's father.&nbsp;<br /><br />In this first clip, watch how Jim's and Jessica's relationship unfolds.&nbsp; It is not a pretty start.&nbsp; As the scene begins, Jessica is practicing the piano, as her aunt Rosemary says, "with all the sensitivity of a road mender." (That might mean like a jackhammer.)&nbsp; Play it, she says, "con amore."&nbsp; Play it with love, with passion.&nbsp; Jim comes in.&nbsp; Both Jim and Jessica are frustrated because they have been left behind at the station while the stockmen (that's Aussie for cowboys) have gone to round-up the cattle.&nbsp; Their meeting begins with a misunderstanding. But Jim finds a smooth way to patch it up.&nbsp; When Jessica sits down to practice again, for some reason, she does play with a little more "con amore."&nbsp;<br /><br />While you watch their friendship start to grow, notice how Jim handles Harrison's high spirited, expensive colt.&nbsp; What does he mean when he says, "you work with a horse, not against him?"&nbsp; What do you think is the&nbsp;<em>goal</em>&nbsp;of "breaking" a horse?&nbsp; Is it literally to break the horse's spirit?&nbsp;<br /><br />As you watch this, ask yourself, "What does the breaking-the-colt analogy have to do with me?"&nbsp; Ask how that process applies to your lives--in dating of course, but also in your education, in learning another language, in playing an instrument or a sport, or in developing any discipline. &nbsp;And, at the very end of this scene, look for the fire, that symbol of passion.&nbsp; Where is the fire?&nbsp;<br /><br />SHOW CLIP #1&nbsp;<br /><br />Marie:&nbsp; So where was the fire?&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>In the fireplace!&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Before we go on, let's look at an actual bridle. &nbsp;Maybe we can see more clearly what Alma means by the metaphor "bridle your passions that ye may be filled with love."&nbsp; Perhaps my handsome hired hand might help me here.&nbsp;<br /><br />To explain: the "bit" is usually made of metal, with either a crook or a hinge in the middle, which is held in place in the back of the horse's mouth by leather straps and buckles.&nbsp; When the rider wants to talk to the horse, he or she moves the reins so that the crook or hinge in the bit is forced into the soft palate of the horse's mouth, or relaxed away from it. Through the movement of the "bit," the rider communicates with the horse.&nbsp; A well-broken horse is one that has become very sensitive to the signals he receives from the rider--his master.&nbsp;<br /><br />What did Jim do to break Harrison's prize young colt so well?&nbsp; He took&nbsp;<em>time</em>--a lot of it--the horse and master talking to each other through the bridle and the bit.&nbsp; Through Jim's patience and kind firmness came trust and responsiveness.&nbsp; As Jim told Jessica, "You've got to be firm with a young horse, not cruel. . . .That's what my father taught me."&nbsp; If a horse is not well-broken, he can't receive or "hear" changes in the rider's signals.&nbsp; Then the horse's passions can go wild and bad things can happen.&nbsp; On the other hand, what is the goal of the horse being well-bridled, well-broken?&nbsp; You don't want to break the horse's spirit--quite the opposite.&nbsp; A well-broken horse will give more, not less; and the horse and the rider can work together as one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example. Our friend, Martha and her family, have a favorite horse, Hawkeye--a beautiful, high-spirited Arabian with lots of fire.&nbsp; He's well-broken, but he can get too feisty when he hasn't spent enough time with a good rider.&nbsp; One day a lot of inexperienced riders had been on Hawkeye and his energy started to run unchecked, literally.&nbsp; When she jumped on him thinking she'd settle him down a bit, they took off out of the barnyard too fast. He didn't respond to her signal down the lane, and instead of turning right, he ran full-steam through a barbed wire fence.&nbsp; Luckily, neither one was badly hurt, but she saw that she and Hawkeye had some work to do.&nbsp; She made sure they spent a lot of time together over the next days and weeks.&nbsp; Nearly everywhere she had to go on the ranch she rode Hawkeye and they "talked."&nbsp;<br /><br />A few weeks later about 200 head of cattle needed to be moved to new pastures.&nbsp; The job fell to Martha and Hawkeye.&nbsp; They got the cattle rounded up and moving, but one cow spooked and the whole herd bolted.&nbsp; But because horse and rider had spent so much time together, and because Hawkeye was so well bridled now, they saw the job the same way.&nbsp; Hawkeye would instinctively jump towards the lead cow even as Martha was thinking the thought.&nbsp; Reeling around and riding from one fence line to the other they managed to turn the herd in the right direction, but not without having to dance eye-to-eye with a few cows.&nbsp; As Martha wrote, "We were completely together with every move.&nbsp; It was pure, well-bridled, highly passionate&nbsp;<em>instinct</em>!&nbsp; His instinct had become the same as mine.&nbsp; We were one!&nbsp; And it was so much fun!"&nbsp;<br /><br />So how does the Hawkeye story apply to each of us?&nbsp; As we grow up, we are in some ways like a high-spirited horse, full of energy and passion, but we still need training and bridling--self-discipline.&nbsp; We need for ourselves what the wise old man told the young mother she needed to give her baby boy.&nbsp; "Teach him to deny himself," he said.&nbsp; "Teach him to say 'no'."&nbsp; Heavenly Father will teach us this kind of self-discipline--when to say 'no' and when to say 'yes.'&nbsp; He is our Master and He loves us.&nbsp; He will teach us that when we take His word into us, we learn to see with His eyes and to feel with His heart; our instincts meld into His instincts.&nbsp;<br /><br />What are the bridles that teach us to hear and feel our Master's slightest directions and guidance?&nbsp; In this analogy, a bridle is anything that trains the natural man out of us and conditions us in the discipline of Godliness.&nbsp; For example, we could talk about the bridles contained in&nbsp;<em>For the Strength of Youth</em>.&nbsp; We need to say 'no' to some things, like immodest dress, harsh and obscene music and language, or any immoral choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />On the "yes" side, we could talk about all the good things you've already done.&nbsp; You have bridled yourselves to read the scriptures every day, to go to early-morning seminary, to pray, to treat your family with kindness, to repent of weaknesses, to say "no" to yourself so that you can say "yes" to maintaining your integrity, and to missions and endowments and marriages and children sealed in the covenant.&nbsp;<br /><br />Most of you on this campus are not teenagers anymore.&nbsp; You are young adults and, "Dorothy, you're not in Kansas anymore." You're more mature, better at responding to the lightest touch of the Master's signals to you. &nbsp;So are you ready to give more to Him?&nbsp; And are you ready to give more to others&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;Him?&nbsp; Which of your passions may still need more complete bridling?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We've heard some young adults be candid about where they need more self-control. &nbsp;Here are some samples:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Procrastination.</strong></span>&nbsp; Some lack the discipline to do what they need to do when they need to do it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Diversions.</strong></span>&nbsp;Some spend too much time with electronic gadgets, playing games and wandering aimlessly through the virtual universe.&nbsp; They're more interested in Facebook than in real faces.&nbsp; Others wish they had the discipline to study harder and to not go along with every distraction their friends dream up.&nbsp; I remember a sign one girl put on her apartment table, "Homework makes you ugly."<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fears.</strong></span>&nbsp;Others are prisoners of their fears, fears about going on a mission or coming back from one; fears about being rejected by an employer or by someone they want to date; fears about the responsibility of marriage or of being a mom or dad in a very wicked world.&nbsp; Some don't want to get out of their comfort zone.&nbsp; Others don't want to change and repent.&nbsp;<br /><br />A bridle functions much like a yoke--in essence, a bridle built for two.&nbsp; The Lord beckons us to take upon ourselves His yoke, His bridle, that we might become whole and holy.&nbsp; But that is a choice we must make.&nbsp; So what bridles do you choose to help you overcome your fears and your distractions from who you really want to be?&nbsp; Here are a few of mine.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Praying--asking more specifically because I know from experience I will get more specific answers.<br /><br />2. Studying scriptures--reading for more information, yes, but I also know that every time I open the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, I feel that I am opening a connection with my Heavenly Father and with His Son that nourishes and expands my heart, making it deeper, able to know more and feel more.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Finding the best ways to stay&nbsp;<em>tender</em>&nbsp;to God's touch, tender to His instructions.&nbsp; For me, fasting helps.&nbsp; Doing something for someone else anonymously, or who is not easy to help, helps get me out of my "me-ness."<br /><br />4. The Temple--where heaven meets earth--helps me.&nbsp; I'm glad to hear that many of you line up for hours to do baptisms for the dead in the Rexburg Temple.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Finally, could simple faith and courage be your bridle because you trust your Master with your whole soul?&nbsp; Even when the challenges loom very large, and the future looks dark, would you shout, like Caleb of old, "Give me this mountain?"&nbsp; Give me this mountain of my own life, my own husband or wife, my own children, my own wholeness and holiness.&nbsp; We can have Caleb's courage because we know who will win this war.&nbsp; Good is stronger than evil.&nbsp; God is stronger than Satan.&nbsp; And, our Father keeps His promises.&nbsp; Our Master promises us that if we wear His bridle, if we are steady in Him, if we are at one with Him, He will bring us home, His home and ours--a place we can't find without His help.</p>
<p>I wish that every Moroni on every one of our 120 plus temples could trumpet this clear &nbsp;call to every young adult in every valley and mountain and city and town in the entire world--that He will help you, that He loves you and that He wants nothing more than for you, for all of us, to come Home, to be with Him, to be like Him, with our families, with our friends forever, "to go no more out."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I desire that for you with my whole heart--for you and for me.&nbsp; And I bear witness of Him as the Master who will teach us and help us to come Home.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.&nbsp;<br /><br />BRUCE:&nbsp; Let me add a couple of examples to what Marie said about certain bridles today. &nbsp;&nbsp;The electronic world is a runaway passion that really needs a strong bridle. Can you imagine what stirring romantic conversation would have occurred in that first movie clip if Jim had walked in listening to his i-pod, and Jessica had been playing a computer game instead of the piano?&nbsp; Their guardian angels would have needed to send them both a text message to let them know an interesting person of the opposite sex was even in the same room.&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you think I'm kidding?&nbsp; Someone who was a student here several years ago recently came back for a visit and wondered if he was in the same place. Before, he said, students on campus often greeted and talked to each other. But now, many are so constantly connected to a virtual world than they have disconnected themselves from each other.&nbsp; Some even text during school classes and Church meetings. But if you are tuned&nbsp;<em>out,</em>&nbsp;how can you be tuned&nbsp;<em>in</em>?&nbsp;<br /><br />One BYU-I faculty member sees a disturbing trend among some of his students.&nbsp; They have become so accustomed to easy answers on Google and short messages on their phones that they have a hard time coping with serious reading assignments, let alone the essential processes of research, analysis, and discovery.&nbsp;<br /><br />One young couple loved playing computer games with each other as their favorite way of dating before they got married. After they were married, their basic needs forced them to talk through a few fundamentals, like actually living with another real person.&nbsp; They soon discovered that they hardly knew each other. &nbsp;Then one of them began computer dating again to escape the demands of paying attention to a live companion under real-life conditions. Before long, sadly, the marriage ended. Their foundation was just too shallow.</p>
<p>The urge to view pornography is another example of unbridled passion, especially when it becomes coupled with misdirected behavioral habits.&nbsp; I have talked with men who told me what it's like to become literally addicted to pornography.&nbsp; Even when they wanted to quit, even when they hated it, they were as chained to it as if they were drug or alcohol addicts. &nbsp;Ann Poelman once said that an addiction is an ever-increasing craving for an ever-diminishing satisfaction.&nbsp; The downward behavioral spiral demanded by that ever-increasing craving explains how pornography can lead to conduct and attitudes that end up destroying marriages.&nbsp;<br /><br />Imagine the tragic irony--fake romantic love can destroy true romantic love.&nbsp; What a dirty trick--one of Satan's dirtiest, because it turns passion into the enemy of true love rather than letting passion fuel the fulfillment of true love.&nbsp; The problem with pornography is not that there's something wrong with passion.&nbsp; The problem with pornography is that it makes you lose the bridle that connects your passions to the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me say that another way.&nbsp; Do you think God gave us the commandments because He doesn't want us to experience the deepest satisfactions of which the human soul is capable?&nbsp; Is the gospel a wall built around joy and fulfillment to keep us out?&nbsp; The prophet Jacob said, "Do not . . . labor for that which&nbsp;<em>cannot</em>&nbsp;satisfy."&nbsp; Remember that.&nbsp; Do not labor for that which&nbsp;<em>cannot</em>&nbsp;satisfy.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters,&nbsp;<em>the problem is not that the world's way is too satisfying.&nbsp; The problem is that the world's way isn't satisfying enough.</em>&nbsp; It cannot satisfy.&nbsp; It doesn't have the power.&nbsp; It is a tragically cheap imitation of the real thing.&nbsp; The real thing is&nbsp;<em>full</em>&nbsp;of authentic, bridled, eternally committed love and passion.&nbsp; Maybe that's part of what Elder Neal A. Maxwell was thinking when he said, "The laughter of the world is just loneliness trying to reassure itself."&nbsp;<br /><br />One other perspective.&nbsp; Some years ago I knew a young woman whose life kind of wandered off the fairway and into the rough. &nbsp;She made some serious mistakes, but repentance and the Savior could have helped her come back.&nbsp; However, in utter frustration, her mother once said to her, "You are damaged goods! No worthy priesthood holder will ever want you!"&nbsp; The girl burst into tears. I'm sorry to say that she believed her mother, and she went on living as if she really were damaged beyond repair.&nbsp; If anyone today feels even a little as she did, or if you have a friend who does, please know that no matter what damage you have known, your condition need not be permanent.&nbsp; You are God's literal son or daughter.&nbsp; He loves you and He can completely heal any damage.&nbsp; If you need to repent or you need to forgive, you will discover that because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, you can learn from your mistakes without being condemned by them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, let's go back to Jim and Jessica whose relationship has been growing.&nbsp; In one later scene, Jessica has an argument with her father, stomps out of the house, and rides off on her horse to go find Jim who is in the mountains rounding up some stray cows.&nbsp; Jessica rides into a heavy thunderstorm.&nbsp; Jessica's horse falls and she slides off a sheer cliff.&nbsp; She clings to a small ledge screaming for help.&nbsp; Jim hears her and comes to her rescue.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jessica is cold, soaking wet, and terrified. Jim finds a place to build a fire and ties his rope between two trees where Jessica hangs her wet clothes.&nbsp; She wraps herself in a blanket and sits on a log.&nbsp; So there they are, young, in love, and alone by a cozy fire in the mountains.&nbsp; You don't have to be very creative to imagine what they are probably thinking.&nbsp; But as they talk, they realize that they need to wait.&nbsp; They both need to settle things with her father before starting into their own marriage.&nbsp; So they&nbsp;<em>choose</em>&nbsp;to bridle their passions.&nbsp; Somehow they sense that even though they love each other, sacrificing short term cheap thrills will make possible their true long term happiness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later on, Curley, the ranch rascal, allows Harrison's expensive colt to escape and run off with a herd of wild horses, the brumbies. He makes this look like Jim's doing.&nbsp; So Harrison calls in all the neighboring stockmen to help him with a high action round-up, and he doesn't want Jim's help.&nbsp; But Clancy, the legendary local horseman, convinces Harrison that only Jim and his mountain horse know the mountains well enough to find and capture the brumbies.&nbsp; The men chase the wild herd until they are all exhausted and they return to Harrison's place empty handed.&nbsp; Then suddenly, here comes Jim alone, having rounded up the brumbies all by himself.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's pick up at that point with another clip.&nbsp; Watch what Jim is able to do because&nbsp;<em>he&nbsp;</em>and his horse are so well bridled.&nbsp; Listen for why he rode.&nbsp; Listen for the title he earns when he says he'll be coming back for Jessica. You will hear "Spur" say, "He's not a lad, brother, he's a man." &nbsp;Then in Clancy's words, "The&nbsp;<em>man</em>&nbsp;from Snowy River." So this is a story about how a boy becomes a man and a girl becomes a woman. &nbsp;Then listen especially when Jim's horse runs in a big circle and Jim shouts just&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;word that says how he is feeling about all of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />MOVIE CLIP #2:&nbsp;<br /><br />So what was the word?&nbsp; "Wahoo!"&nbsp; Let me tell you about that little house in the mountains. It was built for the filming of this movie. When we were in Australia a few years ago, it was still there--about a three hour drive north of Melbourne.&nbsp; Because of how we feel about this story and the message we've shared today, we just had to see the house. We drove into the mountains as close as we could get, then hiked the last thirty minutes. &nbsp;As we walked across the front porch, I picked up Marie, kicked open that front door, and shouted, "Wahoo!"&nbsp;<br /><br />So when you have kept your covenants and bridled your passions enough that you are ready to enter the temple with your eternal companion, you have our permission to look at each other just before you walk through the front door of the temple and say, "Wahoo! We made it!"&nbsp; What a day that will be--whenever it comes.&nbsp;<br /><br />And when the two of you reach our stage of life in a few more decades, you will think of that same image of the little house and "coming home" in another way.&nbsp; Some day, Marie and I will be ready to go home, home with a capital H. &nbsp;I can already picture it.&nbsp; When we both get there, we will approach some sacred, eternal front door together.&nbsp; The light on the front porch will be on and inside there will be a fire in the fireplace.&nbsp; We will cross that threshold together, entering the presence of Him whose Atonement made our eternal sealing possible.&nbsp; And we will kneel together at His feet to thank Him for giving us the bridle that makes it possible for us to be filled with love--everlastingly.&nbsp; And we will stay there with Him, with our family, and with our eternal friends, and our fire will go no more out.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Former President, Helsinki Finland Temple</p>
<p>Bio not available.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>A few months ago, Sister Luthy and I returned from serving in the Helsinki Finland Temple. Our time there was a highlight in our lives. Since returning home we have had occasion to share some of our experiences with friends. One of the stories that Sister Luthy likes to relate concerns an impressive Russian couple who came to the temple to be sealed. The wife had been a high government official in Kazakstan and the husband had been a high-ranking officer in the Soviet Military. They had found the Church through the good example of an America businessman who is now a General Authority Seventy, Elder Pieper. The Russian brother told us that during his early years in the military, he had received harassment because he had Jewish-sounding name, so he decided to change it. Not having a knowledge of the Old Testament, he chose a name that he thought would free him from the Jewish connection. The name he chose was Solomon. Apparently no one seemed to recognize the irony, so he kept it.<br /><br />Brother Solomon was able to attend General Conference some time ago and after attending the Priesthood Session, he lamented, "If only I had known about this earlier in my life, I could have raised sons in the Priesthood." If he were to visit this university today, I think he would have a similar lament about how he wished his children could have attended BYU. He would recognize how blessed you are to have the Gospel and to be here. But like every new convert in the Church, he now begins to build his own legacy, and to record his own history from which future generations will benefit. In years to come, I believe others will read about his experiences and his faithfulness, and it will help them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our tradition in the Church of recording our own histories and reading the histories of others is motivated by serious business. The Book of Mormon teaches us that those who kept records prospered but those who did not dwindled in unbelief. Having records so they could access the past through the written word was so important to the Lehi colony that it justified the slaying of Laban.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Records of the past can provide us with good role models, build faith, and otherwise give guidance and inspiration. In the few minutes we share today, I would like to review with you a few journeys that we read about in the scriptures, journeys that teach and inspire. Then, with your indulgence, I will dare to share some personal events from my own life journey that I hope will help someone.&nbsp; But first, the scriptures:&nbsp;<br /><br />The earliest account of a journey that we have in the scriptures is the departure of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, as they apparently traveled eastward from their first home. They left a secure place and traveled into a never-before-experienced mortal world with all its challenges and blessings, but they carried with them the knowledge of a future atonement that would allow them one day to return to the presence of their Father in Heaven.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;In the meantime they were to do all that they needed to do to fulfill the purpose of their creation. Their life journey was not without difficulties or heartaches; they even had a son who killed his brother, but they were not entirely alone. By faith and obedience they received guidance through revelations to sustain them and lead them on their way.&nbsp;<br /><br />The journey of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage is one of&nbsp; the most famous journeys recorded in our scriptures. After years of preparation, Moses led that stiff-necked nation in the wilderness for 40 years. Even though they had experienced miracles and the graciousness of God, they had a hard time getting it right. If they had, it probably wouldn't have taken them 40 years. Despite their weaknesses, the Lord was good to them. He even led them with special signs by day and by night. Among other things, they were privileged to have the tabernacle, a portable temple to help them draw close to God.&nbsp; In their temple worship they reflected on the earlier journey of Adam and Eve. The tabernacle and the later temple in Jerusalem were built facing east. Once a year, on the Day of Atonement, the high priest would go from east to west through the veil of the temple into the Holy of Holies, symbolically reversing Adam and Eve's journey from the Garden of Eden, and symbolically reversing the effects of their fall.<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Temple worship then and now enjoys elevating symbolism to impress on the mind sacred things.&nbsp;<br /><br />We see the pattern of journeys repeated with Lehi and his family leaving Jerusalem to save their lives and to preserve a record for their posterity, and ultimately for us. More than once, Nephi referred to the journey of the Israelites in order to strengthen his brethren. When he was confronted with opposition to building a ship, he delivered a powerful sermon to his brothers about the Israelites' journey from Egypt, and how God dealt with them in the wilderness. His sermon was so powerful that it confounded his brothers and they were afraid to even touch him.<sup>4&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>Other prophets in the Book of Mormon also reflected on the Israelites' journey in order to lift and inspire their people. By recalling the recorded past, they could remind the people who they were, how they should live, and that God would bless them if they would turn to Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />The journey of our own pioneers into the Salt Lake Valley parallels these other journeys in many ways. The pioneers were sustained by their faith, by the revelations received by prophets, and by the covenants they had made. They considered themselves similar to&nbsp; the Children of Israel, being led by a prophet to their own promised land. They recognized that the land that one day would become Utah had some things in common with the Holy Land. Both had a dead sea, or a Salt Lake, and that "sea" was fed from waters coming from a freshwater "sea," Utah Lake, so the pioneers naturally named the river that joined these two inland seas the Jordan River. They also gave place names associated with places or people in the Bible. As a result in Utah we have a Mt. Nebo, a Mount Pisgah, and a Mount Magog, and communities bearing names such as Providence, and Moab, and Ephriam. We also have names from the Book of Mormon journey,&nbsp; such as Bountiful, Nephi, Lehi, and Moroni. These are concrete examples of how the past finds a place in our present.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of these difficult journeys was punctuated with the need for faith in the face of adversity; each had its own revelations and sublime teaching moments; each received divine guidance as the travelers turned to God. Each is a legacy that can support us in our own journeys. We are blessed that someone kept a record. As with Adam and Eve, a time comes when each of us must leave a place of security and step into an unknown world in order to grow. For you, coming to BYU-Idaho was one of those steps. Going on a mission is another. Many of you will soon be taking such steps in education, employment, and marriage, and each will have it own tests and blessings. Each will require faith and persistence. The examples of obedience of others who have taken such steps can help us, if we are receptive to the lessons they teach and follow the counsel of President Hinckley to "go foreward with faith."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We know the journeys of Moses, Lehi, and our pioneers were fraught with physical trials, and that not everyone survived. The journeys we travel today may lack those physical challenges, but they have other trials, and they are saturated with electronic distractions and&nbsp; messages that appeal to our selfish desires, urging us to take detours. The messages are almost deafening in their intensity and numbing in their frequency. As if that were not enough, we are also dogged by the mocking and counterfeit philosophies that come from the "great and spacious building" that Lehi saw in vision.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Such messages sow pride, doubt, and dissension. In the face of all this opposition, it is gratifying to confirm that most of your generation in the Church is still getting it right, or at least close to right, on this part of your journey.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is encouraging to learn that studies indicate that the more education LDS members get, the more they ignore the great and spacious building, and the tighter they hold on to the iron rod. Studies show that as the general population of&nbsp; this nation receives more education, they are less believing and less active in religion, but as LDS members receive more education they continue to be believing and are more active. A study a few years ago showed that of the LDS members who have only elementary school education, 41% attend church regularly, but of those who have graduated from college, 76% attend church regularly, and of those who go on to graduate school, 78%&nbsp; attend church regularly.<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>These figures give hope that for LDS students at least, as education is gained, faith and activity do not dwindle; they remain strong. We do not fear knowledge. We embrace it. And we proclaim that the glory of God is intelligence. We seek education so we can have, in Brigham Young's words, "Education is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the world's work, and the power to appreciate life."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Another study of LDS scientists revealed that 94 percent of them believe that Joseph Smith was an inspired prophet in restoring the Church of Jesus Christ, and that Jesus is a divine personage in the Godhead.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;This percentage was in contrast to only 40% of other U.S. scientists who believe in Christ.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;The surprising find that 94% of LDS scientists were believers prompted the researcher to question the results of his study and to redo it. He did, with another sample, and received the same result.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />What are we to make of such findings? Is it possible that LDS scientists are in possession of information that most other scientists lack, information that sustains faith and motivates activity? The profound truths we have received through the restoration of the Gospel are just that, both faith sustaining and activity motivating.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Perhaps another study should be done to reveal more clearly why such a high percentage of LDS scientists have strong faith, because we know that high educational achievement alone does not guarantee faithfulness. Both wise and unwise use of agency can be found at all levels of formal education. Developing our gifts is only part of the equation. Using those gifts in righteous ways is the other part. It is heartening to learn that most LDS scientists seem to have it right, and are in harmony with Nephi's observation, "to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />So here we are, moving ahead on our own journeys, trying to get it right. Although our journeys are in a different time period from Moses' or Lehi's, or even the pioneers' experience, in the end, I think we will realize that in many ways, our journeys have not been very different from theirs. We will find that not all travelers survive the distractions or the false philosophies. Some will not&nbsp; have the patience to wait upon the Lord and will choose instead to worship their own golden calves. But those who hold fast to the iron rod will have blessings multiplied beyond their expectations. The Apostle Paul knew this when he reminded the early saints that, "Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;I don't believe that we have to wait for the next life to experience some of what he was talking about. Many of the blessings in this life can exceed our expectations.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have learned that in spite of our weaknesses, the Lord is gracious and eager to bless us in ways that we do not anticipate, if we seek him. In my own journey, I have been blessed in ways that most people, including myself, would consider very unlikely, all things considered.&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, when I was a freshman at Utah State University, one of my&nbsp; professors suggested that I major in English, because he felt the Utah schools ought to have more male English teachers. Feeling very insecure and inferior,&nbsp; I rejected the idea for two dumb reasons. 1) The amount of reading required seemed excessive for someone who found reading difficult and was extremely nearsighted (I have since had eye surgery to correct that), and 2) Anyone who studied English had to study a foreign language for at least two years, and foreign language study was the farthest thing from my mind. Foreign language was only for those smart girls who majored in English. Real men studied engineering.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then an interesting thing happened. I received a call to serve a mission in Finland. Missionary Training Centers did not exist in those days, so we served for two and a half years to have more time to study the language. After a few days of orientation in Salt Lake City, a small group of us were off to Finland by train, then by boat, by train again, and another boat, and finally by bus. It was a long trip in the days before missionaries flew on Delta. Once in the country, I studied hard and discovered that the language was an amazing system. I was captivated by it and realized I enjoyed language study, and I hoped to do more with it some day. But, after my mission I found very few opportunities to use it. I pursued other avenues for my undergraduate work, and studied the small amount of Russian that the school offered. Then, one day shortly before graduation, I saw a small announcement in the student newspaper for those who spoke less-commonly taught languages. Finnish was certainly a less-commonly taught language. I followed up on the announcement and soon found myself in a graduate linguistics program at Indiana University, something that had been very unlikely.&nbsp;<br /><br />My graduate program in Indiana had its challenges, among which was my being a single, aging, returned missionary in a non-LDS environment. As some discontent with&nbsp; my studies grew, and my social isolation continued,&nbsp; even though I had received an award to do research in Finland for the next fall semester,&nbsp; I began to consider leaving my graduate program for a season and returning to Utah to take a job I had been offered. Then one Sunday morning as I walked up the sidewalk to attend Stake Conference, I met another student, far more spiritually mature than I, named Bud Patterson. I mentioned that I was thinking of leaving my program for a time and explained the reason why. Unlike other friends who simply wished me good luck, he stopped abruptly and asked: "Do you pray?" I answered "yes." He said "Then if God has brought you this far, why would you consider turning back now?" He saw me on a journey that I should not forsake, simply because it had become onerous. He spoke inspired sense. He was the friend who helped me in the time of need. I think of him as a ministering angel. I decided that I would not leave my studies; I would go forward.&nbsp;<br /><br />I accepted the research opportunity and arrived in Finland in the middle of the week, eagerly awaiting Sunday when I could meet old friends in the Helsinki chapel. As I greeted members at the door, a new face entered the chapel, and I immediately wanted to get acquainted with her. That person was to bless my life from that moment on. Of course, it was Sister Luthy, who was a student at the University of Helsinki. She helped me with my research then, and has been helping me in everything ever since. Without her, little of what I have experienced professionally or in the Church would have happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Was the small notice in the student paper or the meeting with Bud Patterson on the stake house sidewalk mere coincidence? What if I had decided to stay away from Stake Conference that Sunday. Was my unanticipated, unlikely meeting of my future wife which followed these events coincidence? Or were these special blessings of guidance, divine micro-management, intended to lift someone who didn't want to study English to a position where he could serve others?&nbsp; (Incidentally, my first teaching position as a linguist turned out to be in an English department.)&nbsp;<br /><br />It seems that my life has been filled with things that I once said I would never do. I once said I would never study a foreign language, and I ended up a linguist; I once said I would never have an international marriage, and I have one. Now I am considering saying that I will never be a multimillionaire.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have found that one of the ironic facts of life is that many of the most significant things in our lives result from seemingly small events or decisions. May we be in the right spirit to choose wisely when such things happen at unpredictable times.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord's guidance didn't cease with our wedding, but has been a gentle blessing though the years. It should not be surprising that a scripture that echoes in my mind is, "In nothing doth man offend God or against none is his wrath kindled save those who do not confess his hand in all things..."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;I am quick to confess the hand of the Lord in my own journey. His hand is in your journey, too. I hope you will be receptive to it. The counsel given the early leaders of the Church as they began their journey of establishing the Church still applies to us: "Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good,&nbsp; if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one with another."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The journey that those early leaders were on is really the same one that we are on. It can be daunting at times and it can also be exhilarating, but it should never be boring. Can you imagine Joseph Smith being bored with his assignment to be the prophet of the Restoration? I believe the Lord had his undivided attention. One can hardly<strong>&nbsp;</strong>imagine the weight of responsibility he must have felt. In the midst of constant harassment and persecution, he carried the responsibility of translating and printing the Book of Mormon, of organizing the Church, of starting missionary work, of building temples, of lifting and inspiring thousands of converts, and establishing communities. He alone held all the keys of the priesthood. It was Joseph's responsibility to see that the message of the restoration was taken to all the world. And, he was doing this while he was not much older than you are.&nbsp;<br /><br />With so much at stake, it is not surprising that Satan's efforts to destroy the prophet and the Church were so intense in the early 1840s.&nbsp; The winter of 1843-44 was a particularly trying time. Knowing that his time on earth would be cut short, Joseph met frequently with members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to instruct them and give them priesthood keys necessary to govern the Church. Then, in March 1844, he called the brethren together and "charged them to govern the Church after his death, explaining that he had conferred upon them all the ordinances, authority, and keys necessary to do so."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Joseph said<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>"I roll the burden and responsibility of leading this church off from my shoulders onto yours. Now, round up your shoulders and stand under it like men; for the Lord is going to let me rest awhile."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />What relief he must have felt when he was able to confer the priesthood keys on the quorum of twelve apostles. Finally, others would share the responsibilities. No longer did it all depend on him. The Twelve were fully vested fellow travelers on the journey. Where are those keys and who have the responsibilities today? Yes, President Monson and the apostles have all of those keys, but they, too, share some of them and the responsibilities with other leaders throughout the Church. As the Church grows, more members will carry more responsibilities to bring the kingdom to the rest of the world<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The journey that those early leaders undertook in order to establish the church and bring it to the world continues today, only there are more travelers are on the trip. That journey was not only Joseph Smith's journey; it was not only the early saints' journey; it is also our journey; it is your journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is a legacy that you are inheriting. You don't have to do it all today or this year, or this decade, but you will do much before your journey is over. For now, your main task is to get as much education as you can, and to serve appropriately along the way.&nbsp; As you continue, you, too, will be asked in various ways to "round up your shoulders" and carry the work forward. If you follow the example of your faithful forbears, you will get it right to your everlasting benefit and to the benefit of those who will follow you. You will have unanticipated trials, opportunities, and blessings. I hope that your lives will be filled with unlikely surprises that will be great blessings to you, too. One day the stories of your life journeys will be told to your posterity. May they be a great blessing to them, and may you enjoy the guidance of our Father in Heaven on this wonderful journey.<strong><a target="_self"></a></strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Former President, Ricks College</p>
<p>Bio not available.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>What a glorious sight you are!&nbsp; Marj and I are delighted to be back on this beautiful campus, with the wonderful students, faculty and staff of this institution.&nbsp; We treasure the time we served here--at then Ricks College.&nbsp; While we have been gone nearly 13 years, we recognize many familiar faces of terrific colleagues/friends.&nbsp; I extend our commendations to President Clark, his administrative team and all who serve here for the amazing progress, growth and development of BYU-Idaho.&nbsp;THE LORD HAS HIS HANDS IN THIS PLACE!&nbsp; You may have heard the prophetic statement of Jacob Spori, the first principal/president of this school who stated:&nbsp; "<em>The seeds we are planting today will grow and become mighty oaks, and their branches will run all over the earth</em>."&nbsp;<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>This statement reminds me of a story.&nbsp; We went on a tour of Europe and the Middle East.&nbsp; Our first stop was in Amsterdam.&nbsp; During the brief layover we visited a place that sold cheese and wooden shoes.&nbsp; The charming host was a handsome young Dutchman who spoke flawless English.&nbsp; He asked:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Where are you from?"</em>&nbsp; A number indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Idaho!"</em>&nbsp; And he immediately responded:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Free Taters for out of staters!</em>"&nbsp; Yes--he had attended Ricks College and we witnessed again the inspiration of Jacob Spori's prophetic foresight.<br /><br />Several decades ago a play was written entitled:&nbsp; "Saturday's Warriors".&nbsp; I remember a moving line from that play where one teenager says to the other:&nbsp; "<em>Once you know who you are, nothing else really matters!"</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing our identity is indeed important.&nbsp; To know both your mortal and spiritual roots, certainly can make a profound difference in your life. In a recent devotional here, Elder Russell M. Nelson stated: "<em>Your personal identity is everlasting and divine.</em>"&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(See Doctrine &amp; Covenants 93:29)&nbsp;<br /><br />This helps explain why there is such universal appeal to the hymn:&nbsp; "<em>I am a child of God</em>."&nbsp; I wish I could replay for you a fireside of the Korean Branch in Queens, New York.&nbsp; On one of our son Mark and Kristine's and their family's two visits to our mission in New York, we held a fireside for the Korean Branch at the mission home.&nbsp; We must have had 50 or more people of all ages crammed into the mission home. Our precious granddaughters and their parents sang&nbsp;<em>"I am a Child of God"</em>&nbsp;in Korean.&nbsp; It touched the hearts and minds of members and potential members there and set a sweet tone for the fireside.&nbsp; Mark then spoke to them in Korean, the language he used as a missionary 15 years previous.&nbsp;<br /><br />New York City is a melting pot of the world.&nbsp; People come there from virtually every nation.&nbsp; During a short ride on a NY subway you might hear a dozen different languages.&nbsp; There is a sizable population of Chinese in New York.&nbsp; Two of the six official mission languages are Mandarin and Cantonese.&nbsp; Many of the Chinese immigrants to New York have grown up without a religious background or a belief in God.&nbsp; The Chinese-speaking missionaries often recounted the joy of teaching someone they are a child of God, the son or daughter of a Father in Heaven who loves them.&nbsp; Familiar and simple as this truth is to you and me, it was a startling and refreshing new truth to many of them.&nbsp; And yes, many responded readily to this soul satisfying doctrine, one they had inherently sensed; it was a REDISCOVERY OF A TRUTH they had known before.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Athens, Greece is a city long known for its learning and the dwelling place of noted Greek philosophers who lived before Christ such as Plato, Socrates and Aristotle.&nbsp; Centuries later Paul the Apostle visited Athens and noted it was a "<em>city wholly given to idolatry</em>." (Acts 17:10)&nbsp; Paul ascended to Mars Hill and there boldly decried their false teachings:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious...as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.&nbsp; Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.&nbsp; God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that He is Lord of heaven and earth...is (not) worshiped with men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;&nbsp;and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him, though He be not far from every one of us.&nbsp; For in Him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, for we are also His offspring."&nbsp;<sup>3</sup></em></p>
<p>What should it mean to you and me to know our true identity, who we really are?&nbsp; As children of God we are invited to develop His attributes of love, learning, kindness, patience, forgiveness, meekness, courage, good will and the list goes on.&nbsp; Yes,&nbsp;<strong>WE ARE INVITED TO BECOME LIKE HIM</strong>! In a recent gathering of friends who served missions in Scotland in our youth, I heard the following story from one of my former companions, Joseph McConkie.&nbsp; While serving as a chaplain in Viet Nam during that conflict and war, Brother McConkie was responsible for helping meet the spiritual needs of LDS servicemen.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that at military headquarters, there was an assembly hall where religious services were held.&nbsp; At that time the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was not viewed as a major religious denomination so the time for religious services given them was 4:00 P.M. on Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; One day, following their meetings, a soldier who was responsible for the upkeep of the assembly hall said:&nbsp; "<em>I want to join your Church</em>."&nbsp; Joseph asked:&nbsp; "<em>What has prompted this desire</em>?"&nbsp; The soldier replied:&nbsp; "<em>I watch your people come to Church each week in the late afternoons--and they come happy.&nbsp; When they leave, they are even happier!</em>"&nbsp; No doubt this soldier could see the light of the gospel emanating from the faces of those soldiers who rejoiced every week in the great privilege of worship and fellowship--even in the difficult circumstances in which they found themselves.&nbsp;<strong>THESE SOLDIERS KNEW THEIR IDENTITY AND IT BLESSED OTHERS</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />I think you know what a great opportunity you have to come and learn at this remarkable university. Indeed, it is a rare privilege!&nbsp; Following your short season of study here, you will go to places all over the United States and the world to work, to raise a family or perhaps undertake even more study.&nbsp; Your identity as a child of God goes with you, no matter where you go. Your identity is nurtured and reinforced in marvelous ways on this campus, in your student wards, and in your apartments.&nbsp; I offer three things you can do to reinforce your foremost identity as a CHILD OF GOD wherever you may live.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>LOVE AND PURSUE INSPIRED LEARNING<br /></strong>In this information age, there are so many things to learn and there is not time to pursue them all.&nbsp;Many things you will want to avoid.&nbsp; You must be selective.&nbsp; Still, there are books and articles that will enhance your life, your confidence and your vision of who you are.&nbsp; Elder Neal A. Maxwell spoke of the compelling need to have our learning be more than the accumulation of knowledge:&nbsp;<em>"The mere accumulation of knowledge without purpose and of information without wisdom, constitutes ever learning but never coming to a knowledge of the truth"&nbsp;<sup>4</sup></em><em><sup></sup></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have a list of good books that you are reading or plan to read when you have more time--beyond those required readings for your classes?&nbsp; Is scripture reading a daily anchor in your life?&nbsp; Busy as we all are, daily time feasting on the word of the Lord brings bountiful blessings.&nbsp; Daily scripture study helps us understand who we are and why we are here.&nbsp; Two short scriptures depict how vital this is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...<em>feast upon the words of Christ, for...the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do."&nbsp;<sup>5</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;</em>(2 Nephi 32:3)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever."&nbsp;<sup>6</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup></em>&nbsp;(Isaiah 40:8)</p>
<p>The Lord teaches us in a revelation to the prophet Joseph Smith: "...<em>seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by STUDY and also by FAITH."&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;</em>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:118)<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the same revelation, the Lord asks us to learn&nbsp;<em>"...things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms."&nbsp;<sup>8<strong>&nbsp;</strong></sup></em>(Doctrine and Covenants 88:79)<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>You can link almost any discipline taught on this campus to some of the language of this revelation.&nbsp; It may inspire you to learn all you can--even about disciplines beyond your chosen major.&nbsp;<br /><br />On this campus and at other universities there are foundation and general education courses to provide a broad framework for learning before you specialize in your major.&nbsp; Doing your best in these foundation courses is important.&nbsp; I want to share a personal experience, a mistake in my education, which illustrates the point.&nbsp; In high school math was NOT my favorite subject.&nbsp; I took math classes each of the first three years of high school but decided not to my senior year.&nbsp; When I selected a major at the university I discovered that math was not required and so I took no math as an undergraduate student.&nbsp; When I was accepted and received a fellowship to attend graduate school, I was relieved to learn that "calculus was not a required prerequisite for the program."&nbsp; When I entered the required "Quantitative Methods" class on the first day, I painfully learned that this simple course title of quantitative methods covered differential and integral calculus and high-powered statistics based on the calculus.&nbsp; Not only had it been seven years since my last math class, but I had not taken college algebra and trigonometry which are prerequisites for calculus.&nbsp; I needed a miracle to launch me across this huge knowledge chasm.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next Sunday at Church I met my miracle, a Ph.D. student in philosophy by the name of Cody Carter.&nbsp; When I learned that Cody held bachelors and masters degrees in mathematics, I quickly and desperately inquired:&nbsp; "<em>Could I hire you to tutor me in math?"&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>His quick answer:&nbsp; "<em>No!"&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;I was on the verge of tears before he said:&nbsp; "<em>But I will be happy to be your tutor without pay."&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>With Cody's expertise in math and patient tutoring, through my own extensive sweat and toil, and positive encouragement from Marj, I was able to complete the class and not have to repeat it.&nbsp; That was indeed a miracle!&nbsp; The moral of this anecdote is NOT to procrastinate as I did, but to dive into the courses you will need--even if they aren't your favorites.&nbsp; As Abraham Lincoln said, "<em>I'll prepare now and take my chances on what comes."</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to share an example of someone who prepared and learned in advance and great blessings have come to many from his learning.&nbsp; His name is Cole Durham.&nbsp; He was a young, founding faculty member of the BYU Law School when it started in l977.&nbsp; Elder Dallin H. Oaks, then President of Brigham Young University, invited and charged the Law School faculty to develop some area of expertise and knowledge that would be helpful to the Church.&nbsp; Brother Durham followed that counsel and chose to learn all he could about religious freedom and laws and principles related to it.&nbsp; Fast forward to l989 and the Berlin Wall came tumbling down.&nbsp; Countries behind the Iron Curtain had languished without religious freedom and were now interested in establishing laws and practices that would foster religious freedom.&nbsp; Professor Durham made numerous trips to many of these countries offering expert advice and much tangible help.&nbsp; By heeding President Oaks' counsel he was prepared to meet a vital need and many nations have come to recognize and be blessed by his timely and invaluable help.&nbsp;<br /><br />Two concluding examples of learning come from my parents. Mother served as the cultural refinement teacher in Relief Society for a long time.&nbsp; She loved it.&nbsp; She acquired a sizable library of books and maps about the countries and cultures throughout the world.&nbsp; She loved this and other &nbsp;callings.&nbsp; She used to say around the dinner table:&nbsp; Sister__________ is the best read sister in the ward.&nbsp; She loves good books and is always sharing inspiring insights.&nbsp; While this sister was not able to attend college because she needed to help support her family in the Great Depression when she graduated from high school, she always loved to read and learn and adopted this habit throughout her life.&nbsp; My mother was speaking of&nbsp;<strong>Sister Marjorie Hinckley</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />My father spent much of his life teaching, learning and writing. The last decade of his life he had Parkinsons' disease.&nbsp; While his body gradually broke down, his active mind continued to yearn for learning.&nbsp; He would often say a person needs to use his mind or his brain to fulfill his nature as God's child and unless he gets excited about ideas, about learning; unless he reads books and talks about ideas, and not just the weather and people, he will not fulfill that nature.&nbsp; On one visit to his home during the last year of his life I said:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>"</strong>Dad, what are you reading?"&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;He said:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"The Book of Mormon."</em>&nbsp; I said, where are you in the book and how long have you been reading it?&nbsp; His reply:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"I began Monday and I'm in Moroni."</em>&nbsp; It was Wednesday. Even with this debilitating disease, his mind was still alert in his late 80's because he had always used it.&nbsp; To fulfill your divine nature, PURSUE AND LOVE INSPIRED LEARNING!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILLINGLY SERVE OTHERS<br /></strong>One of the classic statements from King Benjamin's masterful discourse is often quoted:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...<em>I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."&nbsp;<sup>9&nbsp;</sup></em>(Mosiah 2:17)</p>
<p>Elders Engstrom and Low were walking down the street in Long Island one sunny, spring afternoon--dressed in slacks, white shirts and ties.&nbsp;They saw an elderly, white-haired man shoveling in a huge pile of dirt.&nbsp;They walked over and asked if they could help.&nbsp; He readily accepted.&nbsp; They shoveled for a while with Lou Vigliotti and then said:&nbsp;<em>"Could we come back on Saturday dressed for the occasion and help you finish shoveling?"</em>&nbsp; Lou said:&nbsp;<em>"That would be nice."</em>&nbsp; On their return they brought two more elders and they moved that huge pile rather quickly.&nbsp; In the process they had an extensive discussion with Lou about the gospel.&nbsp;He invited them to his home and he began attending Church.&nbsp; In a month's time Lou joined the Church.&nbsp; At his baptism, this 80 year-old man said:&nbsp;<em>"I feel like I have found my home!"</em>&nbsp;He now understood more fully his purpose on earth and his true identity.&nbsp;All because two elders seized the opportunity to give timely service!&nbsp;<br /><br />Shoveling dirt seems like a pretty mundane task.&nbsp; President Kimball reminds us that: "<em>Mundane service can be of great value. &nbsp;God does notice us, and He watches over us.&nbsp; But it is usually through another mortal that He meets our needs.&nbsp; Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom. . .So often our acts of service consist of simple encouragement or of giving mundane help with mundane tasks--but what glorious consequences can flow from mundane acts and from small but deliberate deeds."&nbsp;</em><sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I share a story about a student some years ago at this school.&nbsp; She began in the fall semester. She was discouraged and remained in her apartment, didn't attend many activities and went home at Christmas and told her Mother:&nbsp;"<em>I don't think I want to go back.&nbsp; I'm just not having a good experience or much fun."&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Her mother reflected for a few minutes and then said:&nbsp; "<em>Camille, I want you to return next semester and do just one thing every day.&nbsp; Each day I want you to do something for someone that is not expected or required--just go out of your way to render needed service for someone.&nbsp; Will you try that for a semester and then see how you feel?"&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Camille agreed and returned to school.&nbsp; She took her mother's advice to serve someone each day.&nbsp; Within two or three weeks she couldn't believe how happy she was.&nbsp; By focusing on others and less on herself, she felt better about herself and others.&nbsp; After about five weeks some of her friends encouraged her to run for a student office.&nbsp; She ran and was elected.&nbsp; Her service as a student officer was outstanding as she continued doing daily service!&nbsp; Camille learned the sweet impact of the Savior's counsel: "<em>He [she] that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."&nbsp;</em><sup>11&nbsp;</sup><em></em>&nbsp;<br /><br />Service is also a wonderful way to heal us when we face heartache and even tragedy in our lives.&nbsp; How touching it has been to learn about the events in Haiti over the past two months!&nbsp; The loss of life and extensive human suffering have been heart-wrenching.&nbsp; The loving response of so many has been heart-warming.&nbsp;<br /><br />This campus and community knows the name of Brady Howell, one of 188 killed in the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon.&nbsp; The son of long-time Ricks College employee Ken Howell and his wife Jeanette, Brady was working as a presidential management intern in Naval intelligence with a promising career ahead of him.&nbsp; His wife Liz was beginning her promising career in nursing and the medical field.&nbsp; Her life was dramatically changed with this tragedy.&nbsp; Brady &amp; Liz, who met and courted on this campus, had their dreams disrupted.&nbsp; From a recent Church News article, Liz stated:&nbsp;"<em>I realized there are other people in the world who are suffering, and while I by no means am an expert on grief or trial, I'm acquainted with grief.&nbsp; I realized at that point that I wanted to serve others with all my heart, with everything that I had, and I realized that I had been blessed so much after the loss of my husband, and comforted so much."&nbsp;</em>That is what helped her decide at age 30 to serve a mission to Portugal.&nbsp; Liz noted that "<em>I took the responsibility to channel my grief in a positive direction."</em>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup><br /><br />She has been part of an LDS team rendering humanitarian relief in Haiti. And the peace of service has helped bind her broken heart.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yes, through acts of service, special consequences flow.&nbsp; I have often wondered what course my life may have taken had I not found a very competent math tutor at a timely moment WILLING to serve.&nbsp; The greatest joys in life are found through giving and sometimes receiving WILLING SERVICE TO (or from) OTHERS!&nbsp; As you reach out to others you strengthen your confidence in who you are.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>HAPPILY OBEY THE LORD'S COMMANDMENTS<br /></strong>Samuel taught that "...<em>to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."&nbsp;</em>(see I Samuel 15:22)&nbsp; Perhaps you have wondered why obedience is the first law of heaven?&nbsp; We have been taught by prophets that the purpose of life is to be tested, "...<em>to see if</em>&nbsp;(we)...<em>will do all things whatsoever the Lord...(our) God shall command...</em>" (see Abraham 3:24-26)&nbsp; By proving ourselves faithful in this testing process, we show that we can be trusted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord's commandments are loving advice from our Heavenly Father to lead us to happiness, to strengthen our identity of who we really are, and who we can become.&nbsp; It is a straight and narrow path but also a path of protection and safety.&nbsp; Obedience to God's commandments is the covenant we renew each week to remember the promised blessing that accompanies diligent efforts to&nbsp;<em>"always have His Spirit to be with us."</em>&nbsp;(Doctrine &amp; Covenants 20:77) A recurring theme in the Book of Mormon reminds us of this promise:&nbsp; " . . .&nbsp;<em>inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and . . . inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God, ye shall be CUT OFF from His presence."</em>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;(Alma 36:30) To prosper means economic blessings; but I believe that the larger blessing and meaning of "prosper" is to enjoy the Lord's Spirit and influence in our lives as we HAPPILY hearken to His commandments.&nbsp;<br /><br />The hymn we sang&nbsp;<em>"I am a Child of God"</em>&nbsp;in its initial version had the phrase:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"...teach me all that I must&nbsp;KNOW".</em>&nbsp; A prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, suggested to the composer, Sister Naomi Randall, that the phrase be changed with just one word:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"...teach me all that I must&nbsp;DO".</em>&nbsp; This is the same prophet who simply said:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"DO IT!"</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a prophetic reminder of how important our actions are!&nbsp;<br /><br />As a young missionary in Scotland, President David O. McKay tells of a time in his mission when he had "become discouraged and homesick . . ."&nbsp; As he and his companion walked they saw " . . .an unfinished dwelling, (and) over the front door . . . was a stone on which there was some carving.&nbsp; He walked over to see what it said and saw "...a striking motto carved in stone--it read: 'WHATE'ER THOU ART, ACT WELL THY PART. . .' "&nbsp; President McKay took this statement as a direct message to him and he said:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"The Spirit said to me, 'You are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ...and you are a representative of the Church and you are to act well your part as a missionary and you should get into the work with all your heart.'"</em>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Blessings that come from obedience are abundant.&nbsp; President McKay spoke of one of these: "<em>To have the approval of your conscience when you are alone with your thoughts, is like being in the company of true and loving friends."&nbsp;</em><sup>15</sup><em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;To have peace of conscience in this life is a cherished blessing.&nbsp;<br /><br />Remembering the Lord's love and purpose for each of us as His children provides motivation to hearken to the Lord's teachings as Elder Neal A. Maxwell stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>I believe with all my heart that because God loves us there are some particularized challenges that He will deliver to each of us.&nbsp; He will customize the curriculum for each of us in order to teach us the things we most need to know.&nbsp; He will set before us in life what we need; not always what we like.&nbsp; And this will require us to accept with all our hearts the truth that there is divine design in each of our lives and that we have rendezvous to keep, individually and collectively."</em>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>The Lord knows you and loves you.&nbsp; You were prepared to come to earth at this time.&nbsp; This is both a great opportunity and responsibility.&nbsp; Like the LDS soldiers in Viet Nam, you are to make a difference by how you live, by the Spirit you radiate, and by the power of your examples.&nbsp; The importance of how you live and obey the Lord was clearly taught by Alma:&nbsp;<em>"And trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister, except he be a man of God, walking in His&nbsp; ways and keeping His commandments."</em>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I love the following thoughts from two inspired leaders of youth:&nbsp; From Elder Glenn Pace:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>". . . we will remain much safer and infinitely happier if we will place our energies in current obedience rather than saving them for future repentance."&nbsp;</em><sup>18</sup></p>
<p>And from Sister Ardeth Kapp:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>These commandments are given not to restrict us, but to redeem us; not just to reform us but to exalt us."</em>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;Elder Maxwell helps enlarge our vision concerning your divine potential:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>My beloved young friends, you are the vanguard of the righteous spirits to be infused into the Church in the last days.&nbsp; Back beyond time, it was so determined and you were prepared--before the foundations of the world--to help save others in the latter-day world.&nbsp; You cannot keep this resplendent rendezvous if you become like the world!&nbsp; Make your righteous marks on the world instead of being spotted by the world."&nbsp;</em><sup>20&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>As you make righteous marks by faithfully following the Lord's commandments, you understand why obedience is the first law of heaven.&nbsp; Obedience is heaven's law which opens the door to the cherished blessings in God's great plan of happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember, as you&nbsp;<strong>LOVE AND PURSUE INSPIRED LEARNING, WILLINGLY SERVE OTHERS,&nbsp;AND HAPPILY OBEY THE LORD'S COMMANDMENTS,</strong>&nbsp;you will nurture and re-enforce your powerful identity as a CHILD OF GOD.&nbsp; Your identity, which is "EVERLASTING AND DIVINE," makes all the difference in enabling you to fulfill your divine nature--in how you live now and what you can become!<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Dean of Students</p>
<p>Bio not available.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am humbled by the responsibility to address you, and whole heartedly pray for the Holy Spirit to be with you and me, that we may all leave edified.<br /><br />All of you are in the right place and at the right time.&nbsp; But, why are you here right now?&nbsp; The reasons will vary, for some it is a duty, for others it is social, but how many are here as an expression of love? &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Consider for a moment the scene when the Savior posed three times the same question to his beloved apostle, Peter.&nbsp; The question, "Simon, Son of Jonas, Lovest thou me?" (John 21:-15-17)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, liken this scripture unto us, and listen to the Savior, calling you by your name, and even stating your father's name in assuring his personal acquaintance with you.&nbsp; Hear that same question in your mind, "Lovest thou me?" not just once, not just random, but specifically, and lovingly to you, from one who loves you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I would imagine that like Peter, three times we would respond, "yes", and like Peter we would discover that a verbal response is not a full indicator of love.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">We love God First and Foremost<br /></strong>I remember well when in the stage of falling in love with my wife, and knowing we wanted to share an eternity together, she informed me that before any engagement it was a requirement to first ask for permission from her father.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we left Provo to take a trip to Mesa, Arizona.&nbsp; I recall during those hours of traveling, rehearsing in my mind what I might say.&nbsp; However, a greater fear of the unknown response of her father raced in my heart.&nbsp; What if he said no?&nbsp;<br /><br />I waited until the very last moment on the last evening.&nbsp; After supper and finishing washing dishes, we were all in the living room.&nbsp; The television was off, we were just sitting there, her parents, Darla and I.&nbsp; Whenever the conversation grew quiet, Darla would nudge me, and finally she prompted me by saying "Kevin has something to say". &nbsp;I blurted, "Darla has told me I need to ask you for her hand". &nbsp;And in trying to lighten the tension, I said, "but, I don't just want her hand I want all of her."&nbsp; Her dad didn't crack a smile, and her mother started to cry.&nbsp; I sat there knowing this didn't work well, but fortunately, when he finally responded it was a "yes", but with some stern instruction about what he expected from his future-son-in-law.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I became a father, I determined as my daughters become of age and they had young men who wanted to marry them, I wanted a similar fearful experience for them.&nbsp; A sort of craving for justice I suppose.&nbsp; And so I required each prospective son-in-law to set up an interview with me prior to any engagement. &nbsp;I've enjoyed this.&nbsp; As they sat down, I told them, I have two questions for you.&nbsp; The first is, who do you love and will you love the most, the Lord or my daughter?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Their answer to this question was crucial to me as I knew it would set the tone for their marriage and eternal journey.&nbsp; It would tell me where their heart really was, and what treasure they would pursue.&nbsp; How would you answer this question?&nbsp;<br /><br />The answer is quite simple, and was given by the Savior when questioned, "What is the greatest commandment?" He responded, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.&nbsp; This is the first and great commandment" (Matthew 22: 37-38).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I knew that if both future son-in-laws had as their foundation loving God first and foremost, they would truly love my daughters best.&nbsp; By the way, they did answer the question correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Loving God first is not only the foundation for romantic love, but for everything we do.&nbsp; For as the Savior stated, "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets" (Matthew 22:40).&nbsp;<br /><br />President Ezra Taft Benson taught, "When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives. Our love of the Lord will govern the claims for our affection, the demands on our time, the interests we pursue, and the order of our priorities."&nbsp; (President Ezra Taft Benson, "The Great Commandment - Love the Lord" Ensign, May, 1988)&nbsp;<br /><br />However, something we need to remember as we strive to keep this commandment, is that before we loved God, He loved us first.&nbsp; We discover the genealogy of love by pondering scriptures from the book of John.&nbsp; First, the Savior pronounced, "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you" (John 13:34).&nbsp;&nbsp; This standard of love for us did not come without the Savior understanding of the first love.&nbsp; In the great intercessory prayer offered by Lord recorded in John 17, Jesus prayed, "for thou hast lovest me before the foundation of the world" (John 17:24).&nbsp;<br /><br />The commandment to love our Heavenly Father first and foremost is not given as an egotistical need for reciprocation, but rather an instructive course for life direction.&nbsp; President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught, "God the Eternal Father did not give that first great commandment because He needs us to love Him. His power and glory are not diminished should we disregard, deny, or even defile His name. His influence and dominion extend through time and space independent of our acceptance, approval, or admiration.&nbsp; No, God does not need us to love Him. But oh, how we need to love God!"&nbsp; (President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "The Love of God", Ensign, November, 2009)&nbsp;<br /><br />Love is the source of everything God does for us.&nbsp; It is by love we were created, as well as everything that is about us, whether it is below the earth, on the earth, or above it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is by love we are given commandments.&nbsp; It is by love the great plan of redemption was set.&nbsp; And it will be by love that we will be able to return to His presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />And so as our Heavenly Father has set the pattern of love, so we must learn to love as He does &nbsp;to become as He is.&nbsp;<br /><br />Your membership in the kingdom, and your presence here at BYU-Idaho is testimony of God's love for you.&nbsp; Lehi prophesied, "that there shall none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord" (2 Nephi 1:7).&nbsp; Not only can you witness how the "hand of the Lord" led you or your progenitors to this land, but more specifically, I hope you all recognize the personal hand-led guidance you have received to be here in Rexburg, Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Your presence here is a testimony of God's love and recognition of you.&nbsp; The question is how will you reciprocate this love?&nbsp; What fruit you produce while at BYU-Idaho and in the future will all answer the question, "Lovest thou me?"&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">By your fruit you show who you love the most<br /></strong>Consider for a moment, the Prophet Zenos teaching of the allegory of the olive tree found in Jacob 5.&nbsp; As Nephi instructed, let us "liken" this particular passage of scripture "unto us", for our "profit and learning" (1 Nephi 19:23).&nbsp; Consider this great University as a good olive tree, for some of you, the Lord's choice of Rexburg may seem to be planted in the "nethermost part of the vineyard", but nonetheless, it is a good tree.&nbsp; It is a tree that has been personally planted by the Lord. Its roots are good, they have been nourished a long time for the purpose that the Lord may "lay up unto himself against the season much fruit".&nbsp; Consider yourselves as branches brought from all around this world and are grafted to this great tree of BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; The process of grafting occurred when you made a covenant to abide by the honor code according to the Law of Witnesses, with your signature and those of the Lord's servants, your Bishop, and a member of the Stake Presidency.&nbsp; Like in the allegory, the Lord has prepared this tree.&nbsp; He and his servants have and continue to nourish this great tree by diligent loving labors of digging, pruning, and dunging.&nbsp; Look about you, and you can literally witness this, as construction of new buildings, remodeling and tearing down of old, and the constant creation of new technologies, methodologies, and modalities are a testimony of the Lord's hand in providing the best tree possible to lay up good fruit.&nbsp; It has grown and developed in a very methodical manner from its meager beginning in 1888 as Bannock Stake Academy to present day BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; It certainly is a tree with good and strong roots, ready to give nourishment to the young and tender branches that are grafted to it.&nbsp;<strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as we study Zenos' teaching a good tree does not always promise the result of good fruit.&nbsp; We learn that the Lord has no control of the type of fruit the branches will bring forth.&nbsp; He patiently awaits, and allows our agency to determine the fruit we produce.&nbsp; But, what determines the type of fruit we as branches will produce?&nbsp;<br /><br />In verse 18, we learn that those branches who produced good fruit like unto the natural fruit, had "taken hold of the moisture of the root thereof, that the root thereof hath brought forth much strength; and because of the much strength of the root thereof, even the wild branches were able to bring forth good fruit."&nbsp;<br /><br />The key is to take hold of the moisture and strength that the root offers.&nbsp; Consider all that BYU-Idaho has to offer.&nbsp; I bear my witness unto you that the offerings of BYU-Idaho are in the pattern of vineyard, they have been produced in a labor of love.&nbsp; I witness each day this love.&nbsp; The strength of the root of BYU-Idaho is the solid foundation of enduring standards and principles.&nbsp; All here could not have been admitted or employed without utilizing your agency to commit to live by a life of honor.&nbsp; Yet not all take hold of it.&nbsp; We vary in obedience and personal integrity.&nbsp; So how does one take hold? It is by love.&nbsp; Just being here and being compliant is not enough, when one gains a love and gratitude for the standards they will take hold of the moisture and will begin to flourish. The true beauty of this olive tree and bounties of its harvest are dependent upon unified individual love based obedience, sacrifice, and service.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I invite you to read and ponder this great teaching with new eyes and a new heart by likening it unto yourself.&nbsp; Discover the Lord's personal love in grafting you to this tree.&nbsp; Determine the type of fruit you desire to produce.&nbsp; Assess whether you have taken hold of the moisture of the root by evaluating your love and gratitude for the standards and your personal integrity in being "true at all time".&nbsp; We employees should search our role as servants, in nurturing, pruning, digging, dunging, keeping balance in growth, and other labors of love described in this teaching.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recall again the question asked by the Savior to Peter, "Lovest thou me?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Peter learned the painful reality that his love was not yet as deep and determined as he supposed, as the cock's crow testified of his fear of man, and sent him off weeping, but most importantly initiated a conviction to love the Lord by feeding his sheep.&nbsp;<br /><br />We like Peter, should feel that piercing question of the Lord in all of our actions, "Lovest thou me?&nbsp; Our baptismal covenant to "remember him always" will assist us in keeping this self-evaluating and guiding question constantly in our hearts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Everything we do demonstrates measurable Godly love, Godly submission, and Godly sacrifice.&nbsp; Throughout my years at BYU-Idaho, and now as your Dean of Students, there is not a semester gone by that I don't hear comments like, "Why do we have curfew? What's wrong with wearing shorts? Why are flip flops evil? We can have a temple recommend, yet we can't have an endorsement. Why don't let us be free and act for ourselves?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, please understand, I know there are for every one of these comments there are three others who understand and really get it.&nbsp; However, for those who linger in the "zones of ignorance, hypocrisy, or rebellion", or for those who comply for duty's sake, I hope you will consider this.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is true that such things as staying out until 12:30 a.m., sporting a beard while off-track, and or wearing shorts while crossing campus are not inherently wrong.&nbsp; However, not being honest with our commitments, breaking covenants, and lacking a "broken heart and contrite spirit", will narrow heaven's gate.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />These seemingly small standards become an essential training ground for the development of a salvation required character.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's return to the olive tree allegory one more time.&nbsp; The Lord whenever he speaks of the purpose of His vineyard, we read the phrase "lay up fruit against the season, unto my own self."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Consider for a moment, your fruit of obedience, sacrifice, and service here at BYU-Idaho is not so much about the here and now, but to "lay up fruit against the season".&nbsp; In other words, learning to obey and sacrifice upon a foundation of love and willful submission is stored fruit for a future season.&nbsp; When we figure this out and really get it, we discover to truly love God means we seek His will and then do whatever we can to do His will.&nbsp; We then prepare ourselves for a much needed automated response when we face adversity, trials, and required tests of this mortality.&nbsp;<br /><br />Whether an affliction is consecrated or contaminated is dependent on our heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin taught, "Seek to understand and obey, because "this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. When we love the Lord, obedience ceases to be a burden. Obedience becomes a delight. When we love the Lord, we seek less for things that benefit us and turn our hearts toward things that will bless and uplift others." (Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, "The Great Commandment", Ensign, November 2007&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">Today's planted seeds of love based obedience and sacrifice will be fruits of life and light in the future<br /></strong>President Ezra Taft Benson said, "<em>The great test of life</em>&nbsp;is obedience to God.&nbsp;<em>The great task of life</em>&nbsp;is to learn the will of the Lord and then do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The great commandment of life</em>&nbsp;is to love the Lord." (President Ezra Taft Benson, "The Great Commandment - Love the Lord" Ensign, May, 1988)<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I have felt impressed to share a personal witness of how life's greatest test, task and commandment blend together to bless and develop us.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />On Saturday, December 20, 2008, it was a busy day in the Miyasaki home.&nbsp; My wife helped with the finishing touches of our local High School's Operation Merry Christmas.&nbsp; We then cooked breakfast for the basketball team, and after running several more errands, she was getting ready to go score keep at the upcoming basketball games when she complained of chest pains.&nbsp; I deducted it was probably just her fast paced morning, and instructed her to just lie down and rest for a bit.&nbsp; My daughter came and told me that the pain still persisted and I called my sister, a nurse for counsel.&nbsp; She suggested I take her to the Community Care Center for examination.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way to Rexburg from our home in Sugar City, my wife said in a tearful voice, "I'm too young to die".&nbsp; I scolded her for even thinking that she would die, but little did I know, that in less than one minute, she would state, "I feel like I'm going to faint", and then she went into cardiac arrest.&nbsp; As she went limp, I reached over and placed one hand on her head, offering a short priesthood blessing.&nbsp; I maneuvered my way to the hospital, steering with one arm down the center of the road, and with my other arm headlocking my sweetheart's limp body to keep her upright, until we arrived at the Emergency Room.&nbsp; I ran in and shouted, my wife is not breathing, and quickly the medical personnel rushed her to the emergency room.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I heard the overhead address system call out repeatedly, "Code Blue, Emergency Room".&nbsp; I watched the flat line on the heart monitor, fear overcame me and I called my daughter to tell the family their mother was not breathing nor had a heartbeat.&nbsp; Just as I hung up the phone, in the next miraculous moment, they revived her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />She was transferred to the hospital in Idaho Falls underwent successful surgery, but still unconscious, the physicians warned me that they did not know how much damage was left by the minutes she was without oxygen before she was brought back to life.&nbsp; For 24 hours they reduced her body temperature to the high 80's to keep the swelling in her brain to a minimum.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I recall sitting by her side during that time, holding her cold hand, wondering what might our future be.&nbsp; Would she be less than what she had been?&nbsp; Would she be able to walk, talk, and think?&nbsp; How would our life now be changed?&nbsp;<br /><br />I remember wondering what I should pray for.&nbsp; A blessing was given, could I pray for more than what she was blessed?&nbsp; What was the will of the Father? Did He want her to be here or did He need her in the next life?&nbsp; Or if she were to survive and be less than normal, did God desire me to live a life of serving my sweetheart?&nbsp;<br /><br />On Monday morning, some 40 hours since hearing those words, "I'm too young to die", my Darla opened her eyes.&nbsp; During the next two days, she showed remarkable progress, and it looked as if all was well and normal.&nbsp; She was talking, walking, eating, making jokes, and began stating her worries.&nbsp; The doctors were enthused, and reported Darla would be moved to the rehab floor on Wednesday, which meant we were close to release, possibly on Christmas day.&nbsp; It was now Tuesday night, and after the visitors and family all left, Darla and I were alone in the room, holding hands, I offered a prayer of thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />After the prayer, Darla asked me, "Why did this happen to me?"&nbsp;<br /><br />I responded, "Probably to learn some important lessons."&nbsp;<br /><br />After a moment, Darla said, "I don't know of any lessons I have learned," then she asked, "what have you learned?"&nbsp;<br /><br />I then rehearsed to her many lessons that I had learned, but one of the great lessons I rehearsed was from the teachings of Paul found in Ephesians 5:25: "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church."&nbsp;<br /><br />My discovery that night, was the answer to the question, "how do we take hold of the good root?"&nbsp;<br /><br />We do it by following the example of our Savior.&nbsp; We taste of the sweetness of the blessings of the atonement when we abide by his invitation of &nbsp;"...that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do" (3 Nephi 27:21)&nbsp;<br /><br />President Uchtdorf taught, "When we truly understand what it means to love as Jesus Christ loves us, the confusion clears and our priorities align. Our walk as disciples of Christ becomes more joyful. Our lives take on new meaning. Our relationship with our Heavenly Father becomes more profound. Obedience becomes a joy rather than a burden." (President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "The Love of God", Ensign, November, 2009)&nbsp;<br /><br />During the night after that sacred conversation, my Sweetheart suffered a severe stroke.&nbsp; The doctors after examining the MRI results reported that the bleeding in her brain was so severe, that Darla had lost her ability to speak, think, and be mobile.&nbsp; They posed a possible surgical intervention that at best preserve a vegetative state, but even at that stated her chance to survive the surgery was 50/50.&nbsp; Without surgery, they speculated she would die within&nbsp;a few hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As patriarch, I gathered our family into a hospital room.&nbsp; There I announced to them the state of my wife, their mother, their sister, and grandmother.&nbsp; The scene was heart wrenching.&nbsp; We had to make a quick decision.&nbsp; Should it be surgery with the best possible results a vegetative state, or let fate take its course and have Darla with us only a few more hours.&nbsp; A beautiful, heart searching family prayer was offered by my son, Jared, and the will of the Lord was revealed.&nbsp; Darla's mortal mission was complete, and we must submit to the will of the Father.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and Sisters, submission to the Father's will in all things is a pattern of love.&nbsp; It is the essential characteristic of the atonement and receiving the blessings of the atonement.&nbsp; It shows we trust in Him, that we love Him most, and in turn we can love others best.&nbsp; He then can bless us in ways that we cannot see nor comprehend.&nbsp; We then can produce fruit that we and He can lay up against the season.&nbsp;<br /><br />Six days had now passed since we made the decision, and Darla was in an unconscious state throughout this time, her body hanging on to mortality, but day by day growing closer to death.&nbsp; On this sixth night, we had a dinner of take out Chinese food, which of course included the fortune cookies.&nbsp; We joked about how lame the messages of fortune had become, my message echoed this as it read, "the evening promises romantic interests".&nbsp; We all shared a laugh about my untimely message of fortune.&nbsp; For when one envisions romance, certain images appear of a night out, possibly going to a nice dinner, having wonderful caring conversations, and then cuddling and loving each other.&nbsp; That was certainly not in my cards that night.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I discovered that night what true romance really is.&nbsp; That last night of being together in this mortality was filled with pure love and romance.&nbsp; After my family had left, and it was just my sweetheart and I in the hospital room, I told my unconscious Darla that this would most likely be our last night together.&nbsp; I shared with her that I was ready to let her go and asked if she was ready.&nbsp; I noticed her eyes twitching, something that I had not seen for a week.&nbsp; I asked her if she could to respond by squinting her eyes once for yes and twice for no.&nbsp; She responded with a squint.&nbsp; It was evident her spirit was alive and was able to communicate with me.&nbsp; She responded that she was also ready to go on.&nbsp;<br /><br />We then started the night with a prayer.&nbsp; I then read scriptures to her from sections 130, 132, and 138 from the Doctrine and Covenants, Alma 7, 42, and 43, and from the 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;book of Ephesians.&nbsp; I shared with her my testimony and lessons I had learned from each of those scriptures.&nbsp; We prayed again.&nbsp; During the time in the hospital, I tried very hard not to counsel the Lord, and not ask for things that were contrary to His will.&nbsp; I tried to really pray in the name of Christ, and to have the mind of Christ.&nbsp; That night as we prayed, I felt the feeling that anything I asked that night would be granted, and so I offered my sweetheart, pure, clean, and ready for service in the next life.&nbsp; I then laid my hands on my eternal companion's head and gave her the last priesthood blessing in this mortality.&nbsp; Then, after this most beautiful night, positioning chairs so I could lay down next to Darla, we then held hands the remainder of the night, all night long.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />That, my friends, was truly a night of romance and pure love.&nbsp; Not a penny was spent, there was no fancy dressing up, no expensive dinners, not one dependency on outside entertainment.&nbsp; Yet, our spirits were molded into one, our hearts were bound, we were one in purpose though soon our paths would be temporarily separated, never would our eternal destiny differ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As I went through this ordeal, there was nothing more I desired than for my sweetheart to live.&nbsp; We had a future with plans of serving in the temple, going on missions, and enjoying our family.&nbsp; Because of loving God first, I was able to love my Sweetheart the best.&nbsp; Because of submitting our will to the will of the Lord, we were blessed with so many miracles and continue to be blessed.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior showed the way of how to love the Father the best.&nbsp; He always knew the Father's will and He always submitted to His will.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In understanding the "pure love of Christ" Moroni instructs us what we should do: "pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ; that they may become sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure..." (Moroni 7:48)&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of our lives is a minute by minute opportunity to show our answer to the question, "Lovest thou me". My testimony is that your experience here at BYU-Idaho is a training ground for learning to love the Lord first and foremost, and to learn to sacrifice your individual will to make way for the will of the Father.&nbsp; By learning this now, you will be armed with stored fruit of personal integrity that will be much needed in the storms ahead.&nbsp; God lives and loves you. Our Savior's atonement is real and ready for us to take hold.&nbsp; This is my testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Sister Jensen and I are so very pleased to be here today to honor you who are graduating.&nbsp; At the same time we honor your parents and family, the administration, the faculty, and the staff.&nbsp; These wonderful people and your efforts make your graduation possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is power in quoting the words of the Latter-day prophets and apostles. President Boyd K. Packer&rsquo;s illustration of the parable of the pearl and the box is cited often in our messages and training. The context for it is the dedication of the Church&rsquo;s magnificent Conference Center in Salt Lake City ten short years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it possible for those of us who are called upon to speak to draw attention away from this wonderful building long enough to focus on the purpose for which it was built?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it can be done with a parable and a poem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parable: A merchant man seeking precious jewels found at last the perfect pearl. He had the finest craftsman carve a superb jewel box and line it with blue velvet. He put his pearl of great price on display so others could share his treasure. He watched as people came to see it. Soon he turned away in sorrow. It was the box they admired, not the pearl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poem:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are all blind, until we see</em> <br /><em>That in the [universal] plan</em> <br /><em>Nothing is worth the making if</em> <br /><em>It does not make the man.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Why build these [buildings] glorious,</em> <br /><em>If man unbuilded goes?</em> <br /><em>In vain we build the [world], unless</em> <br /><em>The builder also grows.&rdquo; </em>(&ldquo;The Cloven Tongues of Fire,&rdquo; <em>Ensign</em>, May 2000, p. 7).</p>
<p>The parable and the poem are uniquely applicable to these graduation exercises today. I believe that the beautifully printed graduation certificate, made of quality paper and placed carefully in a folder, is the box. You and all that you have in you&mdash;your skills, your knowledge, your eternal spirit&mdash; are the precious pearl. Paraphrasing President Packer, if we can draw your attention away from your diploma, we are here today to honor you, &ldquo;the builders who have grown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first two verses from the book of Abraham are remarkably relevant for our commencement services today. Abraham said that &ldquo;it was needful for [him] to obtain another place of residence&rdquo; (Abraham 1:1). For Abraham that change of residence was motivated by his desire to seek the blessings of his fathers, the righteous patriarchs from Adam to his day. Note these relevant phrases: &ldquo;I sought for the blessings of the fathers&hellip;desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge and to be a greater follower of righteousness, to possess a greater knowledge&hellip;and desiring to receive instructions, and to keep the commandments of God, I became a rightful heir&rdquo; (Abraham 1:1-2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Abraham, most of you have obtained another place of residence and will likely do so again in the coming months motivated by your desires to obtain the blessings of your fathers and to obtain or possess greater knowledge. Today I wish to focus on becoming a rightful heir to the blessings of the fathers, your own fathers as well as the Old Testament prophets and patriarchs. I emphasize five truths, each a pearl of great price:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Becoming an heir to faith and testimony</strong></p>
<p>As with earlier generations, there is a variety among young adults in their spiritual strength and testimony. That you are seated here today is evidence that you are strong in your faith and testimony of the Father and the Son and Their restored gospel. However, this is also an age when doubts may enter and the creep of worldliness penetrates so subtly into some, resulting in a loss of faith and testimony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found that my faith and testimony of the doctrines and principles of the Restored Gospel came first during my childhood with a testimony of faith&mdash;faith in the words, the testimony, and the examples of parents, teachers, and leaders. Next it came intellectually as a missionary. I immersed myself in the scriptures, especially in the Book of Mormon, and found a symphony of divine doctrine&mdash;so logical, and so satisfying. Third, the testimony of experience&mdash;experiences such as answers to prayer, priesthood blessings, payment of tithes and offerings, and fourth, the absolute assurances witnessed by the Holy Ghost, revelations that came directly to my mind and my heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Jensen and I dated in high school and graduated together in 1960. In January 1961, we decided to marry and that I would not serve a mission.&nbsp; We attended sacrament meetings together, either her ward in Springville or mine in Mapleton. In mid-January we attended my ward and listened to a returned missionary report on his mission to Mexico. Following that meeting, I turned to Lonie and said, &ldquo;We have made a mistake. I want to serve a mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I experienced what President Hinckley described from his mission to England: &ldquo;Something happened inside me in England that was so significant and deep-rooted that I have never gotten over it. It is the same thing I have seen happen to thousands of other young men and women who commit themselves to the Lord, and their faith in Him becomes their anchor. Everything good that has happened to me is a result of what happened while I served in that land&rdquo; (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</span>, p. 64).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Jensen said she would wait for me, and as you can see, she did; although during the mission I did detect some apostasy on her part when I learned that she was dating another man. A few well-worded letters from me had their desired effect. I am thankful she listened. We married in the Manti Temple 33 days after I returned home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the mission I made conscious decisions to ensure I would become an heir to faith and testimony. I group these</p>
<p>Commitments into daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly goals. They continue to bless my life and our marriage and family.</p>
<p>Daily:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the sacrament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is done at two-year intervals.</p>
<p>Sometimes we say that there are great people in this Church. In a way this is correct; however, I believe it is more accurate to say that we have ordinary people who consistently do great things. Always do the things that lead you to become an heir to faith and testimony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Becoming an heir to a life of service</strong></p>
<p>Your generation may be known as the &ldquo;validation generation.&rdquo; You have grown up with constant feedback from parents, teachers, peers, and others, generally validating your worth and importance. This is often done today through social networking including texting, twitter, Facebook, e-mails, telephone, and other. All of this suggests friendship and a means to reduce isolation and loneliness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young single adults are generally perceived as a very mobile group. Whether you attend Young Single Adult or conventional wards, we urge you to stay connected to your spiritual roots through a judge in Israel, a bishop. One of his purposes is to safeguard your worthy access to the ordinances of the Church, including the sacrament, priesthood advancements, and temple blessings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accept Church callings and participate in activities, Sabbath classes, and Institutes of Religion. Lose yourself in the service of others, such as temples, Family History centers, and community programs. We urge you to become an heir to a life of service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Becoming an heir to moral purity</strong></p>
<p>Concerning morals and a morally polluted environment, the Apostle Paul described our day: &ldquo;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter-times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron&rdquo; (1 Timothy 4:1-2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These prophetic views describe the evils of degrading television, movies, and music, some of which is explained away with this deceptive comment, &ldquo;It was really good except for&hellip;.&rdquo; Powerful, pervasive, and persistent is the plague of pornography. It is an addiction as serious in magnitude and scope as an addiction to drugs, alcohol, or tobacco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our society has more leisure time than perhaps any other society in history. This is manifest sometimes with a preoccupation for sports and entertainment along with inordinate amounts of time on video games or the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To truly become an heir to moral purity requires us to put on the whole armor of God, which is found in the ordinances and covenants of the restored gospel.&nbsp; To worthily partake of the sacrament each week ensures you are an heir to moral purity and you are on the path to eternal life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Becoming an heir to temporal self-reliance</strong></p>
<p>Education is vital for both men and women. Abraham said he desired &ldquo;to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge...desiring to receive instructions&rdquo; (Abraham 1:2).&nbsp; Citing the words of the Savior, &ldquo;you have put your hand to the plow&rdquo; and you are not looking back, for when you look back, as Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, you are holding back (Luke 9:62).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have your hand firmly on the plow of higher education, which parallels the university&rsquo;s purpose statement to &ldquo;prepare students for lifelong learning, for employment, and for their roles as citizens and parents.&rdquo; I commend the administration and faculty of this extraordinary university for the appropriate emphasis on lifelong learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At BYU-Idaho you have been at the center of a learning process involving teachers, others, and yourself. Here you have had experiences beyond repeating information back to teachers. You captured information under the direction of a teacher, expanded or changed it for your purposes, and then used what you learned to bless others. This may be summarized with this truth, <em>we teach to learn</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A mentor in my life instilled in me as a young seminary teacher this governing principle&mdash; &ldquo;Keep a growing edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this fast-paced world there is so much to learn. Always read, study, and ponder the scriptures and the words of the prophets, ancient and modern, but beyond this keep a balance by reading other good books and publications. Read, study, mark, capture, expand, digest, assemble, clip, cut, paste, file, and organize what you are learning. Visit, travel, observe, listen, ponder, question, analyze, synthesize, and then teach what you have learned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, &ldquo;God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost&rdquo; D&amp;C 121:26).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this educational foundation of learning and teaching and keeping a growing edge, you now embark on a journey leading to employment, stability, and temporal self-reliance. This pathway is not free of obstacles. Compared to our generation of 50 years ago&mdash; who graduated from high school, served a mission, married our high school sweetheart, found employment, and settled down to raise a family&mdash;you are more likely to come home from your mission, spend a number of years getting more education and training, and prepare for careers. This includes an increasing number of young women who pursue a career instead of homemaking because opportunities to marry do not come or are being postponed.&nbsp; We encourage you to follow the faith of your fathers and not postpone marriage, which is a prophetic priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prophets and apostles teach us to establish our priorities on a gospel foundation for &ldquo;when your priorities are out of order you lose power.&rdquo; When they are in order you obtain power. These priorities are to build on the rock of our Redeemer, a sure foundation to withstand the temptations of Satan. His teachings are to become self-reliant through suitable occupation or self-employment so as to provide for your own and your families&rsquo; needs. Be skilled, diligent, trustworthy, and give honest work for the pay and benefits you receive.&nbsp; Pay tithes and offerings and avoid unnecessary debt. Do not follow the worldly thinking to obtain &ldquo;things&rdquo; by borrowing now and paying later. Use a budget and live within a plan. Save for a rainy day (see <em>Providing in the Lord&rsquo;s Way</em>, pp. 1-2). Have faith, faith in God and His Son and Their eternal promises as you become an heir to temporal self-reliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Becoming an heir to the Abrahamic covenant</strong></p>
<p>Becoming an heir to the Abrahamic covenant in its fullness is marriage for time and eternity. A central purpose of the temple is &ldquo;that they may grow up in thee, and receive a fullness of the Holy Ghost, and be organized according to thy laws&rdquo; (D&amp;C 109:15). Every temple marriage is being organized according to His laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The adversary opposes marriage and family. He fosters disorganization. Divorce, same gender attractions, abortion, and adultery are typical of his efforts. Apostles today have spoken in favor of the &ldquo;dating culture&rdquo; and have spoken against the &ldquo;hang out&rdquo; culture resulting in postponing marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage is ordained of God&rdquo; (see &ldquo;The Family&mdash;A Proclamation to the World&rdquo;). It is a high priority for all able LDS young adults. The sealing ordinance, along with the covenants we make, is the pearl and a temple is a magnificent box. &ldquo;Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; (ibid).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bearing and rearing of children is a primary purpose of marriage. Lehi taught &ldquo;that his sons should take daughters to wife, that they may raise up seed unto the Lord&rdquo; (1 Nephi 7:2). The only scripture reference cited in &ldquo;The Family&mdash;a Proclamation to the World&rdquo; is &ldquo;Children are an heritage of the Lord.&rdquo; It goes on to say that children are like arrows in the hand of a mighty man&mdash; and, I add, a woman&mdash; and &ldquo;happy [are] the man [and the woman] that hath [their] quiver full of them&rdquo; (Psalm 127:3-5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarize our fervent prayer is that you will become rightful heirs to the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, including faith and a testimony of the Father and the Son and this holy work, a lifetime of service, moral purity, spiritual and temporal self-reliance coming from honorable employment and income to meet your needs, and a marriage in the holy temple and children to follow to whom you will pass on this heritage as rightful heirs to the blessings of the fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attended a meeting for religious educators in September 1978 in which then Elder Gordon B. Hinckley of the Quorum of the Twelve spoke. I shall never forget his concluding message, a clipping he found from the <em>Deseret News</em>, which I quote to conclude my message:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone who imagines that bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that he&rsquo;s been robbed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most putts don&rsquo;t drop. Most beef is tough. Most children grow up to be just people. Most successful marriages require a high degree of toleration. Most jobs are more often dull than otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is like an old-time rail journey&mdash;delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders, and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride&rdquo; (Gordon B. Hinckley, &ldquo;<em>Four Imperatives for Religious Educators</em>,&rdquo; Meeting of Religious Educators, September 15, 1978, p. 4).</p>
<p>When the Savior appeared to the people in the Americas He said, &ldquo;And behold, ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the [families] of the earth be blessed&rdquo; (3 Nephi 20:25). You are becoming rightful heirs of the blessings of the fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I witness to you that God lives, He is our Father, and we are His spirit offspring. Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world, and through Him we may be made clean through the infinite Atonement. The Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith. I bear witness that the Book of Mormon is true. Thomas S. Monson is a true prophet of the Living God and he, his counselors, and the Twelve Apostles are all prophets, seers, and revelators holding all the keys of the kingdom. I pray that you will be blessed and magnified to become a rightful heir; in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<span id="_marker">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Graduation represents one of those grand pivotal points in your lives.&nbsp; This moment in time provides a unique and exciting perspective: looking forward with great anticipation (or even some anxiety) at what now lies ahead of you, as well as an opportunity for contemplating lessons learned while reflecting on and remembering what you have learned in the past.&nbsp; Hopefully, each of you will leave BYU-Idaho with wonderful memories of the many different relationships, interactions, and stretching opportunities (academically, spiritually, physically, and socially) you have experienced.&nbsp; Looking forward while also looking backward allows you to build upon what and who you are, to become who and what you are to be.&nbsp; Remembering is an important element of becoming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball taught that &ldquo;remember&rdquo; may be the most important word in our language.&nbsp; He stated: &ldquo;When you look in the dictionary for the most important word, do you know what it is?&nbsp; It could be &lsquo;remember.&rsquo;&nbsp; Because all of [us] have made covenants&hellip;our greatest need is to remember&hellip;&rsquo;Remember&rsquo; is the word&rdquo; (Kimball, 1968, p. 8).&nbsp; There are over 350 scriptural references admonishing us, in one form or another, to remember.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my favorite scriptures on remembering comes from Alma&rsquo;s counsel to his son Helaman: &ldquo;O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God&rdquo; (Alma 37:35).&nbsp; The brain has a remarkable capacity to remember all kinds of things; however, some things are more important to remember than others.&nbsp; Learning to keep the commandments of God is fundamental.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to enhance our ability to remember, disciplined study patterns should be developed.&nbsp; Establishing an appropriate study environment is also essential to learning, whether it be at home, at school, at work, or in your personal spiritual devotions.&nbsp; Being able to find or create such an environment may be challenging at times, but the benefits are well worth the effort in helping you to remember.&nbsp; Most of you probably figured out as a student that staying in your dorm room or apartment was not one of the most effective or efficient places to study for school, largely due to the &ldquo;energetic sociality&rdquo; that often surrounds that setting.&nbsp; You generally resorted to the library, the lab, a practice room, or a focused study group to get the most out of your study time in hopes of remembering critical information when it came time for regular exams, midterms, or finals. &nbsp;Hopefully, you also learned another valuable lesson: that last-minute &ldquo;cramming&rdquo; was not the most effective way to help you to remember.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The learning environment at BYU-Idaho is unique among universities.&nbsp; It is conducive not only to learning, but also to living the gospel.&nbsp; It is a place where you have been nurtured and strengthened by the Spirit.&nbsp; Wherever you go throughout the balance of your life, the knowledge you have gained will serve you well and the memories of your experiences here will hold a special place in your heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For many of you, this BYU-Idaho experience represents the pinnacle of your formal academic pursuits.&nbsp; However, don&rsquo;t let it be the end of your learning experiences.&nbsp; The more you learn &ldquo;of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms,&rdquo; as stated in the Doctrine and Covenants (D&amp;C 88:79), you will continually marvel at the knowledge and majesty of God and His creations, and in the process, you will be prepared to be of greater service in His kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another learning environment has been created for us by the Lord himself.&nbsp; It has been referred to at times by some of the Brethren as &ldquo;the University of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am referring, of course, to the temple. Entering the House of the Lord is a privilege for those who qualify and an exquisite environment for spiritual learning for those who seek, ask, and knock.&nbsp; President Boyd K. Packer stated: &ldquo;The temple is a great school. It is a house of learning.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continues: &ldquo;In the temples the atmosphere is maintained so that it is ideal for instruction on matters that are deeply spiritual&hellip;If you will go to the temple and remember that the teaching is symbolic you will never go <em>in the proper spirit</em> without coming away with your vision extended, feeling a little more exalted, with your knowledge increased as to things that are spiritual.&rdquo;&nbsp; Likewise, he observed: &ldquo;The temple itself becomes a symbol. [As] you have seen one of the temples at night, fully lighted, you know what an impressive sight that can be. The house of the Lord, bathed in light, standing out in the darkness, becomes symbolic of the power and the inspiration of the gospel of Jesus Christ standing as a beacon in a world that sinks ever further into spiritual darkness&rdquo; (<em>Ensign</em>, 1995, 32-36).&nbsp; The temple is a place to learn more about the Lord&rsquo;s plan of happiness; the nature of eternity; and the nature of who you really are and your relationship to God.&nbsp; It is a place of learning that is, or should become, integral to your lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important learning environment established and endorsed by the Lord is the home and family.&nbsp; The culmination of all learning should be for the purpose of blessing your home environment.&nbsp; If you were to &ldquo;liken the scriptures&rdquo; (1 Nephi 19:25) unto yourselves and extend the counsel of the Lord regarding the purpose of temples to your own home, you would find valuable instruction: &ldquo;&hellip;establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God&rdquo; (D&amp;C 88:119).&nbsp; By creating such a house, you can establish the kind of environment and be entitled to the kind of blessings described by Joseph in the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple.&nbsp; The home environment should be such &ldquo;that no unclean thing&hellip;shall be permitted to come into thy house to pollute it&hellip;that all people who shall enter upon the threshold&hellip;may feel [God&rsquo;s] power, and feel constrained to acknowledge that [He has] sanctified it&rdquo; and that those of your family &ldquo;may seek learning even by study, and also by faith&rdquo; (D&amp;C 109:20, 13-14).&nbsp; The promised blessings for such a house are that those who dwell there &ldquo;may go forth&hellip;armed with&hellip;thy power, and that thy name be upon them, and thy glory be round about them, and thine angels have charge over them; and from this place they may bear exceedingly great and glorious tidings, in truth&rdquo; (D&amp;C 109:22-23). &nbsp;Your home can be a refuge from the storm, a spiritual light in an ever-darkening world, and a sanctuary for all those who seek shelter from the vicissitudes of life.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul said to Timothy, &ldquo;&hellip;in the last days perilous time shall come.&nbsp; For men shall be&hellip;ever learning, and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth&rdquo; (2 Timothy 3:1-2, 7).&nbsp; The Lord knew that many of His children would lack faith, especially in the last days.&nbsp; You have had the unique privilege to study at an institution that has helped to foster your faith, has increased your knowledge, and has provided memorable learning experiences for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you now leave this university and go out into the world, continue to live your life so that you may be an example of faith and a witness for truth &ldquo;at all times and in all things, and in all places&rdquo; (Mosiah: 18:9).&nbsp; Continue to create special learning environments where you can ponder new ideas and engage in important, uplifting, and insightful conversations. &nbsp;But most importantly, continue to create an environment where you can let the doctrines of the gospel &ldquo;distill upon thy soul as the dews from heaven&rdquo; (D&amp;C 121:45), where you can contemplate the mission, the ministry, the majesty, and the mysteries of God.&nbsp; Remember, the more you learn about God, about yourself, and about your relationship with Him, will influence not only the direction you go, but also your final destination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did you know that this wonderful facility we find ourselves in today was completed in November of 1969 and was soon thereafter dedicated by Elder Delbert L. Stapley of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since that time there have been hundreds of devotionals and firesides conducted within these walls where inspired men and women; many of them General Authorities and officers of the Church, have spoken.&nbsp; When I think of this history and the hands that have touched this podium and the words that have been broadcast to thousands from this microphone over the 40 plus year history of this building, I am humbled and grateful to be numbered among them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While at some risk, I feel it safe to suggest to you that each of the speakers that have or will ever occupy this position, that I am so honored to occupy now, have but one goal in heart and mind; that of your personal instruction and edification.&nbsp; We are here for you.&nbsp; We want this to be a meaningful experience for you.&nbsp; We want you to know that you are loved and that you inspire in us great faith and hope for the future.&nbsp; We trust that your goodness will help shape a better world for us all.&nbsp; Indeed, this is your charge as a Disciple of Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, we express words like those of the Apostle Paul writing to the Thessalonians; &ldquo;We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers&rdquo;.&nbsp; You are a remarkable sight to behold and we are grateful for your presence here today and your presence here at Brigham Young University-Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I acknowledge my dear wife and son, Sam, who are with me today.&nbsp; I also acknowledge and thank the many leaders who are here on the stand with us.&nbsp; I especially want to make mention of President and Sister Clark.&nbsp; I love and appreciate my association and friendship with these two remarkable people.&nbsp; How blessed you are to be under their watchful care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This fireside has been referenced as the &ldquo;Get Connected&rdquo; fireside and is one of a series of events designed to help you become better acquainted with the University and to help you take full advantage of the opportunities that are here for you.&nbsp; Accordingly, I wish to title my remarks &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Getting Connected.</span>&rdquo; I have given much thought to this opportunity I have been given to address you today.&nbsp; I have sought to know the Lord&rsquo;s will and feel that the topic I have prepared is what He would have me say.&nbsp; I pray now to be able to say it in a spirit that will allow for our edification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To introduce this topic, I wish to share a personal experience.&nbsp; When I was 16-years old, I was invited to experience my first flight in an airplane.&nbsp; What made this event even more exciting was the fact that the invitation was extended to me by a beautiful girl that I would later marry.&nbsp; Her father was co-owner of a small, single-engine, Cessna airplane.&nbsp; The day of the flight, we met at the American Falls airport just west of my home in Pocatello, Idaho.&nbsp; I was invited to sit up front in what could be described as the co-pilot&rsquo;s seat.&nbsp; I was thrilled as I would be given the opportunity to take the controls of the plane once we had achieved our flight altitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon after take-off, the plane ride quickly went from thrilling to terrifying.&nbsp; The plane began a series of unexplainable acrobatic motions.&nbsp; I became disoriented and did not know up from down.&nbsp; At first I thought the pilot was just trying to spook us a bit with sharp turns and steep dives.&nbsp; However, before things could become clear to me, I felt a tremendous thrust forward as the plane hit the ground and I blacked out.&nbsp; My first airplane experience had ended in a crash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incident of our plane crash was investigated.&nbsp; It was determined that we lost power to the engine due to a malfunction of the magneto switch.&nbsp; I have since learned that the magneto switch is that critical connection that gives the electrical spark, and therefore life, to the engine.&nbsp; Without it there is no power and without power there is no way to keep the plane in the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While gratefully, all of us were able to walk away from this crash with minor injury, I learned something very valuable from this experience.&nbsp; Something that has been reinforced throughout my life and that is; there exists a power source for each one of us.&nbsp; This power source is our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; Getting connected to this power source helps us to find flight in life, or happiness and success.&nbsp; We have the capacity to develop and maintain a continuous connection to this power source through prayer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prayer is a familiar principle and a wonderful blessing available to us all.&nbsp; It is one of the first principles we teach and practice with children in the home.&nbsp; It is typically the first act of public worship a child attempts while attending Primary.&nbsp; It is included in the first lesson taught by the Missionaries to those investigating the Church.&nbsp; It is referenced by word or theme so often throughout all of the books of scripture that no one can mistake its importance in the mind of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important because our Heavenly Father wants us to know that we are His children.&nbsp; That He loves us.&nbsp; That He knows our needs.&nbsp; He wants to bless us.&nbsp; He wants us to be happy.&nbsp; He wants us to know His plan for us and that part of that plan requires a mortal existence where we are temporarily separated from Him.&nbsp; Prayer is the means by which we communicate with our Father during this period of separation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is how we come to know Him; and, conversely, it is how we come to know who we are.&nbsp; It not only becomes our source of power, but our source of guidance, knowledge, endurance, confidence, protection, forgiveness, and faith.&nbsp; It is no wonder then that we have been commanded to pray.&nbsp; In modern revelation the Savior taught; &ldquo;And again, I command thee that thou shalt pray vocally as well as in thy heart; yea, before the world as well as in secret, in public as well as in private&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also been commanded to pray always.&nbsp; To the ancient inhabitants of the American continent that Savior taught; &ldquo;Therefore, ye must always pray unto the Father in my name&rdquo;.&nbsp; And again by way of modern revelation; &ldquo;Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing &ndash; yea, even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth and corruptibleness to the extent thereof&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To pray always requires that each day we find time to kneel in humble prayer to the Father.&nbsp; At other times during the day it is appropriate to &ldquo;go with a prayer in our hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this way we maintain the perpetual connection to our source of power and blessing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fulfill the commandment to pray always and to claim the blessings of prayer, we must strive to make prayer a part of our lives and learn basic principles that empower our capacity to pray with greater intent.&nbsp; The principles I wish to speak to you about today are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Principles of Prayer</span></p>
<p>First, the <strong>pattern of prayer</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggesting that there is a pattern to prayer is to suggest that there is a model, an ideal to which we ought to strive if we want our prayers to penetrate the heavens.&nbsp; The ultimate pattern for us was demonstrated by the Savior in His Sermon on the Mount.&nbsp; Here he taught His disciples how to pray by offering to them an example of prayer which has come to be known as the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.&nbsp; Listen, and attempt to discern elements to the pattern of prayer taught by the Savior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed by thy name.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy kingdom come.&nbsp; Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.&nbsp; Amen&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice to whom He prayed.&nbsp; Notice His choice of words.&nbsp; Notice the prayer&rsquo;s simplicity and brevity.&nbsp; Notice the content, the suggestion that our will yield to the Father&rsquo;s, and the worshipful praise that is given.&nbsp; All elements to the pattern of prayer.&nbsp; Allow me, for just a moment, to enlarge on just of few of these patterned elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we are to pray to Heavenly Father and none else.&nbsp; We are to pray in the name of the Son, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; We are to use language that shows love, respect, and reverence for the Father; words such as thy, thine, thee, and thou instead of the more familiar you and yours.&nbsp; Some may wonder why this old &ldquo;biblical&rdquo; sounding language makes a difference for us today.&nbsp; The answer is given by our Church leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Joseph Fielding Smith taught:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Eternal Father and his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, should never be approached in prayer in the familiar expressions so commonly used in addressing human beings.&nbsp; The Father and the Son should always be honored in our prayers in the utmost humility and reverence&rdquo;.</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball wrote:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all our prayers, it is well to use the pronouns thee, thou, thy, and thine instead of you, your and yours inasmuch as they have come to indicate respect&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In Preach My Gospel, missionaries are taught to &ldquo;Use the language of prayer, which shows that you love and respect your Heavenly Father.&nbsp; Use proper and respectful language in whatever language you speak.&nbsp; For example, in English use scriptural pronouns such as Thee, Thou, Thy, and Thine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another pattern consistent with the Savior&rsquo;s teaching in the Sermon on the Mount is to avoid vain repetitions or, in other words, empty phrases.&nbsp; He said; &ldquo;But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two aspects of this scripture worth mentioning; that of vain repetitions and that of thinking they shall be heard for their much speaking.&nbsp; To use vain repetition is to speak from the comfort of memorized wording rather than the spontaneous manifestations of the heart.&nbsp; It is to speak without thinking, offering familiar, well-used phrases that become routine and therefore meaningless as compared to those thoughts that originate from the yearnings of the heart. &nbsp;&nbsp;In either case, the use of such empty, meaningless expression ought to be avoided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, and related to our need to avoid vain repetitions, is that of thinking we may be heard for our much speaking.&nbsp; Our prayers need not be lengthy to be effective.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A favorite saying of mine, the origins of which I do not know, is that &ldquo;a prayer does not need to be everlasting to be eternal.&rdquo;&nbsp; While time should not be a governing factor to our prayers, we should not be ashamed of the simple, heart-felt prayer that conveys our love, gratitude and interests to God with an economy of words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember as a boy the way I admired and looked up to my Grandfather Burton.&nbsp; Although separated by distance, I often had occasion to hear him pray.&nbsp; The impression left upon me still to this day is that he knew how to communicate with Heavenly Father.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t talk &ldquo;at&rdquo; Him, he spoke to Him with the expectation that the prayer would be heard and answered according to the will of the Father.&nbsp; His prayers were simple, not verbose, and yet powerful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On one occasion we knelt in our home for family prayer.&nbsp; Grandfather Burton was asked to offer the prayer by my father.&nbsp; I remember listening with intent to the words of the prayer.&nbsp; At one point I was startled by something he said.&nbsp; Grandpa thanked Heavenly Father for our &ldquo;Forbearers,&rdquo; an expression that I had not heard before.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the prayer I said, Grandpa, that was nice of you to thank Heavenly Father for the bears, but there were only three bears not four!&rdquo;&nbsp; I learned that day from a wonderful man the feelings of his heart that found expression in his prayer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I invite you to try something that may help to establish for you a more meaningful connection in prayer?&nbsp; At the end of the day, prior to your retiring for the night, take a moment to think upon the days activities and ask yourself; &ldquo;What made this day different from others I have experienced?&nbsp; Did I make a new friend?&nbsp; Did I learn something new?&nbsp; Was I given a new challenge to overcome?&nbsp; Was I the recipient of someone else&rsquo;s kindness?&nbsp; Did I serve someone in need?&nbsp; Did I have a spiritual experience or act upon spiritual promptings as I felt directed to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The setting can be reversed and the questions modified for the beginning of the day as well.&nbsp; The point is to take time in quiet reflection, prior to offering prayer, to think about what has or what may occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you ponder the answer to these questions you will find the welcoming attitude of prayer overcome your being.&nbsp; You will be drawn to your knees and you will be given the words to speak.&nbsp; In that moment you will find the language of reverence coming to you naturally.&nbsp; There will be no vain repetitions.&nbsp; There will be no urgency to finish quick or extend long.&nbsp; There will only be you and your Father in communication one with another.&nbsp; There will be an outpouring of Spirit and you will experience, hopefully once again, the impressions that you are special.&nbsp; That you are known.&nbsp; That you are loved.&nbsp; That you are a son or daughter of God.&nbsp; And just think, this can be your experience every single day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second principle I wish to address is that of the <strong>prayer of faith</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to illustrate this principle by drawing upon the scriptural account of Nephi and his brothers Laman and Lemuel.&nbsp; You will remember the opening verse to the Book of Mormon stating that Nephi was &ldquo;born of goodly parents,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;therefore he was taught somewhat in all the learning of his father&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we do not often consider is that this same verse applies to Laman and Lemuel.&nbsp; Were they not too born of goodly parents?&nbsp; Were they not too taught in all the learning of their father?&nbsp; Certainly they were.&nbsp; Nephi goes on to write in verse sixteen of the first chapter of first Nephi, that his father Lehi had &ldquo;written many things which he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he prophesied and spake unto his children . . .&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These writings of Lehi of which Nephi spoke, including his visions and prophesies, were also available and taught to Laman and Lemuel.&nbsp; How, then, can it be written of these two brothers the following: &ldquo;. . . And they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them&rdquo;?&nbsp; After all they had been taught and exposed to, as children of a prophet, how could they not know the dealings of God in their lives?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is revealed in a series of scriptural verses that all lead to the same conclusion.&nbsp; Laman and Lemuel did not believe and therefore murmured because they did not inquire of the Lord.&nbsp; Nephi wrote that his father had taught his children &ldquo;many great things . . . which were hard to be understood save a man should inquire of the Lord; and they being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they ought&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further emphasize this point, listen to this exchange between Nephi and these murmuring brothers.&nbsp; Lehi had just taught them about the scattering and gathering of Israel comparing it to an olive tree.&nbsp; Laman and Lemuel were disputing because they did not understand the words which their father spoke to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi writes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I said unto them: Have ye inquired of the Lord?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they said unto me: We have not; for the Lord maketh no such thing known unto us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, I said unto them: How is it that ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord?&nbsp; How is it that ye will perish, because of the hardness of your hearts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said? &ndash; If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Laman and Lemuel, like their brother Nephi had been taught marvelous things.&nbsp; They had witnessed miracles.&nbsp; They had even been visited by an angel of the Lord.&nbsp; One would think that they should be like unto Nephi, faithful, stalwart, and true.&nbsp; But, and here is the point, they lacked the desire to make the prayer of faith.&nbsp; And without faith, the faith sufficient to inquire of the Lord, even being taught by a Prophet, experiencing miracles, and witnessing the visitation of an angel are not enough to establish one&rsquo;s conversion and therefore benefits them not at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prophet Mormon warned that if anyone &ldquo;shall pray and not with real intent of heart . . . it profiteth him nothing, for God receiveth none such&rdquo;.&nbsp; To make our prayers meaningful, we must pray with sincerity and &ldquo;with all the energy of heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Doctrine and Covenants expresses this same point this way; &ldquo;And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach&rdquo;.&nbsp; A natural extension to this thought is that &ldquo;if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not LEARN.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We live in a time when the greatest truths known to man are found on the earth.&nbsp; They are here for any honest seeker of truth to find.&nbsp; Most importantly, they are given with the promise that those who desire, those who inquire of the Lord in faith, will have truth manifest unto them. &nbsp;&nbsp;To pray the prayer of faith requires no magic formula.&nbsp; Such a prayer is within reach of each of us.&nbsp; It simply requires the desire that inspires the effort.&nbsp; This was the pattern discovered by Joseph Smith wanting with all his heart to know which Church to join.&nbsp; This desire led him to his sacred grove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found my sacred grove after having received my mission call.&nbsp; I grew up in the Church and always had the expectation that I would serve a mission.&nbsp; However, the first 19-years of my life were lived, at least spiritually, on borrowed light.&nbsp; I went through the motions of conversion because that is what I was taught to do by my parents.&nbsp; That is until my mission.&nbsp; While in the Mission Training Center, separated from those I love and those things which I thought gave my life meaning, I came to realize just how ill prepared emotionally and spiritually I was to serve.&nbsp; I struggled greatly and even doubted my own ability to fulfill my call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It came to a point where I knew that I must either gain a testimony of the work I was to do and the Gospel I was to proclaim, or I must abandon the cause.&nbsp; On the third floor of the dormitory where my room was located there was, just down the hall, a janitor&rsquo;s closet.&nbsp; It was the one place I determined I could go and be alone.&nbsp; There I went and there I opened my heart and soul to my Heavenly Father.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember the words I spoke, but I remember the urgent desire I felt to find answer.&nbsp; I left that closet a different man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My challenges did not entirely go away.&nbsp; I still struggled to learn a foreign language.&nbsp; I still felt the pains of homesickness, but I did not doubt where I needed to be and what I was to do.&nbsp; My heart was full of faith and it informed my mind that nothing else really now mattered than what the Lord would have me do.&nbsp; You see, I had found my own sacred grove and life was never the same for me again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, you too have a sacred grove.&nbsp; Those of you who have found it, need to return to it often; again and again to keep the spark of faith alive and, in order to maintain your connection to the divine source of power.&nbsp; For those of you who are still searching, or who are living on borrowed light as I was, I offer the following thought as a means to inspire your continued search and desire.&nbsp; The message of the restoration is either true or it is not.&nbsp; If it is true, can you imagine anything of greater consequence and value to you personally than knowing for yourself?&nbsp; No one can ask for you.&nbsp; No one can demand your attention to this matter of what is true.&nbsp; Only you have the right to decide to know and the only way to know of spiritual truth &ndash; any truth, is by way of the prayer of faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third and final principle I wish to address today is that of the <strong>prayer of gratitude</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We live in a world where people are quick to blame when things go wrong and slow to remember their God when things go right.&nbsp; This is exemplified in the story of the careless roofer (that&rsquo;s R-O-O-F-E-R).&nbsp; One day perched high on a building&rsquo;s roof replacing shingles, a man lost his footing and began to tumble down the roof toward the edge and beyond to certain death.&nbsp; In this terrifying moment, the man offered a hasty prayer saying; &ldquo;Dear God, if you will stop my fall I promise to devote my life to thy service.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that moment, a protruding nail caught his pant and stopped his fall just short of the edge.&nbsp; Realizing the fall had been averted, he offered a supplemental prayer saying; &ldquo;Never mind Lord, I took care of the problem myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prayer of gratitude is discovered as we take time to remember the source of all our blessings.&nbsp; As we do so we will recognize how much our Heavenly Father has done for us and we will desire to express our thanks to Him.&nbsp; The Book of Mormon prophet, Amulek taught, that we should, &ldquo;live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he [our Heavenly Father] doth bestow upon [us]&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This demeanor of gratitude is exemplified for us in the scriptures.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s again look to the writings and experiences of young Nephi.&nbsp; Nephi was &ldquo;chosen in the furnace of affliction&rdquo;.&nbsp; From the time he was a young man, perhaps younger than some of you here today, Nephi faced great challenge.&nbsp; Among other things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, one unfamiliar with the Lord&rsquo;s work and His capacity to qualify the willing heart may think that Nephi would be justified in his own spiritual rebellion.&nbsp; And yet, what did Nephi say?&nbsp; &ldquo;. . . Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did <strong>praise</strong> him all the daylong; and I did not murmur against the Lord because of mine afflictions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Praise, in this verse, is a form of gratitude.&nbsp; Nephi teaches us that gratitude is the recognition of God&rsquo;s power and influence in our life and the expression of thanksgiving to Him for all blessings.&nbsp; His example also suggest an additional element to our definition of gratitude; that of expressing thanks even when things do not go our way, or at least as we think they should go.&nbsp; Therefore, gratitude is a divine attribute.&nbsp; It is a sign of maturity, an indication of humility, the hallmark of civility, the bringer of hope, the motivator of reciprocal kindness, and the companion to charity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gratitude helps to put things into perspective.&nbsp; It reminds the natural man, who is often drawn into to the ugly world of self-pity; that life is good, that life is fair, and that earthly challenges are transitory while the blessings that come from them &ndash; which they surely will &ndash; are eternal.&nbsp; Hence, gratitude empowers the spiritual man. It brings an optimism and an enthusiasm for living each day.&nbsp; It emboldens our reliance upon the Lord and His commands.&nbsp; It makes of us the type of person that others wish to be around and emulate.&nbsp; It brings honor to the obedient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this last point of bringing honor to the obedient, you may recall the Savior&rsquo;s experience as he was traveling to Jerusalem passing through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.&nbsp; There came to Him ten men who were plagued with Leprosy.&nbsp; The law would not allow them to approach the Savior as they were labeled as &ldquo;unclean.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore, from a distance they lifted up their voices calling unto Him saying &ldquo;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Savior did show mercy to them and instructed that they go show themselves to the Priests.&nbsp; This instruction is important because again, according to Jewish law, they were not able to return to their homes and family, they were not able to enjoy the association of communal life again until the priest had pronounced them clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then see a profound example of faithful obedience, for the scriptural account reads that &ldquo;as they went, they were cleansed&rdquo;.&nbsp; Notice it read, &ldquo;As they went.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not a situation of their being cleansed and then, upon realizing such, turning to go see the Priest.&nbsp; Rather it was the demonstration of their faith and obedience to the Lord&rsquo;s command that they go, that won for them the miraculous healing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know how long these 10-men had been burdened with this dreadful disease and how long it had been since they were able to be with those they loved, but I am sure it was no small matter to be told, in effect, that they could go home.&nbsp; I imagine upon hearing this, the only thought pressing upon their minds was to get to the priest as quickly as was possible in order to receive permission to again return to their loved ones, and so they eagerly went.&nbsp; I say this not to excuse their failure to recognize their benefactor, but only to say that I understand their haste.&nbsp; However, and to his credit, there was one &ndash; only one, that upon seeing he was healed paused, putting aside the excitement that surely he felt to return home, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God.&nbsp; He then went to the Savior and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me share with you a modern day experience that equals that of this one Samaritan who returned to give thanks to the Savior.&nbsp; This experience tells the story of a young BYU-Idaho student who returned to give thanks to their Stake President.&nbsp; This student allowed themself to become plagued with the spiritual affliction of transgression.&nbsp; The seriousness of this transgression required the Stake President to send the student home.&nbsp; There, the Bishop began to work with them helping them through the repentance process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can imagine the heart-ache, frustration, and even anger this student felt.&nbsp; And yet, there was obedience and the student left for home in order to find spiritual healing.&nbsp; As noble a thing it was for this student to obediently comply with the requirement to &ldquo;go home and face the fire,&rdquo; it was but a small thing in comparison to the noble act which followed.&nbsp; This student, in time, and after realizing the blessing and the miracle of forgiveness, sent a letter back to the Stake President who had sent him home.&nbsp; With the president&rsquo;s permission, I read to you the student&rsquo;s letter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . I don&rsquo;t know if you remember me.&nbsp; We had a[n] interview together about a year and a half ago.&nbsp; You asked me to return home and &lsquo;face the fire.&rsquo;&nbsp; I spent the last year and a half &lsquo;facing the fire.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was able to meet with my bishop weekly and having the support of my family was exactly what I needed.&nbsp; My testimony of this gospel has grown immensely.&nbsp; My testimony of the atonement and my Savior is so real now.&nbsp; When I first came home I struggled a lot.&nbsp; I was bitter that I was asked to leave school.&nbsp; But one day I was reading in the Miracle of Forgiveness and there was a list of questions that I asked myself.&nbsp; One was &lsquo;could you accept excommunication for the sin if deemed necessary?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;If you were, would you become bitter at the church and it&rsquo;s officers?&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s when my heart was softened.&nbsp; I realized yes, I would be willing to be excommunicated and I would be willing to work my way back to the church.&nbsp; I was no longer bitter at having to come home, but <strong>thankful</strong>.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t be who I am today and I wouldn&rsquo;t have this strong of a testimony had I not gone through this process.&nbsp; <strong>I wanted to thank you for listening to the spirit</strong>.&nbsp; I now have a temple recommend and I am back here at school and my relationship with my family is even closer and better then it ever was.&nbsp; <strong>Thank you</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you see the nobility in this simple act of gratitude?&nbsp; Does it not magnify the initial act of obedience?&nbsp; The point, then, is this; even obedient behavior of such faithful proportions as was demonstrated by the 10-Lepers and this one student, is lessened in value and nobility if there is not thanks returned to the benefactor.&nbsp; Expressing gratitude is not only a celestial attribute warranting spiritual blessings of great value, it has also been proven to have a temporal benefit of significant physical and mental value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not long ago, Dr. Michael McCollough, of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, and Dr. Robert Emmons, of the University of California at Davis, conducted a research project on gratitude and thanksgiving.&nbsp; The study required several hundred people in three different groups to keep daily diaries.&nbsp; The first group kept a diary of the events that occurred during the day.&nbsp; The second group recorded their unpleasant experiences.&nbsp; The last group made a daily list of things for which they were grateful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the study indicated that daily gratitude exercises resulted in higher reported levels of alertness, enthusiasm, determination, optimism and energy.&nbsp; Additionally, the gratitude group experienced less depression and stress, was more likely to help others, exercised more regularly and made more progress toward personal goals.&nbsp; According to the findings, people who feel grateful are also more likely to feel loved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McCollough suggests that anyone can increase their sense of well-being and create positive social effects for themselves just from counting their blessings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Closing</span></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, we know the demands you face in life are many.&nbsp; We know the requirements of being a student are great.&nbsp; We know the standards of a BYU-Idaho student are exacting.&nbsp; And, we know the expectations of one who is a Disciple of Christ to be, at times, daunting &ndash; especially in light of earthly pressures.&nbsp; However, we also know that you are capable.&nbsp; We want you to know that we love you.&nbsp; We know of your goodness.&nbsp; We know your desires are righteous.&nbsp; We know you are trying hard to do everything that is expected of you and we express our gratitude for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you go forward into this new semester my hope is that you will find your spiritual connection in prayer.&nbsp; That your desires may always be turned to Him who can be the source of your power, lifting you above worldly influences and even beyond your own fears and doubts.&nbsp; My prayer for you is that you may recognize, as did the powerful Book of Mormon missionary, Ammon; that &ldquo;. . . for in his strength [your Heavenly Father&rsquo;s,] [you] can do all things . . .&ldquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I leave you my witness that God lives, that he hears and answers our prayers and that He is anxious to bless us in our needs.&nbsp; I bear witness that as we cultivate a thankful heart and a gracious demeanor we will find favor in the sight of the Lord.&nbsp; I testify that Jesus is the Christ, that He is our Savior, and that His Gospel has been restored to the earth in this, the dispensation of the fullness of times.&nbsp; I testify that no greater knowledge is there for one to possess than this and the blessed miracle is that such knowledge is accessible to each one of us who desires and seeks it with honest intent.&nbsp; May the Lord bless you to this end I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Kim B. Clark became the 15th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in August 2005. &nbsp;From April 2007 through April 2014, he served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br /><br />President Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and raised in Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;After serving as a missionary for the Church in Germany, he married his wife, Sue, in 1971. &nbsp;President Clark earned bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in economics from Harvard University.<br /><br />In 1978 Kim Clark became a member of the faculty at the Harvard Business School, and in 1995 he became dean of the school. &nbsp;He served in that capacity until his departure to become the president of BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we are grateful to speak to you on another great day at BYU-Idaho. &nbsp;We pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us, that we might learn what Heavenly Father would have us do to rise to the great responsibilities and the great opportunities He has given us.<br /><br />When I was eleven years old, my family moved from Salt Lake City to Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;Not long after we moved there, I signed up for a paper route.&nbsp;<br /><br />My bedroom was in the basement of our house, and every morning at about 4:30 my mother would get up and come downstairs and open my door and say, "It's time to get up.&nbsp; Rise and shine." &nbsp;Now, I know that the basic purpose of those words was to get me out of bed and out the door so I could do my route. &nbsp;But I have the feeling now that when my mother said, "rise and shine" she had much more in her mind and heart than getting a paper route done. &nbsp;I think she saw with a mother's eye of faith that, that young boy would someday be a missionary, a husband, a young father, a Church leader, and a man of God. &nbsp;And he would need to know how to get up and get going.&nbsp; He would need to rise to the purposes and destiny God had prepared for him, and he would need to live so the light of the gospel would be in his eyes and in his heart. &nbsp;He would need to "rise and shine" all of his life. &nbsp;And so, she got up early and said those words to that boy, for which I will be eternally grateful.&nbsp;<br /><br />The call to rise up and prepare for the great work God has given us to do is a call that echoes all through the scriptures down to the living prophets in our day. &nbsp;And we hear it in the Savior's own voice when He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verily I say unto you all: &nbsp;Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>This is our call, brothers and sisters. &nbsp;It is our call to rise and shine.&nbsp;<br /><br />Listen to the words of the hymn the choir sang today:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Rise up, O men of God!<br />Have done with lesser things.<br />Give heart and soul and mind and strength<br />To serve the King of Kings.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>This hymn is addressed to the men of the Church. &nbsp;It is a clarion call to rise and shine. But the call, and the principles in the hymn, apply equally well to the sisters.&nbsp; In fact, men and women must face and heed this call together.We would like to focus today on the preparation you need to make now to receive God's greatest gift--the opportunity to create an eternal family and qualify for exaltation and eternal life.&nbsp;<br /><br />In&nbsp;<em>The Family: A Proclamation to the World,</em>&nbsp;living prophets teach us true doctrine about our eternal identity as sons and daughters of God and about the central role of marriage and family life in Heavenly Father's plan. &nbsp;The Proclamation is a prophetic window on your future as husbands and wives, mothers and fathers of an eternal family. &nbsp;Nothing is more important.You first learned about these blessings in the pre-mortal council:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for&nbsp;joy.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You shouted for joy then because of your faith that Jesus Christ would be the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind.&nbsp; Through the Atonement of Christ you and a beloved eternal companion could create an eternal family, experience the joy of heaven on earth, and return to the presence of Heavenly Father "crowned with celestial glory,"&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;"raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God,"&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;"in [whose] presence&nbsp;<em>is</em>fulness of joy."&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The prophetic window of the Proclamation gives each of us a beautiful picture of what our future holds.&nbsp; Everything about marriage and family life is in that picture, including dating, finding the right one, having children, changing their diapers, loving them, teaching them, and the many, many other challenges and joys that rearing children and building an eternal family bring.&nbsp;<br /><br />These blessings come at different times to different people.&nbsp; In mortal life we often encounter unexpected delays and disappointments. &nbsp;But it is good to have in front of us a vivid picture of our divine destiny as sons and daughters of God. &nbsp;That picture is real. &nbsp;We bear witness that the promises are true. &nbsp;Through the Atonement of Christ, and through your faithfulness, you can obtain all of God's promised blessings, every one, on the timetable of the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />And so we say, rise up brothers and sisters. &nbsp;Rise and shine. &nbsp;No matter your circumstance, whether you are single or married, there is much you can do now to prepare and qualify for the blessings and the responsibilities of an eternal family.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preparing for an Eternal Family</strong><br />The Proclamation teaches us that parents in an eternal family have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness. &nbsp;In this sacred duty, mothers and fathers have four "sacred responsibilities."&nbsp;<br /><br />By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. &nbsp;Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. &nbsp;In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />There are many things you can do now to prepare and qualify for these great blessings, some of which you are doing already--strengthening your faith in the Savior; obeying the commandments; gaining an education; learning how to preside and plan; learning how to sacrifice and serve; learning how to teach; and, of course, learning how to cook, and much else. But we would like to mention some additional preparations that we believe deserve your special focus.&nbsp;<br /><br />We would like to speak first to the brothers, but we invite the sisters to listen carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brother Preparation #1: Priesthood Leadership in the Home</strong><br />Brethren, the greatest experience of your life will be to stand together with your wife at the head of your eternal family. &nbsp;With the power of the holy priesthood in your life and in your marriage, you will love, guide, direct, and teach the children God entrusts to your care. &nbsp;United with your eternal companion, and with the Lord Jesus Christ, you will bring priesthood leadership to your family.&nbsp;<br /><br />Whether you are married or single, the best way to prepare for priesthood leadership in your home is to be a priesthood leader now.&nbsp; No matter what your calling in the Church may be, you can be a priesthood leader.&nbsp;<br /><br />We want to ask you some questions about your priesthood leadership and about your homes.&nbsp; Think of these questions as guidelines for your personal preparation and development as a priesthood leader in your home:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Are you magnifying your calling as an Elder in Israel?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do you feel responsible for the spiritual welfare of those God entrusts to your care?&nbsp; Do you act on that feeling and go to them in priesthood service?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do you act in faith in Christ to follow the impressions of the Spirit even when it is inconvenient or perhaps uncomfortable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do you carry out your callings and assignments ". . . by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness, and pure knowledge . . ."?&nbsp;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Are you always ready and worthy to exercise the holy priesthood, even at a moment's notice?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Is there anything in your life that would prevent you from receiving revelation and spiritual gifts from the Holy Ghost?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do you live a life of personal honor? &nbsp;Are you "true at all times?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do you "feast upon the words of Christ" every day?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do you pray with real intent, with all the energy of your heart?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do you attend the temple often? &nbsp;Are your temple covenants written in your heart?</p>
<p>&nbsp;These are important questions for you and for me.&nbsp; All of us should be working toward a resounding "Yes" in answer to them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now consider these questions about the home:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do you follow the counsel given to us by Elder David A. Bednar to be more concerned and diligent at home?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Are you aware of those around you who need words of encouragement, support, and love? &nbsp;Do you share those words with them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Have you born your testimony to your family at FHE or to your friends or roommates or classmates lately?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Are you consistent in your prayers, in scripture study, and in family home evening?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Is your home or apartment a spiritual sanctuary where the Holy Ghost can dwell?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do you live providently making wise use of your money, time, and talents?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do you treat all women and girls with honor and respect as daughters of God?</p>
<p>As you ponder your answers to these questions, I hope you will realize that you are establishing patterns today that will carry over into your homes tomorrow.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you are faithful and magnify your callings in the priesthood (including being more concerned and diligent at home), Heavenly Father will bless you with the powers of heaven; with the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit; with the watchful care of His angels; and, indeed, with all that He has. &nbsp;You will be a priesthood leader.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brethren, your eternal family needs you to keep your promises. &nbsp;Your wife and children will need the particular powers of heaven that will come to them only through you and the priesthood. &nbsp;You need to prepare now so that you will be ready then.&nbsp;<br /><br />I share with you today a personal experience with priesthood power. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Sue and I met about two months after I returned from my mission and were married several months later in June of 1971.&nbsp; At the time of this story, we had been married for six years.&nbsp; I was in graduate school and we had three children--a little boy almost four, a little girl almost two, and a brand new baby boy, about two weeks old.&nbsp;<br /><br />One day I came home from graduate school to find our home in total chaos. &nbsp;The baby was crying; the two little kids were running around wreaking havoc; there were toys all over our little apartment; and Sue was exhausted and in tears.&nbsp;<br /><br />I pitched in and tried to corral the older children and clean up the apartment.&nbsp; As I went to work, the Spirit whispered to me.&nbsp; "Give your wife a blessing."&nbsp; So, right there in the middle of chaos, Sue sat on a chair and I gave her a blessing.&nbsp; In that moment it was as if a spiritual cocoon settled in around us. &nbsp;Heavenly Father had prepared a blessing for His beloved daughter, my wife, and I was privileged to deliver His blessing to her by the power of the holy priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;The blessing was full of words of astonishing breadth and power. &nbsp;Sue received promises of strength and capacity and sweet blessings about our children and our family here on earth and in the eternities. &nbsp;When I finished, I hugged her for a long time. &nbsp;It was a powerful, spiritual, priesthood experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />After that blessing we still had to pick up the toys and establish order and get the kids fed and to bed. &nbsp;But I am grateful that my husband heard the whisperings of the Spirit and was prepared in that moment to use the holy priesthood to give me a blessing.&nbsp;<br /><br />That preparation began many years before.&nbsp; As President Henry B. Eyring taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[Preparation] must begin long before the crisis which requires priesthood power.<br />. . . the preparation that counts will be made by the young men making choices to rise to their great destiny as priesthood servants for God.<br />What you will need in the dramatic moment will be built in the steady performance of obedient service.<br />So you must have faith that God lives and that you have won His confidence to allow you to use His power for His purposes.&nbsp;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Here are the great keys to your preparation for priesthood leadership in the home: steady performance of obedient service and increased faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brother Preparation #2: Cleave Unto Her and None Else</strong><br />Brethren, the Lord gave this commandment about your relationship with your wife: Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.&nbsp;<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Some of you have already found your eternal companion. &nbsp;You know who she is. &nbsp;You have entered into sacred covenants with her. &nbsp;Your commitment to her must be total--she must have all your heart and you must cleave unto her and none else. &nbsp;Her interests and concerns should be your interests.&nbsp; Her happiness and well-being should be the desire of your heart. Nothing should compete in your heart for your emotional, spiritual, and physical affection and devotion to your wife--nothing--no other person, no other thing.&nbsp;<br /><br />None else means just that--no flirting or emotional relationships with other women. &nbsp;But it also means no devotion to a career or to virtual relationships or social networking online or pornography. &nbsp;It means the needs and interests of your wife and family come before your boss, before the old buddies, before video games, sports, hunting, fishing, four-wheeling, camping, and anything else that would take you away from them. &nbsp;You need to provide for your family.&nbsp; You may still enjoy wholesome activities, but now they happen in the context of your marriage and your family. &nbsp;What you do, you plan together; and many of these activities you enjoy with your wife and your children.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of you have not yet found your eternal companion. &nbsp;Even though you don't know who she is, you can cleave unto her and none else while you are looking for her. &nbsp;Now, that means you have to look for her; but the same principles apply--no sexual relations outside of marriage; no commitments or addictions to anything that will interfere with your total devotion to your wife and family. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Brethren, prepare to be a righteous husband and father--avoid lust and the associated affliction of pornography like the destructive, addictive poison they are. &nbsp;Don't get caught up in and addicted to video or on-line games or virtual relationships or social networking or work or outdoor recreation or sports or anything else. &nbsp;If you are caught in an addiction, don't try to justify it. &nbsp;Please get help now.&nbsp; You can be rid of its destructive power, but you have to act now to get help. &nbsp;Don't wait.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brethren, the hymn we read earlier says it very well:&nbsp; [Now is the time to] "have done with lesser things."&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp; Now is the time to prepare and qualify. &nbsp;Now is the time to rise and shine.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preparation for the Sisters</strong><br />We would like to speak now to the sisters, but we invite the brethren to listen closely.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sister Preparation #1: Honor the Priesthood of God</strong><br />Sisters, whether you are single or married, the most important things in your life and in the life of your eternal family will come to you through the authority and power of God. &nbsp;You receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and temple ordinances and covenants through the holy priesthood. &nbsp;You will be sealed to your husband and receive together the highest blessings of the holy priesthood in the house of the Lord. Blessings and power and joy and happiness will come to your eternal family because you honor God's power and authority.&nbsp;<br /><br />You can prepare to honor the priesthood of God in your eternal family by honoring the priesthood now.&nbsp;<br /><br />Honoring the priesthood begins with the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;Jesus is the Great High Priest. &nbsp;Learn of Him. &nbsp;Love Him. &nbsp;Keep His commandments.&nbsp;<br /><br />Honoring the priesthood means keeping your covenants. &nbsp;It means learning about and loving the oath and covenant of the priesthood and the covenant of eternal marriage and the ordinances and covenants of the temple. &nbsp;Go to the temple often. &nbsp;Pray that God will bless you to love the temple and that He will write your temple covenants in your heart. &nbsp;Remember, "in the ordinances [of the Melchizedek Priesthood], the power of godliness is manifest."&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;You will need the power of godliness in your life and in your family.&nbsp; Prepare for it by honoring the priesthood of God.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have one more bit of advice: &nbsp;honor the priesthood of God by helping the brothers around you honor the priesthood they hold. &nbsp;If you are married, help your husband honor his priesthood. &nbsp;If you are single, encourage the brothers around you.&nbsp; Support them and inspire them. &nbsp;Sisters, listen to this counsel to you from President Henry B. Eyring:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . you may have friends whose lives could be changed forever by how you feel about the oath and covenant of the priesthood and the covenant of marriage in the house of the Lord.&nbsp; You may have more influence than you can imagine on a young man's keeping the oath and covenant of the priesthood and on whether he will know the joy of making covenants in the temple.&nbsp; If you love those covenants, he is more likely to love and honor them.&nbsp;<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>There have been many, many young men whose lives have been changed by righteous sisters who helped them honor the oath and covenant of the priesthood. &nbsp;You know that has everything to do with dressing modestly and having high standards for yourself and your eternal companion. &nbsp;Here is a story from Elder Richard G. Scott about his, then future, wife Jeanene:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During my last year at the university, I looked forward to the prospects of a fine professional future and thought I had my life very well outlined. &nbsp;Then a kind and thoughtful Lord placed a bombshell in my little world. &nbsp;Her name was Jeanene Watkins. . . . &nbsp;The more I knew her, the more fascinated I became. &nbsp;She radiated goodness.&nbsp; She was exuberantly enthusiastic and happy. &nbsp;Each opportunity to be with her deepened the growing love in my heart. &nbsp;One evening&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she innocently said, "When I marry, I'll marry in the temple, a returned missionary." &nbsp;That comment struck me to the core. &nbsp;It started me on a process of reflection, contemplation, and prayer that resulted in my receiving a call as a missionary to Uruguay.&nbsp;<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>Sisters, honor the priesthood, love the Savior, keep your covenants, love the temple, and help the brothers honor the priesthood.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sister Preparation #2: Love to Learn, Love to Teach</strong><br />Nurturing children in light and truth is a partnership with God.&nbsp; By divine design, mothers are the great educators of mankind. &nbsp;Prepare now, sisters, to love to learn and love to teach. &nbsp;You will have powerful influence on your children (and your husband) because you love learning and teaching.&nbsp;<br /><br />The key to this preparation is the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;As you teach your children the gospel, and everything else, the Holy Ghost will help you, support you, and bless you. &nbsp;Prepare now for that great day by listening to the whisperings of the Spirit in your life and qualifying for the companionship of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; You have been given majestic promises:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Therefore it is given to abide in you; the record of heaven; the Comforter; the peaceable things of immortal glory; the truth of all things; that which quickeneth all things, which maketh alive all things; that which knoweth all things, and hath all power according to wisdom, mercy, truth, justice, and judgment.&nbsp;<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>These are your privileges.&nbsp; If you act in faith to keep the commandments and follow the guidance of the Spirit, God will bless you with these great gifts.&nbsp;<br /><br />Your time in the university can be a time of preparation in learning and teaching by the Spirit. &nbsp;As you study and prepare in school, pray that God will bless you with insights and gifts that will help you prepare to teach your children. &nbsp;Pray for a love of the scriptures and of the words of the prophets. &nbsp;Pray for a love of the commandments and the covenants and the temple of God. &nbsp;Pray for your heart to be changed by the Atonement of Christ so that He may work in you to help you become more and more like Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />Pray for a love of ideas, a love to read, a love to explore the marvelous world around us. Pray that you will find joy in the creations of God--the earth, the stars, the plants and animals--so that you will see in them "God moving in his majesty and power."&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray that God will bless you with a love of music, art, and literature, and a love of creative work of all kinds, including sewing, cooking, and crafts. &nbsp;And pray to love helping others to love these things, too.&nbsp;<br /><br />Pray and then get up off your knees and go to work! &nbsp;Read, study, explore, and create! &nbsp;Keep the commandments; listen to the Spirit, and God will bless you to love to learn and love to teach and your children will love these things too. &nbsp;They will love the Lord because you love Him. &nbsp;They will learn to love because you love. &nbsp;They will want to be clean and pure because you are. &nbsp;And they will experience the joy of learning and teaching because that joy is in you.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sisters, now is the time to have the companionship of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;Now is the time to act in faith to love to learn and to love to teach. &nbsp;Now is the time to rise and shine.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />We have spoken today of the gifts and blessings Heavenly Father has prepared for you. We have urged all of you to rise and shine, to prepare to create an eternal family, and to qualify for exaltation and eternal life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of you is in a different stage of your personal spiritual development. &nbsp;Each of you will face different challenges. &nbsp;But each of you, no matter your circumstances, can rise and shine.&nbsp;<br /><br />What we have described today may seem far above where you are right now, perhaps far above what you think is possible. &nbsp;You may be worried and even afraid that the blessings won't come, that you won't be able to do it. &nbsp;You may be afraid for your children or afraid you won't have children. &nbsp;You may be unsure of the way forward.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Brothers and sisters, don't be afraid. &nbsp;We want to leave you today with encouragement and hope. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We know you can rise and shine because we have seen you rising and shining.&nbsp; We have seen your obedience, your courage, and your hard work.&nbsp; We have seen your unselfish service, your humility, your love, and your faith and trust in the Savior.&nbsp; And we have seen His love for you.&nbsp; He has lifted you and strengthened you, and we are witnesses of His almighty power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We know from our experience that everything about becoming a husband or wife and a father or mother in an eternal family is an act of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;Looking for your eternal companion, finding that companion, and deciding to marry is an act of faith. Deciding to have children is an act of faith. &nbsp;Rearing children in love and righteousness is an act of faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />All of these things take sacrifice and effort.&nbsp; But getting married and having children is not about money or skill.&nbsp; It is about faith.&nbsp; These are acts of faith in Jesus Christ, in His atoning sacrifice, and in His redeeming love.&nbsp; These are acts of faith that the Savior can change your heart, lift your burdens, and strengthen your capacity with His almighty power.&nbsp;<br /><br />We bear witness of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;He is the living Son of the living God. &nbsp;We testify of His love, of His mercy, and of His grace. &nbsp;We have seen Him work in power in our lives and in the lives of our children. &nbsp;We know He lives and leads His Church through His living prophets. In His power and with His strength we know you can rise and shine. &nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former President, Manila Philippines Temple</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is an exciting day for me and my wife. It is one we have looked forward to. We knew we would be with some forward looking youth in a wonderful setting. President Clark, Administrators, Faculty, Staff, and Students, I am honored to be with you. I express sincere thanks for the invitation to come to this very special university.<br /><br />In planning to be with you, I have reflected on some of the beautiful thoughts others have expressed about gospel concepts. Some have purposely sought inspiration to be able to say in words what many of us feel in our hearts but don't always know how to express. Many of these thoughts and feelings have been put to music and we sing them as our hymns.&nbsp;<br /><br />That may be why Elder Russell M. Nelson said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Some of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns. Hymns move us to repentance and good works, build testimony and faith, comfort the weary, console the mourning and inspire us to endure to the end."&nbsp;</em>(Russell M. Nelson, "The Power and Protection of Worthy Music," ensign, Dec, 2009, 13-17).</p>
<p>Hymns are an important part of our worship services. But too often, we just sing the words and do not digest their meaning. Today I thought I would look a little more deeply at one such hymn. It is one that is easily learned and can be used to fill your mind with virtuous thoughts when needed. Elder Nelson also said:&nbsp;<em>"We encourage you to memorize your favorite hymns and study the scriptures that relate to them. Then if unworthy thoughts enter your mind, sing a hymn to yourself crowding out eh evil with the good."</em>&nbsp;(Russell M. Nelson, "The Power and Protection of Worthy Music," ensign, Dec, 2009, 13-17).<em></em>&nbsp;<br /><br />The hymn I talk about today contains some inspired words written by Sister Naomi Randall.&nbsp; They were slightly edited by a prophet and then put to music composed by Sister Mildred Pettit. This is found as hymn number 301 in our hymn book. My wife and I have had the privilege of hearing this lovely hymn sung in many different languages, but whatever the language, a sweet, peaceful feeling comes with it.&nbsp;<br /><br />It begins with the remarkable realization that "I am a child of God." That he is the Father of my spirit - and your spirit as well. And what a unique and wonderful father we have. What is special for us is that we know what he looks like and what his purposes and intentions are.&nbsp; He knows everything. He has all knowledge. He is tremendously powerful because of his knowledge and goodness.&nbsp; But he knows and loves each one of us, as his child, in a way beyond what we can even imagine. He knows our name and what we think about and do. He has even said everything he does is to try and help us become like him. He also said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>And if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God."</em>&nbsp;(D&amp;C 14:7)&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a wonderful offer!&nbsp;<br /><br />He knows precisely how to obtain such a gift. In addition, he has told us how it can be ours, and then he lovingly encourages us to seek for it in all diligence. He sent his only begotten son to teach and show us what we need to do.&nbsp; We have learned we cannot earn this great blessing for others nor can anyone else earn it for us, even if they dearly want to. We each determine our own future.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are not many in the world that have the knowledge we do about our Heavenly Father. That understanding should be a reason for us to live differently than the rest of the world. I have observed that it is easy to recognize those who know they are a child of God and who see life as a purposeful gift from Him. They understand this is part of a great plan developed before the earth was even organized. They realize their best choice is to accept whatever role Father has for them as part of that marvelous plan. It is obvious how much more contented and peaceful people are who live with such an understanding of Father and his great work, no matter what comes into their lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />We should talk to our Father often in prayer. He hears us and wants to be close to us and help in our personal challenges. But when serious problems come and I desperately need help beyond my own abilities, I can only turn to Father.&nbsp; I don't want Him to think then that my voice is one He has not heard very often and that I only come to Him when I am desperate. There are countless blessings which should be acknowledged and given deserved words of gratitude. If we ever wonder what we should pray for, just begin by saying "Father, I want to thank you for..." and then there will be many things come to your mind you can talk about.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus taught us the best way to really get to know our Father in Heaven. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&nbsp; If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also..."</em>&nbsp;(John 14:6-7)</p>
<p>The more we know about Father and His only begotten son, the more we will love them.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is also good to remember the words given to us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things and obey not his commandments."</em>&nbsp;(D&amp;C 59:21)</p>
<p>I have learned what it feels like to be a Father. My understanding greatly enlarged when we had children of our own. They brought a significant broadening to my concept of what love can be. I sincerely appreciate when my children come to me to talk about what they are doing, to share ideas and maybe even ask for counsel or help. I want to help them even though they must use their own agency in making decisions. I desperately want them to find happiness and contentment. I am pleased when I see they have learned true happiness comes to us only when we give it away to others.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next part of this wonderful hymn acknowledges - "And he has sent me here."&nbsp; Since the beginning of mankind on the earth, the question has been asked - If God is so kind and loves me so much, why would he send me to a place where there is disease and dirt and earthquakes and terror and anger and hurricanes and sickness of all kinds and on and on?&nbsp;<br /><br />Over 2000 years ago, a father named Lehi, gave the simple answer to that question to his son, Jacob.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"For it must needs be, that there is opposition in all things. If not so...righteousness could not be brought to pass..."</em>&nbsp;(2 Nephi 2:11)</p>
<p>There is no way to become like Father unless we learn what comes with mortality including how to face trials, and temptations properly.&nbsp; Each challenge of our life is an opportunity for a choice to be made and the summary of our choices determines our future.&nbsp;<br /><br />Mother Eve learned that without a mortal body, our spirit could not understand the difference between health and sickness or between pleasure and pain or any other basic feelings.&nbsp; It is absolutely necessary for a spirit to be enveloped in a mortal body to learn and develop more fully.&nbsp; Mortal life is an important opportunity to experience, to overcome, to learn and to understand many things that could not be learned in any other way. Of great importance is that we see the challenges that come to us are for polishing and refining in the way we each need.&nbsp;<br /><br />I think we live at a most unique and wonderful time. It has been talked about and looked forward to for many centuries. It is a blessing to be here and have the experiences that come to each of us, including those that we really do not want.&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe we will all look back someday and realize that mortality was the perfect experience for us to grow and develop. The good times and the challenges will take on new perspective and will be seen as a loving effort to teach us what we couldn't learn any other way. It becomes very obvious as we get older that we become the result of the decisions we have made along the way, especially those we chose when challenges came to us.&nbsp;<br /><br />We continue on with "Has given me an earthly home."&nbsp; We can't even imagine how to organize a world that will sustain many billions of people over thousands of years. When Jehovah and Michael completed their part of organizing the world, they stopped and looked and stated what a glorious and beautiful result had been achieved.&nbsp;<br /><br />From the grandeur of Milford Sound in New Zealand to the pristine beauty of Sauniatu in Samoa, the Black Forest of Germany, the national parks of the U.S., beautiful waterfalls, the snow-capped Rockies, and many other features of this glorious and beautiful world have given me cause to truly marvel. We can't help but be in awe at the artistry, the beauty and imagination found in the animal world and in the fruits of the field. Sunrises and sunsets can be breathtaking. The formation of a rosebud with its pleasant aroma is one of a plethora of miracles. And it was all prepared just for us that we might experience mortality. And old counsel has been given that we should stop more often and smell the roses. Never be so caught up in the routine of life that you don't look around at a masterful creation and consider its purpose.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we do that, we can understand the words he gave us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And behold, all things have their likeness, and all things are created and made to bear record of me, both things which are temporal, and things which are spiritual...all things bear record of me."</em>&nbsp;(Moses 6:63)</p>
<p>Life is lived best when we keep a vision of who we are and where we are and see God's hand in everything around us. When we do that we are not so focused on the hardships and distractions that will come.&nbsp;<br /><br />What an ingenious concept family life is. We come into the world into arms of love because we have been given "Parents, kind and dear."&nbsp; They nurture us the best they can and before long, we become the parents. Then we have the responsibility to nurture others. If we ever felt mother and father could have done better for us, we have the opportunity to try and do better when it is our turn. But generally, we will gain greater appreciation for what father and mother did.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is most important to Father in Heaven that his spirit children all have opportunity at mortality.&nbsp; And they should come as part of an organized, loving family with its inherent ancestry. That is the core and heart of life. It is recorded that Elohim, himself stated three times during the creative process that multiplying and replenishing this earth with his spirit children was a primary objective. Anyone who doesn't understand that doesn't really comprehend one of the major purposes for this earth and our being here.&nbsp;<br /><br />Therefore, Satan puts great effort into thwarting that work. Our own fears of personal responsibility, abortions, relationships instead of marriage, or delaying marriage for worldly pursuits are results of his influence. Some insist on finding a perfect companion when they are not perfect themselves. Others are intent on seeking comforts, careers and gadgets before having children. Just hanging out without personal courting, and many other common practices are more evidence of Satan's influences. Anyone with an understanding of life and its purposes would never get caught up in such erroneous thinking.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is beautiful sanctity about bringing other spirits into this world. We take part in providing them with a mortal body so they can benefit from this great gift called life. I shall never forget the feelings I had while being with my wife as a new life, we had helped create, joined us. There is nothing to compare with the sound of that first cry or the feel of a newly born baby. And that is only the beginning of the joy that can come with a loving family when they are helping each other live the ways of the true gospel. And as years go on, we begin to understand the meaning of joy in our posterity.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have always appreciated that we had children even when we had very little to offer them except our love. That gave us a chance to see how the Lord helps those trying to do what is right, and he certainly did bless us. Our memories are full of the ways we were so richly blessed during some very financially lean years. And those children we were so concerned about have grown into healthy, happy and remarkable adults. They didn't have a lot of worldly things but they survived, appreciate life and we offer words of gratitude for each one of them every day.&nbsp;<br /><br />We can see that the request to "Lead Me, Guide Me," can be answered in many ways. We have scriptures and Priesthood leaders to help understand the lessons of most value to learn. This is truly an age of information but we are very wise if we carefully seek knowledge that has eternal value. I have appreciated many teachers, with good friends and parents included among them. A very special and most valued teacher has been my dear wife and companion of more than 56 years. Her example and views of life have greatly added to my understanding of what is good and how I could make better decisions.&nbsp;<br /><br />One thing we do know is that no matter how many sources or how much material is available, it is up to us personally to find how to benefit from them. And when we do,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come."</em>&nbsp;(D&amp;C 130:18-19)</p>
<p>We also come to understand we never fully comprehend the joy and power of gospel principles until we actually live them.&nbsp;<br /><br />In this wonderful hymn we are reviewing is a plea for help - "Walk beside me." There comes periods in every life when we seek comfort or understanding or forgiveness. That's when we yearn for the feeling that we are not alone and it can come when we seek for it. It may be in the darkness of night or the anguish of a terribly hard ordeal, but we are never alone. Peace will come whenever and wherever we may be if we turn in the right direction.&nbsp;<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many times I have been visited by angels in the form of friends or family members who did or said just what I needed at that time. They proved conclusively that I am not alone. I think of Abraham at the altar of Elkenah or Joseph Smith in the sacred grove, both in moments of anguish crying out to Father and then having this wonderful response and help.&nbsp; We are also heard when moments of trial come to us and we seek for help. In the Lord's way He will assure us that we are not alone. That's when we come to understand the meaning of tender mercies. It is also interesting that such experiences help us to be that certain someone who understands when someone else needs comfort or assurance.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is a reminder in the second verse of our hymn that we need to understand and do some very important things "Before it grows too late."&nbsp; Yes, there is a time when every knee will bow and we will confess who the Savior is.&nbsp; I imagine it to be a time of feeling love and understanding beyond anything we have even known or felt. But we will also see fairness and justice based on everything we have said or done or even thought with allowance for our repentance of wrongdoings. Every day we are preparing for that time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let us move on to the third verse of hymn #301.&nbsp; I would like to have all of you join with me as we sing this verse.&nbsp; As a reminder, it begins with "I am a child of God, rich blessings are in store."&nbsp; I trust you know the melody.&nbsp; So let us begin with that verse and please join in singing with me -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"I am a child of God. Rich blessings are in store</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;If I but learn to do His will, I'll live with Him once more.</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;Lead me, Guide me, walk beside me. Help me find the way</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>Teach me all that I must do to live with Him someday."</em><em></em>&nbsp;<br />How do we describe the rich blessings that are in store? Even God doesn't describe them in much detail. I assume that is because we don't have the vocabulary nor the experience nor the understanding to be able to comprehend what he has awaiting the faithful.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is what he says about the rich blessings in store for those who really want them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"For thus saith the Lord - I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory, and to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to come will I show them, even the things of many generations.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven: and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish and the understanding of the prudent shall come to naught.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"For by my spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will - yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man."</em>&nbsp;(D&amp;C 76:5-10)</p>
<p>All of this can be ours; blessings beyond our comprehension and we will live with him once more - "If I but learn to do his will." Where can we learn his will? We begin by reading the scriptures, attending and listening carefully in our meetings and classes, and meditating on what we see and hear while the spirit teaches us.&nbsp;<br /><br />But of all the people, you should be ones to understand you don't go from first grade directly into university-level studies. You don't become successful in significant professional roles by just wanting to be there. Nor do we become ready for exaltation and the rich blessings in store by just hoping for them. The only place on earth, you can gain all you need to know to return to Father properly, is through the temple ordinances.&nbsp;<br /><br />There we will find instructions which have been given to us through revelation and can be received and understood only through personal revelation. This means we must develop lives where we have trust in the Lord and have learned to listen to his spirit and we have carefully prepared ourselves in every way to enter into this great house of learning. If this is truly our desire, then it can serve as the best motivation for how we live each day so we can enter the temple when the time is right.&nbsp;<br /><br />The temple ordinances are all special experiences where you can have new thoughts and gain more understanding every time you witness one of them. You learn everything you need to know in the endowment about how to live in mortality in the most worthwhile way. You can even learn how to pass by guardian angels so you can successfully walk back to Father when the time is right.&nbsp;<br /><br />Many of the overwhelming challenges and problems or mortality become much less important and more manageable when we reflect on what we are taught in the temple. It expands our vision of life. The peace and spirit found there is becoming more and more in contrast to the world around us and give pleasant relief from a troubled world.&nbsp;<br /><br />The most significant blessings of the Priesthood can only be obtained in the temple. In fact the earth and all that has gone before is utterly wasted if the sealing covenant is not received by worthy couples and eventually sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise.&nbsp; Many set a goal of being married in the temple. I suggest it be the intent of everyone here to be sealed to a worthy mate in the temple and then let that covenant be the anchor and basis for everything you do the rest of your life. Being married in the temple is an important step but in itself, it is only part of the narrow path the Savior said leads to eternal life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Perhaps, as we are confronted every single day with the overwhelming influences of Satan in our world, we would do well to let hymn number 301 run through our minds often. It will help us remember who we are and why we are here.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we have not been to the temple yet, it will remind us that ultra rich blessings await us if we but learn and od God's will as taught there. If we ever think we are about as good as we can be, a few minutes reflecting on the Savior's experience in the Garden of Gethsemane will help us realize there are ways we can live much better to be more like him.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are other hymns that stir our minds in reflection of wonderful truths of the gospel.&nbsp; I am grateful for poets and composers who express these concepts so beautifully.&nbsp; Truly the restored gospel defines the way of life that brings understanding and happiness.&nbsp; I know with all my heart it is God's words, given in love to help us. In addition, he has given us prophets so we can understand better and have true teachings to follow each day. A temple is truly the House of the Lord and another remarkable gift for those who seek for truth.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have a deep sense of gratitude for the restored gospel. It helps me understand so much of what happens in my life, why it happens, and it gives a glimpse of an unimaginably wonderful future that is possible to have. It is for those who enter the strait gate and follow the narrow path which in our day has been clearly defined.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know there are many prayers offered for you. Many times I have even heard prayers in the temple asking Father to give special watchful care over the youth of the church. We know you are facing some of the most difficult and subtle temptations that Satan has ever thrown at mankind. It seems possible your generation is facing the most devious and powerful efforts the adversary has ever put forward. We know that some will not resist them if they do not live with exactness and honor those truths taught by the gospel and especially those taught in the temple. We also know the tremendous responsibility given to latter-day saints. We are to carry the gospel message to the world and to assure temple blessings are made available to every soul who has been or will be on this earth. We pray that you can realize what it means to be a Latter-Day Saint.&nbsp;<br /><br />May I join my prayer this day with those many other prayers for you. I pray that you will continually seek and follow the spirit in discerning the clear line between good and evil. I testify that God lives, we are his children, he has organized a beautiful world and sent us here to learn how to be more like him. He deeply wants us to return to Him. There is a clearly defined way to return to His presence. But it is up to each one of us to find and follow it and that requires sincere determination.&nbsp;<br /><br />We can all say with honor and gratitude - I am truly a child of God, and if I but learn to do his will, I'll live with Him once more.&nbsp; We should remember that possibility is only there because of the resurrection, redemption and atonement given so freely to us from our Father through our Savior. We are truly blessed beyond our imaginations but we are wise if we sometimes stop and think about what it all means.&nbsp; This I humbly and gratefully testify.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Emeritus Member General Authority Seventy</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sister Neuenschwander and I are so pleased and honored to be with you this afternoon.&nbsp; During my service as a General Authority I had a few opportunities to visit the BYU-Idaho campus.&nbsp; They were always wonderful experiences.&nbsp; I pray the Spirit of the Lord will attend my few remarks and that they will be of some worth to you.&nbsp; The title and text of my message is found in the words of the Apostle Paul to the Romans, wherein he writes: "I take my journey"&nbsp;<sup>1</sup><br /><br />The scriptures are full of references to significant journeys, be they of peoples, families, or individuals.&nbsp; They also describe in some detail the "paths", "ways", "roads", and "highways" on which those journeys take place.&nbsp; To cite just a few examples, there is the path of righteousness and the paths of the just and the wicked; there is the strait and narrow path that leads to the Tree of Life, as well as forbidden and unknown paths along the way; there are also paths of duty, wisdom, and virtue.&nbsp; Additionally, we can read of broad and strange roads, as well as the plain and strict ones. The Savior taught that He was the way&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>, which is in sharp contrast to His statement to the Prophet Joseph Smith that "every man walketh in his own way."&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of us is walking the road of our life's journey which is composed of countless smaller ones.&nbsp; Even though family, friends, and colleagues may counsel and help us along the way, each of us, like the Apostle Paul, comes to a point in our life where we must say: "<strong>I</strong>&nbsp;take my<strong>&nbsp;</strong>journey."&nbsp; My life has been full of interesting journeys.&nbsp; Today I would like to share with you four simple observations that I have noted along the roads of my life.&nbsp; They are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destination you choose will determine the road you take.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your every road in life will be a toll road.<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe in yourself in the face of the challenges along the roads of your life.<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn to enjoy the journey.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>First, the destination you choose will determine the road you take<br /></strong>Every journey has a destination and every destination a road.&nbsp; The only way for you to arrive at a pre-determined destination is to walk the road that takes you there. Consequently, identifying your various destinations, both spiritually and temporally, is no small decision for you to make. &nbsp;But destinations are more than a place and their attainment more than completing a checklist of requirements.&nbsp; Lofty destinations of lasting worth are composed of intensely personal dreams, aspirations, and ideas that demand the very best in you to reach them. The destinations you set for yourself must inflame your imagination and bring passion to your life.&nbsp; They must be worthy of the sacrifices you will surely make for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your destinations are the driving force of your life.&nbsp; They bring purpose, focus, hope, and enthusiasm to the roads that will eventually bring you to them.&nbsp; Your chosen destinations will assist you to make good decisions and solemn personal commitments.&nbsp; The purpose of our mortal journey is to prepare us to return to Heavenly Father's presence.&nbsp; This destination encompasses all others you may set for yourselves in the course of your lifetime.&nbsp; Fulfilling &nbsp;a mission or being sealed in the temple, for example, are important destinations but they only lead you along the road to your ultimate destination.&nbsp; Nonetheless, they will require your full commitment to achieve them.&nbsp; Your educational experience is likewise enlivened by the destination you have in mind.&nbsp; In my own case the image of teaching Russian literature in a small university where I could gather students together in the evening to talk about what they were reading was imprinted deeply on my mind and gave me reason to persevere through the difficult years of my educational journey.&nbsp; The destinations you set and the dreams that accompany them must make your road worth walking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The selection of destination most often takes place before you begin your actual journey.&nbsp; The best example of this is that of Jesus himself.&nbsp; In promising to be our Savior and Redeemer, He chose the road from Bethlehem to Golgotha, to the tomb, and beyond long before He ever put His foot there.&nbsp; His destination decreed His road.&nbsp; So it is with you and me.&nbsp; By choosing Heavenly Father's plan in the pre-mortal council, we chose our mortal road long before we ever started walking it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We understand this principle of destinations and roads very well when it comes to our spiritual progression.&nbsp; But, it can also be applied to your current educational journey.&nbsp; The decision regarding your academic destination is the basis of your academic success.&nbsp; The more quickly you can decide the purpose of your education, the more surely you will reach it.&nbsp; I must sadly admit that in my own case I fished around the university for a couple of years, between high school and my mission, taking courses of great interest to me, but with no real direction.&nbsp; I didn't know what courses to take because I didn't know where I was going.&nbsp; Once I made the decision to study Russian, my road through the university was clearly defined.&nbsp; Now I had a basis for deciding which courses, regardless of personal interest, would bring me closer to my destination or take me away from it.&nbsp; Simply put, if I wanted to learn Russian, I could not spend my time studying psychology.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, just to review these few points relating to roads and destinations.&nbsp; Both spiritually and temporally, your destinations decree the roads you will walk.&nbsp; Destinations are more than places you wish to be.&nbsp; They represent the deepest of personal aspiration and enliven the roads you walk and give purpose to your lives.&nbsp; The more quickly and surely you can decide upon your destinations, the more defined your road will be.&nbsp; Determine your academic destination as soon as is practical.&nbsp; This decision will bring focus, purpose, and reason to the road of your educational journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second, your every road in life will be a toll road<br /></strong>The attainment of a worthwhile destination, whether spiritual or temporal, comes at a cost and there is never a shortcut to paying it.&nbsp; The Lord revealed that whosoever desires a blessing "shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation of the world."&nbsp;<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;An essential part of success in any area of your life is calculating the cost of achieving it.&nbsp; Thereafter follows the decision regarding the level of your personal commitment in paying the cost.&nbsp; The Lord poses a most interesting question that illustrates this.&nbsp; "For which of you," He asks, "intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?"&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; Money may be the first thing that comes to mind in calculating cost, but it is not the only one. &nbsp;Uncompromising personal commitment to the achievement of a goal is, by far, the greater cost. &nbsp;The road to the completion of your academic degree is charted by the university.&nbsp; The commitment and personal discipline required to walk that road are up to you.&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps these words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow are familiar to you:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The heights by great men reached and kept<br />Were not obtained by sudden flight.<br />But they, while their companions slept,<br />Were toiling upward in the night&nbsp;<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Great destinations are not achieved in a single step or by "sudden flight", but by the accomplishment of numerous smaller or interim goals all along the way.&nbsp; These interim goals should be written down and placed where you can see them often.&nbsp; I recall entering a missionary apartment in Greece and noticing a number taped to the ceiling.&nbsp; When I asked what it was, the missionaries told me that it was their baptismal goal for the month and that they had put it on the ceiling so that it was the first thing they saw each morning when they opened their eyes and the last thing they saw at night before they fell asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The setting and accomplishing of daily goals lead you little by little to your destination.&nbsp; &nbsp;May I give you just a personal example of this? I had finished my qualifying exams and should have been writing my doctoral dissertation, but was not getting to it in a sufficiently serious fashion.&nbsp; One day my chairman called me into his office - hardly ever a pleasant experience - and asked me a very specific question:&nbsp; "Will you write your dissertation this year?" &nbsp;I tried to skirt the question with some very lame excuses.&nbsp; But he kept pressing me.&nbsp; Finally I realized that I had to answer with either a yes or a no.&nbsp; If my answer were "no", I knew that my formal education would be over and that I would never reach my goal, even if I had traversed much of the required road.&nbsp; If my answer were "yes", I knew that I would have to act differently than I had up to that point.&nbsp; I soon realized that he was doing to me what my mission presidents had done.&nbsp; He was trying to get me to make a personal commitment to a specific course of action.&nbsp; When I finally said yes with some conviction, his demeanor changed.&nbsp; He became my mentor instead of my tormentor.&nbsp; "Good", he said, "I will tell you how to do it".&nbsp; Then there came a series of questions:&nbsp; "How many months in a year?"&nbsp; I was a doctoral student and felt that I could answer that one. "Twelve", I answered.&nbsp; He then demanded that I set twelve goals.&nbsp; The next question was: "how many weeks in a month?"&nbsp; To which I answered four.&nbsp; He wanted me to write four goals for each one of the twelve.&nbsp; Then he had me set seven daily goals for each of the four weeks in each month.&nbsp; He knew that if I could complete my goal every single day, that I would complete my dissertation by the end of the year. &nbsp;He then gave me this counsel: "don't go to bed any night until you have completed your daily goal."&nbsp; He was right.&nbsp; I completed each of my daily goals, often without sleep.&nbsp; By the end of the year I was defending my dissertation.&nbsp; It is the constancy of your commitment and personal discipline that bring you to your destinations. &nbsp;&nbsp;The toll required of you is repaid many times over by the fruits of your accomplishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I wish I could say that life were a series of decisions that always turn out as we expect. I am reminded of a little statement I once heard: "good decisions come from wisdom and wisdom comes from bad decisions."&nbsp; Mortality is full of surprises, disappointments, and unexpected intrusions.&nbsp; They will require you to make adjustments along the roads and paths of your lives.&nbsp; Those of you who are close enough to see can observe that I have colorful black eyes and a number of stitches in my forehead.&nbsp; They were the result of an unanticipated accident during a recent windstorm. The accident certainly adjusted my plans for the following few days, but it did not release me from the obligation of my visit with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The adjustments you make are called experience and relate to your eternal journey just as surely as they relate to the many lesser journeys you undertake.&nbsp; Life is an accumulation of such experiences, but experience can be your greatest teacher, if you are wise enough to learn from it.&nbsp; We often hear that a certain tragic experience "changed life forever".&nbsp; But this is not true just of cataclysmic events.&nbsp; It is true of every experience.&nbsp; The thoughts we think, the words we say, and the deeds we do all change our life forever.&nbsp; Once we have undergone experience, we can never return to the exact point when we did not have that experience.&nbsp; When the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins returned from his adventures, Gandalf, the wizard, observed that he was "not the hobbit that you were."&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Experience is meant to enrich you, to make you wiser, more humble, grateful, and more obedient.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"By experience", says Roger Ascham, a classical scholar, "we find out a short way by a long wandering."&nbsp;<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>There may be times in our lives when we wander off the roads we have set for ourselves.&nbsp; When this happens spiritually, the Lord has extended the incomparable blessing of repentance.&nbsp; This gift permits us not only to learn from the experience, but to return to the path from which we wandered.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So, every road is a toll road and the toll is often our personal commitment, perseverance, and discipline.&nbsp; Set and meet good daily goals in order to achieve your destinations in the long term.&nbsp; Adjustments along the road of life are called experience and they will be your most exacting teacher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third, believe in yourself in the face of the challenges along the roads of your life&nbsp;<br /></strong>When I was a little boy, my mother worked for an insurance company.&nbsp; On the walls of her office were a number of motivational statements.&nbsp; One of them said: "doubt whom you may, but never yourself."&nbsp; This little statement made a great impression on my young mind.&nbsp; I memorized it and even yet quote it to myself.&nbsp; It has given me courage in critical moments.&nbsp; There will be many along life's path who will speak words of discouragement to you.&nbsp; When you hear such words, you may begin to believe that you can't measure up or that your gifts and talents are not as good as another's.&nbsp; May I just remind you of what you already know?&nbsp; Each of you is a unique being.&nbsp; No one comes into this life with what is called tabula rasa, that is, with a blank mind that is only written upon by the experiences of this life.&nbsp; Each brings forgotten experiences, inclinations, gifts, talents, and abilities that have been developing since the moment of creation.&nbsp; Your mortal experience, of course, draws upon them and your education enhances, fortifies, and further disciplines them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the great challenges of your life is to discover your own uniqueness and to develop it.&nbsp; The Lord revealed that "To every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.&nbsp; To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.&nbsp;<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;Each of you has something that is uniquely your own - something that distinguishes you from all others.&nbsp; There is no reason to think that you must be exactly like someone else.&nbsp; You would do well to remember the counsel of Ralph Waldo Emerson who said: "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."&nbsp;<sup>10&nbsp;</sup>(End of quote) &nbsp;When you envy others their gift, or feel that you somehow must have one exactly like it, you will miss the beauty, strength, and power of our own gift.&nbsp; You will miss the uniqueness that Heavenly Father put in you.&nbsp; Don't waste your time trying to act, speak, or dress like someone else.&nbsp; Your time is better spent focusing on, and developing, your own abilities and talents.&nbsp; This takes courage.&nbsp; It also takes a willingness to try many things and to fail at some.&nbsp; It takes introspection and education.&nbsp; But in the end, it is those who have discovered their own uniqueness and who have developed it, who make lasting contributions to the goodness of the world.&nbsp; The more you develop your gift and the more you discipline it, the richer we all are.&nbsp;<br /><br />When the road gets hard, which it inevitably does, your first inclination might be to turn back or even "to go home."&nbsp; In the midst of their wanderings the Children of Israel looked back longingly to the predictable, but fruitless, life in Egypt.&nbsp; Leman, Lemuel, and a few others of Lehi's party wanted to return to their familiar surroundings in Jerusalem.&nbsp; Even God's assurance that a Promised Land lay at the end of their road did not dissuade them. &nbsp;In the difficulties of your mortal journeys you may at times wish that you could return to your heavenly home, as you might to the comfort and predictability of your childhood home.&nbsp; But anyone who has gone back to a childhood home knows that you can't go forward by going back.&nbsp; Once you commence a journey the only way home is in front of you, never behind you.&nbsp; It is paradoxical, is it not, that the only way for you to return home to Heavenly Father is by going forward, beginning from where you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My brothers and sisters, even when you are firmly in "the right way"<sup>12</sup>, as Moroni writes, and moving toward your destinations there are times that you may feel lost and insecure.&nbsp; These are the moments that you cling to the iron rod more firmly.&nbsp; Heavenly Father has not forgotten you.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please realize that He has destinations in mind for you that you may not at the moment recognize. Believe in yourself and in your own uniqueness.&nbsp; Bring your gift forward for the benefit of the world. &nbsp;Move forward with faith and determination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fourth, learn to enjoy the journey<br /></strong>I&nbsp;say "learn" because not all of us naturally enjoy a difficult road.&nbsp; Our inclination is often to make things easier.&nbsp; Journeys, by their very nature, are not always short, easy, or pleasant particularly if they lead to the Promised Land.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand the scriptures are full of the admonition to be happy.&nbsp; When Lehi partook of the fruit of the Tree of Life, he found that it filled his soul "with exceedingly great joy."&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp; Lehi's journey was anything but easy.&nbsp; Yet, his teachings confirm that God intends, through the Atonement of Christ, that His children feel His confirming love and the joy that comes from partaking fully of the Tree of Life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only as we near the end of a journey do we truly see its great worth to us.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is then that we see what experience has taught us.&nbsp; It is then that we are most grateful.&nbsp; I have found that there is great satisfaction in accomplishment, but greater joy in the successes along the way.&nbsp; Perhaps Cervantes had this in mind also when in the 1500's he wrote: "The road is better than the Inn."&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp; When my grandmother was nearing her death, my brother asked her what it was like to have lived 95 years.&nbsp; Her answer was simple.&nbsp; "It has been like a single day."&nbsp; So it is with our journeys.&nbsp; We can look forward to them with anticipation and, in the midst of them may think they will never end.&nbsp; But finally, when we come to our destination, our road will seem like a single day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br /></strong>Just in summary:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The destination you choose will determine the road you take.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your every road in life will be a toll road.&nbsp;<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Believe in yourself in the face of the challenges along the roads of your life.<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn to enjoy the journey.</p>
<p>I encourage you to have faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; It will bring you peace and comfort.&nbsp; Have faith in your testimony.&nbsp; It will provide you with spiritual strength.&nbsp; Have faith in the living apostles and prophets.&nbsp; It will bring you guidance in our present world.&nbsp; Make your decisions with fasting and prayer.&nbsp; It will move you forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emeritus Member, First Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p>Elder William R. Walker was called as a General Authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 2002. He served in the Second Quorum of the Seventy for six years. On April 6, 2008, he was named a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. He served as the Executive Director of the Temple Department from 2007 to 2014. As Executive Director, he worked closely with the First Presidency in the oversight and administration of the Church's many temples throughout the world. In October 2014 he was released as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy and was designated as an emeritus General Authority.&nbsp; <br /><br /> Elder Walker was raised in Raymond, Alberta, Canada, and served a mission in Japan as a young man. He is a graduate of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. During his career, he held a number of executive positions with major firms in the securities and investment banking fields.<br /><br /> Elder Walker has served as the Area President of the Asia North Area in Tokyo, Japan. Prior to his call as a General Authority, he was president of the Japan Tokyo South Mission and also served as a stake president and bishop.&nbsp; <br /><br /> William R. Walker was born in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, on May 25, 1944. He married Vicki Van Wagenen in 1968. They are the parents of five children.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the invitation to speak at BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />In 1966, I finished serving my mission in Japan, and I came to school at Ricks College.&nbsp; I loved it here, and know there is a wonderful Spirit here on your campus.<br /><br />I am grateful to President Clark Gilbert for his warm welcome.<br /><br />Today, I will speak about why the temple is so important to every Latter-day Saint.<br /><br /><strong>The Great Plan of Happiness</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Any observer of the Latter-day Saint culture will quickly conclude that the temple has a unique and very special place in the lives of our people.<br /><br />Fundamental to our feelings about the importance of the temple is our understanding of the Doctrine of God's Plan of Happiness for us.&nbsp; Some call it the Plan of Salvation.&nbsp; Alma called it "the Great Plan of Happiness." (Alma 42:8)<br /><br />Essential to our understanding of God's plan for us is to know that God lives, that He loves us, and that He provided a Savior for us.<br /><br />Every Latter-day Saint believes that they are children of a loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp; Every Latter-day Saint believes that life is eternal.<br /><br />Every Latter-day Saint believes that God's plan for us includes the provision that we can return to Him.&nbsp; Central to that plan, of course, is the fact that God provided a Savior for us.&nbsp; Through the Son of God, the Savior Jesus Christ, we can overcome the world and find our way back to Heaven.<br /><br />The temple is essential to all of this.<br /><br /><strong>The Prophet Joseph Smith - Temples and The Restoration</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught early in his ministry the importance of the temple and the temple ordinances.&nbsp; Joseph's teachings and doctrines were unique to the religious world of that day.&nbsp; When Joseph spoke of the need for temples and temple ordinances, those concepts were not subjects that were part of religious discussions of that day.<br /><br />The Restoration, of course, provided that there would be a restoration of all things, including temples, temple ordinances, and temple worship.<br /><br />These things were revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith. He taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We calculate to give the Elders of Israel their washings and anointings, and attend to those last and more impressive ordinances, without which we cannot obtain celestial thrones."&nbsp; (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 362)</p>
<p>Joseph taught, "There must be a holy place prepared for that purpose." (Ibid. p.362)</p>
<p>As he continued to teach of the importance of building temples, Joseph taught that we needed a place "for men to be baptized for their dead", and where they "may receive their endowments and be made kings and priests (queens and priestesses) unto the Most High God."&nbsp; (Ibid. p. 363)<br /><br />As you know, temples were built in Kirtland, Ohio and Nauvoo, Illinois.&nbsp; Some of you may enjoy studying these matters in more detail in Sections 109, and 110 of the Doctrine and Covenants, and the first 55 verses of Section 124.<br /><br /><strong>Look to the Temple as the Great Symbol of our Membership</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>President Howard W. Hunter was president of the Church when some of you were born. &nbsp;He died in 1995.&nbsp; When he was president of the Church he challenged us to "look to the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of our membership." (Conference Report, October 1994)<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>What a wonderful challenge he gave us.&nbsp; Probably many of you have already done this: You look to the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of your membership in the Church.&nbsp; It is the Lord's Church. &nbsp;The temple is the house of the Lord.&nbsp; The temple&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;be a great symbol of our membership in the Church.<br /><br />Every Latter-day Saint knows he is on his way back to God.&nbsp; We know that this life is temporary, although very important.&nbsp; We know that God gave us the temples as a means to find our way back.<br /><br />What a blessing it is for us to live in a day when temples now dot the earth.&nbsp; With the recent dedication of Cordoba Argentina Temple, and the upcoming dedication of the Payson Utah Temple, we will have 146 operating temples throughout the world.&nbsp; It is marvelous time to be a member of the Church.<br /><br />In the seven years since President Monson became president of the Church, he has overseen the dedication of 22 temples, the rededication of 7 refurbished temples and he has announced plans for another 27 temples to be built.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some are nearing completion and will be dedicated soon.<br /><br />At April General Conference, President Monson thrilled the saints in the Ivory Coast, Haiti, and Thailand, when he announced a temple would be built in each of those countries.&nbsp; When all the temples that President Monson has announced are dedicated, we will have 173 temples throughout the earth.<br /><br />Every Latter-day Saint knows that the ordinances of the temple are essential for us, and our loved ones, in order to avail ourselves of all the blessings that our Father in Heaven has in store for us. &nbsp;As I mentioned a moment ago, the Prophet Joseph Smith spoke of "celestial thrones."&nbsp; That is what our loving Heavenly Father has in store for us.<br /><br /><strong>Children and Temples</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The temple is very important in the lives of Latter-day Saint children.&nbsp; As children, we identify with the temple. &nbsp;Why is that?&nbsp; I suppose in part it is because children innately feel close to Father in Heaven, and the temple is the house of the Lord.<br /><br />As the poet Wordsworth eloquently wrote of our birth, with this expression: "Trailing clouds of glory do we come from God, who is our home...."<br /><br />Things of a spiritual nature are not so far removed from us in our early years.&nbsp; Children, who are not yet affected by worldly things, are more sensitive to the things of the spirit.&nbsp; Think how often Jesus taught that we must become as children.<br /><br />At one of the temple open houses, a little boy was in his father's arms as the family visited the celestial room.&nbsp; After a few sacred moments of reflection for all of the family, the father and mother turned to leave.&nbsp; The little boy in his father's arms looked heavenward, smiled and then waved goodbye.&nbsp; It was a tender moment for me.</p>
<p>Years ago, the prophet Spencer W. Kimball suggested that every young Latter-day Saint ought to have a picture of the temple in their bedroom.&nbsp; Probably many of you had just such a picture - a picture of your&nbsp;favorite temple.&nbsp; It may have hung on the wall in your room, or sat in a strategic place on your dresser.&nbsp; It may have been the temple closest to where you lived, or another temple that had special significance to you, such as the temple where your parents or grandparents were married.&nbsp; Or it could have been a temple that you found to be particularly beautiful and inspiring.</p>
<p>You are here in Rexburg, attending university, and it could well be that the nearby magnificent and beautiful Rexburg Temple has become your favorite temple.<br /><br />The architecture and the surrounding beauty of each temple may differ, but the ordinances are the same in every temple.&nbsp; Whether it is the Temple in Accra, Ghana, or the Temple in Seoul Korea, the ordinances and the promised blessings&nbsp;are exactly the same.<br /><br />It is interesting to me that children, who may have never been inside a temple, can hold it in such high esteem and great affection.&nbsp; Latter-day Saint children sing the song: "I love to see the temple, I'm going there someday."<br /><br />As a child I grew to love the temple.&nbsp; I lived in Raymond, Alberta, Canada.&nbsp; Our home was about 35 miles from the Cardston Alberta Temple.&nbsp; I loved to see the temple; I knew I was going there someday.&nbsp; Our family often stopped at the temple and took family pictures in front of the temple.&nbsp; Even before I was old enough to figure out very many things, I knew that the temple was very important to my mother and father and to my grandparents.<br /><br />I remember sitting on the floor in the dining room and watching my mother iron her temple clothing.&nbsp; She would tell me that, "Tonight is temple night, and your father and I are so happy to be going to the temple."&nbsp; She was setting an important example for me.<br /><br />I have been with President Thomas S. Monson at temple dedications when he has suggested that when little children come to see the temple, they go right up to the side of the temple, and actually touch it.&nbsp; He said: "When they touch the temple, the temple will touch them."<br /><br />When you have children, you will feel the importance of teaching them about the temple.&nbsp; You will want to be an example, and go to the temple often.&nbsp; Your children will realize the importance of the temple in your life.&nbsp; Few things that you teach them could be more important.<br /><br />President Boyd K. Packer taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Point your children toward the temple.&nbsp; From the days of their infancy, direct their attention to it, and begin their preparation for the day when they may enter the Holy temple." (The Holy Temple, p.47)</p>
<p>As your children go to Primary, Sunday School, Mutual, and Seminary, they will be taught about the importance of the temple.&nbsp; You want your children to listen to those lessons, and have the feeling in their heart: "This is all good, and I already know how important the temple is to my mother and father."</p>
<p>Sister Walker and I have five children.&nbsp; When the children were little we had some exciting family home evenings. &nbsp;We found it helpful to keep lots of pictures of temples as well as Bible and Book of Mormon pictures to help in teaching lessons. We would bring out the big stack of pictures each family home evening.</p>
<p>Each child would select a picture to show during their part of the lesson.&nbsp; The children would often choose a temple picture and they would say: "This is the Salt Lake Temple.&nbsp; This is where Daddy and Mommy were married."&nbsp;&nbsp; Or,&nbsp; "This is the Idaho Falls Temple, we stopped there on our vacation."&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the pictures in the stack was a picture of the Sacred Grove.&nbsp; One evening our son chose the Sacred Grove picture.&nbsp; I was very pleased, and thought our little guy would tell us the story of the First Vision.&nbsp; When he stood up, he said: "This is the Sacred Grove, This is where Joseph Smith chopped down the trees, and built a temple."<br /><br />It was fun and we were able to gently straighten things out.&nbsp;&nbsp; We knew our children were learning.&nbsp; As the years went by, every one of them married in the temple.<br /><br />An 8-year-old baptized member can attend a temple dedication, but generally, our youth are not able to be in the temple until they reach age 12.&nbsp; They are then able to go to the temple and perform the sacred ordinance of being baptized for their deceased ancestors.<br /><br />This practice can continue throughout the teenage years and will be a source of great blessings for our youth.<br /><br /><strong>The Spirit of Elijah</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In a remarkable talk in General Conference in October 2011, Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve, challenged the young people of the Church to not just go to the temple to do Baptisms, but to learn about and experience the Spirit of Elijah.</p>
<p>Elder Bednar said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I encourage you to study, to search out your ancestors, and to prepare yourselves to perform proxy baptisms in the house of the Lord for your kindred dead."&nbsp; (Conference Report, October/2011)</p>
<p>In his wonderful message, Elder Bednar promised the youth of the Church these blessings if they followed his counsel:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.Your Patriarchal Blessing will become more meaningful to you.<br />2. Your love and gratitude for your ancestors will increase.<br />3. Your testimony of the Savior will become deep and abiding.<br />4. You will be protected against the intensifying influence of the adversary.<br />5. You will be safeguarded in your youth and throughout your lives.</p>
<p>Every member of the Church should want these blessings.</p>
<p><strong>Sealings - Families Can Be Together Forever</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We learn that families can be together forever.&nbsp; That is accomplished by living God's commandments and by making and keeping sacred temple covenants.&nbsp; A loving Heavenly Father would want his children to be sealed together for time and for all eternity.&nbsp; "Until death do us part" has very little appeal for those who love each other with all their hearts.</p>
<p>When a cousin of mine was killed in a tragic accident, my parents comforted us by teaching about the blessings of the temple, the significance of the sealing and how a loving Heavenly Father would make everything right.&nbsp; It still hurt, but not quite as much.<br /><br />When a grandparent passes away, you wonder how the surviving companion is going to deal with the grief and loneliness.&nbsp; They realize that they have been sealed in the temple for time and all eternity and therefore they have the assurance that they will be together again.<br /><br />This comfort and reassurance comes to every Latter-day Saint.&nbsp; I was blessed to be with President Gordon B. Hinckley in Korea in 2005, shortly after Sister Hinckley had died.&nbsp; In his talk to all of the Saints in Korea who had assembled in a special conference to commemorate the 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary of the Church in Korea, President Hinckley spoke lovingly and tenderly of his wife.&nbsp; Everyone there was touched by his tender expressions of love for Sister Hinckley.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said: "We went to the temple, and we knelt at the altar, and we were sealed for time and for all eternity.&nbsp; She is mine and I am hers, and it won't be long until we are together again."</p>
<p><strong>The Endowment - A Gift from God<br /></strong><strong>The Temple is a Place of Revelation and Peace</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The temple is important to us because of what we learn when we participate in the temple ordinances.&nbsp; We all know that "the temple is a place of revelation and peace." (Howard W. Hunter, Conference Report, October 1994)<br /><br />"As we attend the temple we learn more richly and deeply the purpose of life and the significance of the atoning sacrifice of the Lord, Jesus Christ." (Howard W. Hunter, ibid.)<br /><br />As we attend the temple we are reminded of the beauty of God's creations.&nbsp; Many of the temples have magnificent murals, which depict the beauty of this world.&nbsp; We are reminded of God's plan for us, the role of the Savior in each of our lives, and we are reminded of the commandments and blessings that will come to us when we live righteously and keep the covenants that we make in the temple.<br /><br />The endowment really is a gift from God.&nbsp; It keeps giving and giving, just as the traditional use of the word endowment implies.<br /><br />We live in a hectic world, a world filled with influences that will keep us away from righteousness. &nbsp;Going to the temple is a way of stepping out of the world for a few moments, or a few hours.&nbsp; When we make time to go to the temple, we will be spiritually refreshed.&nbsp; If our life has lost important balance, being in the temple can help restore that balance.<br /><br />Those who stay worthy of the temple, and who participate in temple worship regularly, are far more likely to stay spiritually balanced and live in harmony with the teaching of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; They are far more likely to manifest "godly walk and conversation", and they are more likely to be "walking in holiness before the Lord."&nbsp; (DC 20:69)<br /><br />President Packer taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It has been my observation that the temple transforms&nbsp;the individual and makes abundantly worthwhile any efforts made to get there."&nbsp; (The Holy Temple, p. 21)</p>
<p>I have a smart phone, which has an app that is a compass.&nbsp; Occasionally, the compass gets out of balance and needs to be recalibrated.&nbsp; The instructions tell me to take the phone and move it in a figure-eight motion, repeating several times - after which, the compass will once again work correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I feel that my spiritual compass is a little out of balance, I have found the very best way to recalibrate is not to quickly run around in a figure-eight pattern, but to go to the temple.&nbsp; For me, it works every time.<br /><br />Being in the temple will give us important perspective - spiritual perspective and eternal perspective. &nbsp;Our burdens will be lightened, not because they change, but because the spiritual strength and perspective that we gain will assist us in dealing with them.<br /><br />Additionally, we are entitled to revelation and guidance from the Spirit.&nbsp; For me and many of our people, we feel an increased measure of direction from Heaven when we are in the temple.<br /><br />Most devout Latter-day Saints want to go to the temple when they are faced with an important decision in life.&nbsp; Not because they will talk to anyone about it, but because they will look to Heaven for guidance and direction with the confidence that they'll receive important inspiration and revelation.&nbsp; We expect to leave the temple with feelings that will help guide us.<br /><br />I heard of a cynical man who thought it was just incredulous that Latter-day Saints thought they could actually receive answers to their prayers, that God would actually communicate with them somehow.&nbsp; Well, I testify that revelation is real and available to God's children and we seem to receive an increased measure of that direction from Heaven when we are in the temple.<br /><br />We all need to remember that when we were baptized, we were also confirmed and we received the gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Current Temple Recommend</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I love the expression of Elder Russell M. Nelson, of the Quorum of the Twelve, who said that for our children CTR is a reminder to Choose The Right, but for us adults, it should be a reminder of Current Temple Recommend.<br /><br />Just as our youth are reminded to choose the right, we need reminders to keep our temple recommend current and to have the temple and temple worship be an essential part of our lives.<br /><br />I once heard someone say that their recommend was "slightly out of date."&nbsp; I was astonished at the rationalization that led the person to feel that since it hadn't been long since their recommend had expired, that it was not so bad. An expired recommend is not a valid recommend regardless of how recently it expired.&nbsp; It would be a worthy goal for every one of us to never let our temple recommend expire - we ought to renew our recommend well before it has a chance to become "slightly out of date."<br /><br />Many years ago, a man in my stake was dying from cancer.&nbsp; He was a good, faithful High Priest.&nbsp; His Bishop called me on the phone and said: "President Walker, Brother Bolyard is bed-ridden and near the end of his life.&nbsp; His recommend will soon expire and he would like to renew it.&nbsp; He can't come to the office, so I would like to go to his home to give him his interview.&nbsp; Would you be willing to accompany me?"<br /><br />Gladly, I went to the man's home with the Bishop.&nbsp; In turn, we each asked him the temple recommend questions, and signed his recommend.&nbsp; When I handed it to him, he smiled and said: "Thank you, President.&nbsp; I'm going to put it right here on my night stand, so that when they come to get me, they'll know I have a current temple recommend."<br /><br />I was deeply impressed with the faith and devotion of this wonderful man.&nbsp; Each of us would be wise to follow his example - always have a current temple recommend.<br /><br /><strong>How Important?&nbsp; No Sacrifice is Too Great</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>When we consider how important is the temple in the life of every Latter-day Saint, I think it is wise to consider the words of President Thomas S. Monson.<br /><br />In his General Conference message in April 2011, President Monson made a powerful and poignant expression on the importance of the temple in our lives:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Those who understand the eternal blessings that come from the temple know that no sacrifice is too great, no price too heavy, no struggle too difficult in order to receive (our temple) blessings. There are never too many miles to travel, too many obstacles to overcome, or too much discomfort to endure.&nbsp; They understand that the saving ordinances received in the temple that permit us to someday return to our Heavenly Father in an eternal family relationship and to be endowed with blessings and power from on high are worth every sacrifice and every effort." (Conference Report, April/2011, p. 81)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Testimony</strong></p>
<p>The temple is so important in the life of every Latter-day Saint, because we know it is what our Father in Heaven wants for us.&nbsp;The temple is so important because we know that Jesus Christ's atonement is paramount in each of our lives and the blessings that we receive through keeping our temple covenants will bring joy and happiness in this life and throughout eternity.&nbsp;The temple is so important because we know that the sealing in the temple truly enables Families to Be Together Forever.<br /><br />May each of us make the temple the great symbol of our membership.&nbsp;May the temple help us to always remember Him.&nbsp;May the temple help us to love the Lord and to keep His commandments.<br /><br />I know that as we make the temple more important in our lives, we will draw nearer to God and we will become more like Him.&nbsp;I express my love to each of you and appreciate you being here today.&nbsp;I pray God's most choice blessings for you, the blessings of the temple, the house of the Lord.<br /><br />In the holy and sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>It is always wonderful to gather for devotional.&nbsp; I am grateful to have the opportunity and responsibility to speak to you in this setting.&nbsp; It truly is a humbling experience and I have sought the direction of the Holy Ghost in my preparation.&nbsp; I would also invite you to pray for the Holy Ghost's influence to be with us today, that we might be edified by what is said, and what is felt.<br /><br />From the time that I was a student at Ricks College until now, I have attended many devotionals in this building.&nbsp; Other than the number of students and the need to broadcast to other buildings, not too much has changed over the years.&nbsp; In the old days when I was a student, we would come to devotional, save seats for friends and roommates and hope that our family home evening sisters would sit by us.&nbsp; Although that was many years ago, I remember clearly sitting where you are sitting.&nbsp; I also remember that occasionally my mind wandered and I would think about what I would teach if I was ever given the assignment to be the devotional speaker.&nbsp; I certainly was not aspiring to ever be the speaker and as I sat there where you are sitting, I certainly did not believe that me standing behind this podium speaking to you would ever be a reality.&nbsp; However, I believe God knew it could happen and that He guided the circumstances and gave me opportunities to prepare for this experience and to perform this service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as I did not anticipate the assignment that I have received today, we seldom anticipate, when we are young, the Church assignments that we will be asked to fulfill.&nbsp; I doubt most bishops, relief society presidents, stake presidents, young women presidents or even general authorities expected to be filling these roles when they were twenty years old.&nbsp; Having said that, I believe God does have callings and assignments in mind for each of his children.&nbsp; Much of what God has in mind are experiences that you are already aware of and fully expect to accomplish, such as serving a fulltime mission, marrying in the temple, and having a family.&nbsp;In many cases however, He has assignments in mind for you that you, at this point in your life, can hardly imagine that you would, or could, ever be capable of fulfilling.&nbsp; Someday it could be you standing behind this podium.&nbsp; I hope you realize that He has much for you to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The key to accomplishing what God would have you do in this life is to begin to prepare now, not with an attitude of aspiring to great heights in the Kingdom, but with the spirit of desiring to be ready to be an instrument in his hands regardless of what it is that He asks of you.&nbsp; My objective today is to invite you to prepare now for the service that God has in mind for you to perform.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Although each individual has specifically tailored missions, in the gospel the process of preparing to fulfill these missions, and becoming instruments in God's hands, does not require that we know the specifics of all that God has in mind for us.&nbsp; The process of preparing to be a sunbeam teacher or a seventy is very similar; in fact from the perspective of a college-age student it is essentially identical.&nbsp; This process requires a motivation based upon faith that the Lord needs you.&nbsp; This process requires looking forward with an "eye of faith" to be ready to serve whenever and wherever you are needed. &nbsp;As you prepare to serve, there are four principles I invite you to incorporate into your life, or to incorporate more deeply into your life, that I feel are essential to your preparation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First, Pray Frequently and Fervently<br /></strong>First, pray frequently and fervently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am confident that the vast majority here are in the habit of praying regularly.&nbsp; However, I am not as confident that, for the majority, this regular prayer includes night and morning prayer.&nbsp; Prayer is our opportunity to maintain a constant connection with our Father in Heaven.&nbsp; Are you making the time and taking the time to maintain this connection?&nbsp; Alma encouraged us to pray about everything in our lives. (Alma 34:17-27)&nbsp; Christ invited, "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:&nbsp; For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened." (Matt 7:7-8) It may be difficult to be perfect in all aspects of prayer, but there is one aspect of prayer that I know we can perform to perfection right now and for the rest of our lives.&nbsp; Each of us can be perfect in this so I am going to invite you to be perfect, in this one thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Here's the invitation:&nbsp; I invite you to never go a day, for the rest of your life, without saying a personal, kneeling morning and evening prayer.&nbsp; You can be perfect in doing this one thing.&nbsp; If you are, I am confident you will receive great blessings because of it.&nbsp; To be successful in the short term, you may need to take special measures to remind yourself.&nbsp; For instance, you may need to place the traditional big rock, or the carpet square stenciled with the word prayer that you made at a primary activity day, next to your bed for a prayer reminder when you crawl in and out of bed.&nbsp; Do whatever it takes to start and end every day with personal, kneeling prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Henry B. Eyring taught,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"...it is clear how often we should speak to God: regularly in words, continually in feelings.&nbsp; When the Savior appeared among the people on this continent, after his resurrection, he taught them how to pray.&nbsp; He used the words, "Pray always." That doesn't mean now and then.&nbsp; It doesn't mean to pray only when you feel like it.&nbsp; Listen to what he said to them:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>'Therefore blessed are ye if ye shall keep my commandments, which the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you.<br /></em><em>'Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him.<br /></em><em>'And as I have prayed among you even so shall ye pray in my church, among my people who do repent and are baptized in my name.&nbsp; Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.'&nbsp; (3 Nephi 18:14-16)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Now, you and I need to listen with great care.&nbsp; When you heard the scripture I just recited, you heard the words of Christ.&nbsp; I testify that is true.&nbsp; Jesus Christ speaks the words of the Father.&nbsp; You can read the scriptures, listen, and then hear God's answers to you."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Henry B. Eyring, "To Draw Closer to God," Ensign, May 1991, 65)</em></p>
<p>Please heed Christ's counsel to "pray always."&nbsp;<br /><br />As you pray frequently, also make the effort to pray fervently.&nbsp; From personal experience, we all know that it is possible to talk to someone without actually having a conversation with that person.&nbsp; Likewise, it is possible to say our prayers without really praying.&nbsp; If we pray just to pray, or pray without listening for an answer, there is room for improvement, and we should make efforts to improve.&nbsp; Fervent prayer is communication with our Father.&nbsp; Communication takes effort.&nbsp; When we fervently pray, we share our feelings and perspective with our Father and seek his direction in aligning our life and our will with his purposes for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now back to the theme of my talk, in the process of preparing to serve God, prayer is critical.&nbsp; Satan and his servants will do all that is within their power to cause you to stumble.&nbsp; When we stumble spiritually, we limit our ability to serve God.&nbsp; Prayer is essential in fortifying your life against the temptations of the adversary.&nbsp; There are many scriptures, such as the two I will share, that illustrate this principle.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work." (D&amp;C 10:5)<br /></em><em>"...humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit" (Alma 13:28)</em></p>
<p>I am convinced that one of the most important elements of finding strength to conqueror Satan, and resist his temptations, is sincere prayer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Preparing to serve God requires that we develop the ability to communicate with Him through prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Study the Scriptures<br /></strong>My second invitation is to place a greater emphasis upon scripture study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I have always been a daily scripture reader.&nbsp; I believe that there is strength in reading the scriptures daily and I believe I have been blessed for my efforts.&nbsp; I hope all of you are also daily scripture readers. &nbsp;However, the true power of the scriptures comes from searching and pondering.&nbsp; During the periods in my life when I have truly studied, not just read, the scriptures, I have been truly blessed by the scriptures. &nbsp;Nephi invites us to,&nbsp;<em>"feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do." (2 Nephi 32:3)</em>&nbsp; Are you "feasting" on the "words of Christ" that are written in the scriptures, or is your scripture study more of an occasional snack?&nbsp;<br /><br />Prophets of God receive inspiration facilitated by scripture study.&nbsp; Joseph Smith prayed in the grove that became sacred as a result of his pondering upon James 1:5.&nbsp; Pondering upon a scripture and subsequently receiving divine instruction was a pattern he followed throughout his life.&nbsp; Joseph F. Smith received the revelation that is now Doctrine and Covenants section 138 as he pondered upon the writings of Peter.&nbsp; Truly studying the scriptures can open the channels of revelation in our personal lives.&nbsp; To be effective servants of our Father in Heaven, we need the avenue of revelation that studying and pondering the scriptures provides.&nbsp;<br /><br />To be effective servants of our Father in Heaven, we also need to obtain the knowledge that studying the scriptures provides.&nbsp; The scriptures contain true doctrine.&nbsp; In serving, you will need to be able to recognize false doctrine and teach true doctrine.&nbsp; Recall that Nehor was a false teacher who attempted to establish priestcrafts among the Nephites at the beginning of Alma's reign as chief judge. (Alma 1:4-9)&nbsp; Nehor's message is summarized in Alma 1:4 where it says,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And he also testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life."</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is evident that Nehor wanted the Nephites to believe that there was no sin, and therefore no eternal consequences for their actions.&nbsp; Many did believe Nehor's words, they even supported him financially.&nbsp; Why didn't these people recognize that Nehor was a fraud whose objective was to distort the word of God?&nbsp; The answer is that the people he deceived were not grounded upon the word of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Nehor's success ended when he met Gideon.&nbsp; Gideon confounded Nehor because he&nbsp;<em>"admonished him with the words of God" (Alma 1:7)</em>and&nbsp;<em>"withstood him with the words of God." (Alma 1:9)</em>&nbsp; Because of the power of Gideon's knowledge of the "words of God", Nehor's deception came to an end and, in fact, his life even came to end as he suffered an&nbsp;<em>"ignominious death".</em>&nbsp;(Alma 1:15)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You will all face Nehor like influences in your lives.&nbsp; In fact we all know, or know of, individuals today who accept and promote Nehor's doctrine, which is Satan's doctrine.&nbsp; Your ability to be like Gideon and to recognize and overcome these influences in your own life, and to assist others in doing the same, will rest largely on the knowledge and testimony that you gain through studying the scriptures.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To some, studying the scriptures and praying can seem like overly simplistic solutions to the difficult challenges that we face in life. &nbsp;Please don't underestimate the power of linking frequent fervent prayer and scripture study.&nbsp; Alma taught that&nbsp;<em>"by small and simple things are great things brought to pass" (Alma 37:6).</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Prayer and scripture study may seem like small and simple things but they are the lifeline to our Father in Heaven. &nbsp;President Howard W. Hunter put it this way,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"There may be so very much our Father in Heaven would like to give us--young, old, or middle-aged--if we would but seek his presence regularly through such avenues as scripture study and earnest prayer." (Howard W. Hunter, "Blessed from on High," Ensign, Nov. 1988, 59)</em></p>
<p><strong>Repent Regularly<br /></strong>My third invitation is to repent regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when we make our best efforts to live the gospel, we fall short of perfection and have the need to regularly repent.&nbsp; If you don't think you have anything to repent of, you are kidding yourself.&nbsp; John said, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." (1 John 1:8)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I had an experience on my mission that reminded me of the importance of regular repentance.&nbsp; Toward the end of my mission, a member of the Quorum of the Seventy went to Hawaii, where I was serving.&nbsp; Although his primary purpose in going to Hawaii was not related to our Mission, he took a few hours one afternoon to teach a small group of missionaries. &nbsp;I was fortunate to be able to attend that meeting.&nbsp; He taught many things, but one principle stood out to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />He made a comment that day that had an immediate impact on my understanding of my need for repentance.&nbsp; I remember him saying something like, "The greatest blessings I have received in my life are in proportion to the extent to which I have repented of my sins."&nbsp; When he said this, I was immediately humbled by the realization that I had spent close to two years teaching repentance without regularly analyzing my own life for those things that I needed to repent of.&nbsp; Perhaps I justified repenting less on my mission because, in many respects, I probably was more righteous during this time than I had ever been before my mission.&nbsp; I could have rationalized that I had less to repent of.&nbsp; However, I realized that day that if a general authority taught the principle of repentance by describing the importance of repentance in his life, I needed to reevaluate the application of repentance in my own life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As I analyzed my life and began to repent of the seemingly small things I needed to repent of, I saw immediate miracles in my missionary service.&nbsp; At the time, I was serving in the mission office which made proselyting difficult.&nbsp; We did not have many opportunities to teach, but no sooner did I begin to apply repentance again in my life than a mother, who had committed to turn her life around, called and asked that we teach her unbaptized children.&nbsp; We also had an elementary school teacher, who was not a member of our Church, come to our office and asked that we spend an hour teaching his class the history of our Church.&nbsp; Unfortunately my mission ended shortly after I learned this powerful personal lesson on repentance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My invitation is for you to evaluate your need for repentance now and throughout your life.&nbsp; The Lord has blessings in store for us that we will only be worthy to receive if we repent of our sins, both large and small.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Smith had an experience that illustrates this principle.&nbsp; You recall that at the time that Moroni first appeared to Joseph Smith, Joseph was praying for forgiveness of his sins.&nbsp; In his own words Joseph said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me that I might know of my state and standing before him." (JSH 1:29)</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of his prayer, Moroni appeared to Joseph, Joseph was taught, and the Book of Mormon was unveiled.&nbsp; I do not think that it is a coincidence that Moroni was sent to Joseph on the night that Joseph sought forgiveness.&nbsp; I believe Joseph received this manifestation as he sought to be worthy through repentance.&nbsp; Consider that he was not seeking forgiveness for serious sins.&nbsp; In his own words,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...no one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins.&nbsp; A disposition to commit such was never in my nature.&nbsp; But I was guilty of levity, and sometimes associated with jovial company." (JSH 1:28)</p>
<p>It is important to note that Joseph was repenting of "levity" and association with "jovial company." Joseph's need for repentance was real even though his sins were relatively small.&nbsp; The blessings Joseph received as he repented of these seemingly insignificant sins were remarkable and continue to bless us even today.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma taught,&nbsp;<em>"cast off your sins, and do not procrastinate the day of your repentance." (Alma 13: 27)&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;Regardless of the level of transgression, repentance is required when we sin.&nbsp; If the level of transgression requires that you involve your bishop, such as in the case of moral transgressions including the viewing of pornography, don't hesitate to take that step.&nbsp; Start the process of repenting now, the sooner you start, the sooner you will begin to realize the blessings.&nbsp; Remember that the blessings you receive will be proportionate to the level of your repentance.&nbsp; Don't prevent your Father in Heaven from blessing you with opportunities to serve and grow because you are overlooking current or past transgressions.&nbsp; God's promises are sure; when we repent he will forgive us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.&nbsp; By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them." (D&amp;C 58:42-43)</em></p>
<p>Now, back to the theme of my message, your Father in Heaven has much for you to do.&nbsp; Repenting sincerely and regularly will allow you to be worthy of the blessing of being an instrument in his hands. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Develop Charity<br /></strong>Finally, my fourth invitation for you is to seek to more fully develop charity in your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without charity, you will fall short of fulfilling your mission in life.&nbsp; In reality, acting upon the first three invitations I have made today will mean nothing if we fail to act on the invitation to develop charity.&nbsp; Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 13:1-2, 13:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or as tinkling cymbal."<br />"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing."&nbsp;<br />"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity."</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks has said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The reason charity never fails and the reason charity is greater than even the most significant acts of goodness he cited is that charity, 'the pure love of Christ'</em>&nbsp;(Moro. 7:<em>47), is not an act but a condition or state of being.&nbsp; Charity is attained through a succession of acts that result in a conversion.&nbsp; Charity is something one becomes." (Dallin H. Oaks, "The Challenge to Become," Ensign, Nov. 2000, 32-34)</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is interesting that Elder Oaks has the perspective that, "Charity is something one becomes."&nbsp; Are you becoming charity?&nbsp; Is the pure love of Christ evident in your life?&nbsp;<br /><br />Doctrine and Covenants 88:125 states,&nbsp;<em>"Above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with a mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace."</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />Despite the emphasis that these and many other scriptures place on charity, I am not sure we give charity the attention it deserves.&nbsp; I believe that at times we treat charity as a characteristic that we either have or we do not have, as if some people have charity and others probably never will.&nbsp; Like any other trait or virtue, charity can and needs to be developed.&nbsp; As we pattern our lives after Christ, we need to seek to develop true charity.&nbsp; Having true charity is having the pure love of Christ.&nbsp; Having charity means putting others needs above our own.&nbsp; The Lord will expect charity in us.&nbsp; As we more fully develop this virtue, He will give us opportunities to more fully emulate charity in our service.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with a</em>&nbsp;<em>mantle." (D&amp;C 88:125)</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br /></strong>Brothers and sisters, now is the time to prepare to serve your Heavenly Father.&nbsp; I don't believe there is a better place or time than here and now to focus on this preparation.&nbsp; You are being blessed with opportunities to prepare, please do not procrastinate your preparation.&nbsp; You do have time to prepare, but you don't have forever to prepare. As Jacob said,&nbsp;<em>"life passes away as if in a dream."</em>&nbsp;(Jacob 7:26)&nbsp; As Alma said,&nbsp;<em>"this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors." (Alma 34:32)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the parable of the talents, the lord gave one servant five talents, one servant two talents, and one servant one talent, according to their ability, and took a long journey.&nbsp;The servant with five talents went to work and doubled his talents.&nbsp; Likewise the servant with two talents earned an additional two. The third servant thought it best to bury his one talent in a safe place.&nbsp;Upon the lord's return, the first two servants were praised for their faithfulness.&nbsp;On the other hand, the servant who had no more, or less, talents when the lord returned was harshly chastised and had his one talent taken away. (Matt 25:14-30)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Note that the lord did not compel the servants to multiply their talents.&nbsp; He simply gave them the opportunity and expected them to wisely apply their agency. Like the servants in the parable, each of us have been given "talents" and the Lord expects us to wisely apply our agency in multiplying these talents in his service.&nbsp; We will not be compelled in all things, but we will be held accountable when the Lord returns.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward."</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness" (D&amp;C 58:27-28)</em></p>
<p>Focus and effort are required to fulfill what we need to accomplish in our allotted time.&nbsp; As the "chosen generation", your potential is limitless.&nbsp; Realize, however, that reaching your potential is a duty and responsibility that will take work.&nbsp; All the potential energy in the world cannot propel a man to the moon until someone develops the process to constructively convert that potential energy to kinetic energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Start now to develop the process to unlock your full potential.&nbsp; As the "chosen generation", you actually have much to do.&nbsp; It may seem counter intuitive, but your success in completing your mission in life, even the big things you will be called upon to do, will rely upon how much focus you place on the "small and simple things" in the gospel and in your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was a student and sat where you are sitting, I do not think I realized the power in applying the basic principles I have taught today.&nbsp;I realize that what I have taught is not new to you.&nbsp;However, sometimes success in life results as much from more fully applying what we already know as it does from learning more than we already know. Sometimes we don't necessarily need to know more; sometimes we just need to more fully apply what we already know.&nbsp;There is an important difference between knowing, and acting upon what we know.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Please fully incorporate the principles we have discussed today into your life.&nbsp; Frequently and fervently approach your Father in Heaven in prayer, diligently study the scriptures, regularly and sincerely repent, even of the little sins, and do all that you can to develop and apply true charity.&nbsp; As you do these things, God will mold you into the instruments He needs you to be to fulfill his work, and in the process you will progress toward obtaining eternal life. The future is bright for those who are prepared to serve God.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are so fortunate to be members of Christ's Church.&nbsp; Christ is our Savior; He is the perfect example of charity.&nbsp; Through Him we can obtain eternal life and return to our Father in Heaven.&nbsp; May we do all that we can to serve Him now, and prepare to more fully serve Him in the future.&nbsp; This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Computer Science &amp; Electrical Engineering Department Chair</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, it is good to be with you today.&nbsp; Before I get started though, I need to confess a secret little hope that I had today.&nbsp; It probably wasn't a good hope, but in the back of my mind I was kind of hoping for it anyway.&nbsp; My hope was that when you woke up this morning, you would log onto the web site and you would have saw that I was speaking today.&nbsp; And my hope was that as you read that I currently serve as the Chairman of the Dept of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, and my hope was that you would have said to yourself, "Oh, Bro Karl must be the biggest nerd on this campus.&nbsp; I think I will skip devotional today".&nbsp; So my hope was that no one would show up today and I would be off the hook.&nbsp;<br /><br />But Brothers and Sisters, you are here.&nbsp; And actually it is really good that you are here.&nbsp; There is great strength that can come by being here.&nbsp; In the last couple of months, I have felt the promptings of the Spirit and as I have prepared this message.&nbsp; And I am sure this message is what my Heavenly Father would have me give today.&nbsp; And I hope and pray for the presence of the Holy Ghost to be with us today and I hope that we will all walk away from this today being uplifted and with a little stronger desire to become better people.&nbsp;<br /><br />To start out, I would like to relate an experience I had several years ago.&nbsp; When I first moved to Rexburg about 6 years ago, I was called to be the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;counselor to a new Bishop here in Rexburg.&nbsp; This new bishop, even though he was young, he was very wise.&nbsp; Well it just so happened that we had a member of the quorum of the seventy in our ward at the time of our call.&nbsp; And this young Bishop, he being wise, asked this member of the seventy to give some personalized training to us in the bishopric.&nbsp; So this Elder graciously agreed.&nbsp; As part of this training, the Elder talked directly to the other counselor and me for a while.&nbsp; He talked about the need of counselors to support the Bishop and how we could lighten his load.&nbsp; It was really good counsel.&nbsp; After speaking with us, he turned to the Bishop to give him his council.&nbsp; And to the best of my recollection, this is what he said.&nbsp; "Now Bishop, your job is really easy". And then he paused and then continued "Bishop, your job is to be perfect".&nbsp; And I remember sitting there thinking, oh yea, I knew I did not want to be Bishop.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course you all know where that commandment comes from.&nbsp; In a couple of places in the scriptures, our Savior said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48)&nbsp;<br /><br />Now Brothers and Sisters, I don't know about you, but every time I read this, or hear this commandment, I always cringe a little bit.&nbsp; Actually I cringe a lot of bit.&nbsp; I know I am so far from perfect, it's not even funny.&nbsp; And I will be honest with you brothers and sisters, I have struggled with this commandment a few times.&nbsp; In some parts of my life, I am a bit of a perfectionist.&nbsp; When I didn't measure up, sometimes I would get down on myself.&nbsp; Fortunately, over the years, I started to understand just what this commandment means to me.&nbsp; In the October 2007 General Conference, Elder Bednar explained it very well this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We will not attain a state of perfection in this life, but we can and should press forward with faith in Christ along the strait and narrow path and make steady progress toward our eternal destiny. The Lord's pattern for spiritual development is "line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little" (2 Nephi 28:30). Small, steady, incremental spiritual improvements are the steps the Lord would have us take. Preparing to walk guiltless before God is one of the primary purposes of mortality and the pursuit of a lifetime;" (David A Bednar "Clean Hands and a Pure Heart", Ensign, November 2007)</p>
<p>There is a great lesson in what Elder Bednar said.&nbsp; Brothers and Sisters, we do not have to be perfect.&nbsp; And we should absolutely not expect perfection in ourselves, or in anyone else.&nbsp; That includes, neighbors, friends, roommates, spouses, your children, your professors, and even your church leaders.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, we are all flawed - every last one of us.&nbsp; We all make mistakes, we all need improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now as I say this, there is a caution in this.&nbsp; Realizing that we cannot become perfected in this life is absolutely not a justification for wrong behaviors.&nbsp; The commandment is clear we are commanded to be perfect.&nbsp; When we transgress the laws and commandments of our Heavenly Father, we sin.&nbsp; And when we sin, we absolutely need to repent. Bro Peck taught that principle really well last week - if you remember, he encouraged all of us to repent regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now brothers and sisters, realizing that we all make mistakes and all need improvement, Elder Bednar outlined how we should make these improvements in our lives.&nbsp; He said, we should "press forward with faith in Christ", and make "small, steady, incremental spiritual improvements in our lives".&nbsp; Brothers and sisters that is what the Lord would have us do.&nbsp; We all need to honestly and earnestly try to become a little better each day.&nbsp;<br /><br />About 11 years ago, President Hinckley taught the same principle in a little different manner.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I speak of the need for a little more effort, a little more self-discipline, a little more consecrated effort in the direction of excellence in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is the great day of decision for each of us. For many it is the time of beginning something that will go on for as long as you live. I plead with you: don't be a scrub! Rise to the high ground of spiritual, mental, and physical excellence. You can do it. You may not be a genius. You may be lacking in some skills. But so many of us can do better than we are now doing. We are members of this great Church whose influence is now felt over the world. We are people with a present and with a future. Don't muff your opportunities. Be excellent." (Gordon B Hinckley "First Presidency Message: The Quest for Excellence", Ensign, September 1999)</p>
<p>In this quote, President Hinckley outlined three areas where we should focus on becoming more excellent.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Rise to the high ground of spiritual, mental, and physical excellence"</p>
<p>Let's look at each of these areas separately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Physical Excellence<br /></strong>First, what does it mean to be excellent physically?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think there are a couple of aspects to this.&nbsp; One aspect I think many of us can work on in our adherence to the word of wisdom.&nbsp; In Doctrine and Covenants section 89 versus 10-12, it says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man-- Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly;" (D&amp;C 89: 10-12)</p>
<p>This is something I need to work on.&nbsp; I really enjoy a good steak, and when I eat steak, I am not really a sparingly kind of guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So brothers and sisters, one way to become excellent physically is to eat good food.&nbsp; And I really encourage you, to get proper nutrition, and to take care of your bodies.&nbsp; And as you know, getting regular exercise goes hand in hand with eating well.&nbsp;<br /><br />And I know being here in a university setting, it is so easy to get caught up in the day to day assignments that you have and day to day stresses that come along with it, that it is easy to forget to eat properly and get regular exercise.&nbsp; And to make it worse, I know that many of you work either part time or even full time to support your families.&nbsp; For those who are in that boat, my heart goes out to you. &nbsp;I have been there, and I know it can be a really big struggle.&nbsp; For those just holding on, I say keep holding on.&nbsp; Don't give up.&nbsp; And in the process, try your best to eat well and get regular exercise - even if that exercise is just a short time.&nbsp; You have to make it a priority in your life.&nbsp; I really do encourage you to make it a pattern in your life now.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I also know that there are many of you who have a little more time on your hands, time that you could spend in regular exercise.&nbsp; For you, I absolutely encourage you to get involved with the activities here on campus.&nbsp; Turn off the video games.&nbsp; Turn off the computer.&nbsp; Turn off the TV.&nbsp; Go join an ultimate team, or a volleyball team, or go swimming.&nbsp; Go join one of the service activities going on. &nbsp;There are lots of way to get involved if you want to.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But whatever it is Brothers and Sisters, get out of your apartments, get your blood moving, and get involved with some of the really cool activities going on around you.&nbsp; I promise you that you will make new friends, you will develop social skills, it will help to relieve some of the day to day stress that you have.&nbsp; And you will develop talents you may not even know you had.&nbsp; In short, and this is a promise that I can make to you, it will absolutely enrich your university experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now brothers and sisters, there is a caution here also.&nbsp; It is so easy when you are having fun to spend more time doing that activity than is really wise.&nbsp; Obviously, you do have many requirements and responsibilities, and those do need to be kept also.&nbsp; But in keeping those, remember to try to be excellent physically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mental Excellence<br /></strong>Now, let's look at the second area where President Hinckley counseled us.&nbsp; He said we should be excellent mentally.&nbsp; So, what does mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I think of being mentally excellent, this concept conjures up many ideas.&nbsp; One I would like to share with you is from an experience I had while working in industry.&nbsp; Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho, I had a great career in the high technology industry.&nbsp; In the last company I worked for, as part of my responsibilities, I had the opportunity to interview and hire a number of new college graduates to work in my teams.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as part of my responsibilities, I had the great displeasure of firing just a couple of them.</p>
<p>You know brothers and sisters, it was always interesting to watch these new college graduates when they entered my organization.&nbsp; And I will tell you brothers and sisters, within the first 2 weeks, I could always tell just what kind of engineer those new graduates would be.&nbsp; It was always evident as they completed their first assignments.&nbsp; For most of the new graduates I hired, they would put their heart and soul into that first assignment and do it to the best of their abilities.&nbsp; And the output, was nearly always good.&nbsp; However for a few of my new hires, and it was definitely a minority, they just did not do a good job.&nbsp; And in each of these cases, there were always excuses.&nbsp; Some may have been valid, but definitely some weren't.&nbsp; But either way, it was apparent from that first task which of my new employees had a sense of quality and excellence.&nbsp; And who really did not care that much about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, it is so important for each of you to cultivate a personal spirit of excellence.&nbsp; And when I say this, I mean that everything you do should be high quality.&nbsp; Any task you have, any assignment you have, do it to the very best of your ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So, start now cultivating a spirit of excellence in your work.&nbsp; Don't wait till you graduate to start doing your highest quality work.&nbsp; You need to start developing the habits and the discipline now.&nbsp; When you get out in industry, it is readily apparent who has it and who doesn't. So, if you have a math assignment, double check it before you turn it in.&nbsp; Look for those blasted little minus signs that are so easy to miss.&nbsp; If you have an English paper, do several drafts and then before you turn it in, proofread it one last time.&nbsp; Absolutely don't settle for a sloppy job.&nbsp; Don't settle for a mediocre performance - strive for excellence in everything you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I will tell you.&nbsp; Quality does take effort, but if you cultivate a spirit of excellence, I promise you that it will not take that much extra effort.&nbsp; And just like everything else, the more you do it, the easier it becomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I can remember my dad trying to teach me this principle when I was a kid.&nbsp; He would say that if I was going to do a job, I should do it right, and do it right the first time.&nbsp; Growing up, one of my jobs was to mow the lawn.&nbsp; And as a kid, I always had much more important things to do than mow our lawn.&nbsp; So on several occasions, I would hurry though the task and not do a very good job.&nbsp; I would miss small sections of the grass, or I would not mow close enough to the fence, or whatever.&nbsp; I would just not do a very good job.&nbsp; When my dad got home, he would see the quality of what my work and he would always get after me.&nbsp; Now my dad was a stern taskmaster and when he had me redo the job the second time, he absolutely made sure that it was a much more unpleasant experience than it would have been if I had just done it right the first time.&nbsp; Now I'll tell you brothers and sisters, I am not an idiot, I might be a nerd, but I am not an idiot.&nbsp; And so with those very unpleasant redo's, I learned how to do a job right the first time.&nbsp; And I will tell you, I am so, so, so, so, so thankful to my dad for that.&nbsp; My dad taught me a lot of things in my life, but that one principle of doing things right the first time, has opened more doors for me and created more opportunities for me than I can count.&nbsp; It has absolutely helped me in my career and life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now students, just like my dad sometimes made life unpleasant for me, sometimes we faculty make life a little unpleasant for you.&nbsp; And the funny thing is, we do it for the same reason my dad did it to me.&nbsp; You may not believe this, but it is absolutely true, we faculty really do love you guys.&nbsp; We care how you turn out.&nbsp; We know that half-fast work does not cut it in the real world.&nbsp; When you graduate, you will be expected to a produce quality output in every single assignment.&nbsp; Your boss will have high expectations for you.&nbsp; Low quality work will not be tolerated.&nbsp; The business world is competitive, and right now, because the economy is bad, you have double whammy on you.&nbsp; If you are not up to the task, someone else will be and you and your family will suffer.&nbsp; That might sound harsh, but it is absolute reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now as I say this, I do not want to be too dark and gloomy.&nbsp; You, students, are good, and I mean that !!!&nbsp; I would have loved to have hired some of you to work in my organization back in industry.&nbsp; But I absolutely encourage you to do, is just as President Hinckley said, and I quote again:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I speak of the need for a little more effort, a little more self-discipline, a little more consecrated effort in the direction of excellence in our lives.<br />I plead with you: don't be a scrub! Don't muff your opportunities. Be excellent."</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, that spirit of excellence was the key for employees in my industry. When they came into my organization, I knew they were not perfect, they did not know everything, and as a manager, I did not expect it.&nbsp; What I did expect were employees who tried their hardest.&nbsp; I needed folks who would not surf the web for hours at a time, I needed folks who would not check their facebook page all day.&nbsp; I needed employees who had a good strong work ethic, who were not afraid to ask questions.&nbsp; I needed folks who were not arrogant.&nbsp; I needed folks who would not get offended when they did something wrong and either I or someone else had to correct them.&nbsp; In short, I needed employees who had a spirit of quality about them, a spirit of excellence.&nbsp; As a manager, I did not always find that, but when I did, they were my treasured employees.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, whatever your assignment is, do it to the very best of your ability.&nbsp; As you do so, I promise you something.&nbsp; As you really strive for quality, your self-discipline will increase - you will feel better about yourself - you will develop habits that will enrich your life and career.&nbsp; And even though it takes a little more effort to create a quality outcome, I promise you that your capacity to do that level of work will increase.&nbsp; It really does become easier over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Excellence<br /></strong>Now to the third area of excellence outlined by President Hinckley - Spiritual Excellence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, I was impressed by Bro Pecks devotional address last week.&nbsp; In that talk, he taught very plainly about the need to pray frequently and fervently, the need to place more emphasis in our scripture study, about the need to repent regularly, and the need to develop charity in our lives.&nbsp; As I think about spiritual excellence, I thought of two areas to expand on what Bro Peck talked about.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In thinking about developing charity in our lives, I want to relate an experience that I had many years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was growing up, my dad was not a member of the Church, well he was technically a member, but he really was not a member.&nbsp; My mom was very active, and she was very faithful and tried her darndest to get us kids to go to church with her each Sunday.&nbsp; And as a kid, I went most of the time with my mom.&nbsp; However as a teenager, and particularly when I was a senior in high school, I did not attend church very much. &nbsp;Consequently, when I graduated from high school, my testimony wasn't very strong.&nbsp; And in fact, I actually had a little chip on my shoulder about the Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well after graduation, I started working construction on a project in the Uinta Mountains in Utah.&nbsp; On my first day of work, I rode up to the job site with a guy named Lynn Jarrett.&nbsp; Well the job site was about an hour away, so Lynn and I had lots of time to talk in the car.&nbsp; As we were talking, I learned that Lynn had just returned from a mission.&nbsp; And I could tell, Lynn was excited about it, I could tell he loved his mission and wanted to talk about it.&nbsp; And I remember sitting there and thinking, oh no here it comes, here is this young returned missionary, full of the gospel.&nbsp; I could tell he was ready to get all fired up and start preaching the gospel and call little old Eric Karl to repentance.&nbsp; I could see it coming.&nbsp; And I thought, man, I have an hour's drive with this guy today.&nbsp;<br /><br />But an amazing thing happened.&nbsp; Lynn changed the subject of our conversation.&nbsp; He did not preach to me.&nbsp; He did not tell me what I should do or not do.&nbsp; He changed the conversation and we just had a very nice talk the rest of the ride to the job site.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Over the course of that summer, and over the course of the next summer, Lynn and I worked very closely together.&nbsp; And during that time, I started to trust Lynn.&nbsp; Lynn didn't try to preach to me, he didn't call me to repentance.&nbsp; He became my friend.&nbsp; And after he became my friend, I started asking him about the gospel.&nbsp; And when I asked, he didn't shy away, he taught me.&nbsp; He taught me by word and by example what the gospel is really about.&nbsp; And between him and two other people who came into my life around this time, and by the way, one of those two is sitting right there (she is the pretty one), I slowly started gaining a testimony.&nbsp; I started understanding why I came to this earth, and what my purpose is here.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But the funny thing brothers and sisters, and this is the point I would like to make, is that my conversion was really dependent on a friendship.&nbsp; Lynn exhibited a true spirit of charity of me.&nbsp; With the rebellious attitude I had at the time, if Lynn would have done what was in his nature, if he would have started preaching to me and thumping the bible, I would have shut him out.&nbsp; I would not have trusted him, and I am pretty darn sure I would not be standing here today.&nbsp; Lynn Jarrett befriended someone who needed a good friend.&nbsp; And for that I will be eternally grateful to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When I think of spiritual excellence, I think of our Saviors teaching to Peter.&nbsp; He said, "when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren" (Luke 22:32).&nbsp;<br /><br />And how do we strengthen our brethren? We follow President Monson's council he gave just a week ago in our stake conferences.&nbsp; If you remember, President Monson encouraged us to be true friends.&nbsp; And he said that a true friend is someone who cares, someone who loves, someone who listens, and someone who reaches out.&nbsp;<br /><br />So brothers and sisters, I absolutely encourage you to be a true friend like Lynn Jarrett.&nbsp; You may have a great group of friends and that really is awesome and a great blessing.&nbsp; But I encourage you, don't be clickish in your friendships.&nbsp; I encourage you to open up your circle of friends, get to know other people.&nbsp; Do as President Monson counseled and be true and excellent friends to everyone you can.&nbsp; Because I know firsthand the blessings of having an excellent friend.&nbsp; Lynn Jarrett did just as President Monson counseled.&nbsp; And in the process, he rescued a soul who didn't even want to be rescued at the time.&nbsp;<br /><br />And real quickly brothers and sisters, another area of spiritual excellence that all of us can become better at concerns temple attendance. &nbsp;I sincerely hope that everyone here, everyone in this room, and everyone within the sound of my voice is a current temple recommend holder. Whether you have received your endowments or not, I would hope that everyone has a current temple recommend, be it a limited use recommend or a regular one.&nbsp; It doesn't matter.&nbsp; I hope that each of us has one in our possession and each of us uses it on a very regular basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, there is tremendous power in attending the temple often.&nbsp; In the temple we learn who we really are.&nbsp; We learn why we came to this earth.&nbsp; We learn about the trials and testing we all have.&nbsp; We learn about our Savior and the work that He performed for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In short, brothers and sisters the temple is a place we absolutely need to be.&nbsp; I would hope and pray that each of us attends the temple regularly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br /></strong>Now, I started this talk with our Saviors injunction - Be ye therefore perfect.&nbsp; And as we know, every single one of us falls short of that.&nbsp; Brothers and Sisters, We are a fallen people - we have temptations, we have imperfections, we have weaknesses.&nbsp; And every one of us falls short sometimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We absolutely need to do as President Hinckley said and just try our very best.&nbsp; So, students - when working on a homework assignment, when you are writing a paper, after you finsh it, double check it.&nbsp; When doing a Math assignment, don't stop short and say, "ah that's good enough".&nbsp; That is not right, try your best, your very best in every assignment you are given.&nbsp; Take a few extra minutes, work a little harder.&nbsp; Never settle for a sloppy job.&nbsp; Never settle for mediocrity. Do it as best as you can.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To the faculty, administration, and staff, the same counsel goes for us.&nbsp; When putting a class together, don't be satisfied with just an okay class period, an okay quiz, an okay homework assignment.&nbsp; Take a few extra minutes and sincerely try to make it better.&nbsp; Spend the time necessary to strive for excellence.&nbsp; Don't be satisfied with mediocrity.&nbsp; Make the course great.&nbsp; These students and the Lord deserve our very best effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I promise you, brothers and sisters, that in those extra minutes that as you try to make it as best as you can, there is an increased blessing from the Lord.&nbsp; I have seen it and I have felt it in my classes.&nbsp; And I testify that it is true.&nbsp; It is in the extra effort where the Lord blesses us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now students, even with your best effort, you may not always get the "A" on your assignments.&nbsp; Faculty, even if you try your best, every class period will not come out like you planned.&nbsp; And all of us fall short of the commandments from time to time.&nbsp; We all sin.&nbsp;<br /><br />But brothers and sisters, we have hope in and faith in and we know about the Atonement of our Savior.&nbsp; We know the Atonement is the central part of our Heavenly Fathers plan for us.&nbsp; Our Heavenly Father knew we would not be perfect in this life.&nbsp; He knew we would stumble and make mistakes.&nbsp; He planned just for those occurrences.&nbsp; And our Savior, as the central figure in that plan, He willingly fulfilled his part of that plan for us and for our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; Our eldest brother, our Savior, he willingly knelt in the Garden of Gethsemane, where in agony, he said, "Father if thou be willing, remove this cup from me, nevertheless not my will but thine be done" (Luke 22:42).&nbsp; And our Savior willingly allowed those soldiers to drive nails into his hands and feet.&nbsp; And finally, after pain and agony such that our mortal minds really cannot comprehend, he stated those final words that we cherish so much.&nbsp; He said, "It is finished" (John 19:30).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, our Savior did live a perfect life, he completed his work perfectly, because He knew we couldn't do it.&nbsp; What he asks in return is that we live excellent lives.&nbsp; What he asks of us is "our hearts and our willing minds" (D&amp;C 64:34).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My hope brothers and sisters, is that when we walk out of this room today, we will choose to become a little more excellent.&nbsp; And this hope is for all of us, students, faculty, and staff.&nbsp; I hope that everyone of us earnestly seeks to cultivate a spirit of excellence in all that we do.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, it does take effort to do that, however, as President Hinckley said, "The distance between mediocrity and excellence can be ever so small."&nbsp;<br /><br />And as you try to do just a little bit more, to be a little bit better, I testify that your life will be enriched.&nbsp; You will stand taller.&nbsp; As you work hard to try to accomplish your goals, you will not be perfect, you still may not get a "A", however, you absolutely will feel better about yourself.&nbsp; I promise you that this is the case.&nbsp; It will happen.&nbsp; As President Hinckley also said,&nbsp;"The little extra effort we make becomes such a tremendous difference."&nbsp;<br /><br />I know this to be true, and I testify of it, in the sacred name of our Savior, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I am humbled and honored, and rather overwhelmed, by the opportunity I have been given to speak to you today.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trailer Story<br /></strong>I would like to begin by telling you a story. &nbsp;This past Christmas, my wife and I decided that we would purchase an old, used snowmobile as a large family gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;My challenge was to figure out how I would get the snowmobile to the family cabin we would be staying at and have it waiting outside on Christmas morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;The main obstacle was the fact that the old trailer I was planning on transporting it with had a problem.&nbsp; The lights didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years we have used that trailer for all kinds of things, but its main purpose was to haul goats.&nbsp; We had a number of large goats that we used as pack animals. We loved to go backpacking but because our children were so young, we needed help carrying everything, so these large goats, which can each carry 40-50 lbs, were a big help. This old trailer had served us well in this capacity, but recently the lights had been giving us problems and had finally stopped working a couple of years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Though it was always at the back of my mind, at least on Saturday's, I procrastinated fixing it because I just knew it would mean redoing all the wiring.&nbsp; This was despite the fact that it meant I didn't use the trailer much anymore, and when I did, I would feel guilty as I would occasionally sneak out to the dump with loads of garbage early on Saturday mornings, trying to use the old hand signals you learn in elementary school bicycle safety classes.&nbsp;<br /><br />So now it is December 24.&nbsp; Our family's Christmas depended on my getting the trailer fixed so that I can sneak back home from the cabin during the night and get the snowmobile there for Christmas morning.&nbsp; I can't let anyone know I am fixing it because that would give it away.&nbsp; So after two years of procrastination, I snuck out early in the morning to rewire the trailer.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was 8 degrees out and the wind was blowing so I bundled up and put on my old one-piece purple ski suit from DI.&nbsp;&nbsp; My first task was to replace the plug that goes into the back of the vehicle since we have a different vehicle than we did when the lights last worked.&nbsp; This went pretty smoothly and I started hoping that the old plug may have been the problem in the first place.&nbsp; So after replacing it, I pulled around our Suburban and plugged it in.&nbsp; I then went around to the back of the trailer and got real excited when I saw that the trailer lights were on.&nbsp; I knew I was being blessed.&nbsp;<br /><br />I quietly drug my wife out of the warm house and had her sit in the driver's seat while I went around to the back of the trailer again.&nbsp; Crossing my fingers, I asked her to turn on the left signal.&nbsp; But both the left and right lights started blinking.&nbsp; I then had her turn on the right signal and the same thing happened.&nbsp; She then pushed the brake and instead of both lights getting brighter, all the lights went out completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew I was sunk, that I was going to spend the rest of the day crawling under the trailer, in the snow, replacing all the wiring.&nbsp;<br /><br />In my desperation, and in order to give myself a few minutes to warm up inside, I decided to turn to the true source of all secular knowledge - the internet and Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;After typing some keywords describing my trailer's symptoms, I was amazed that one of the first links addressed my exact symptoms of both lights blinking instead of one and the lights going out when the brake is applied.&nbsp; I couldn't believe it.&nbsp; I wanted to kiss the screen, particularly when I read that the solution was something very simple and easy to fix.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />According to the website, the problem was that the trailer's electrical system was not properly grounded.&nbsp; There was likely a wire that was poorly connected to the frame of the trailer - a wire that should normally complete the electrical circuit and allow electricity to flow freely from my vehicle, to trailer lights, and back again.&nbsp;<br /><br />Energized, I snuck back outside, crawled under the trailer, and sure enough discovered that the ground wire was almost broken off.&nbsp; So I cut off the bad end of the wire and stripped some of the white insulation exposing clean good wire and reattached it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I grabbed my wife again and got behind the trailer and excitedly asked her to push the brake.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights went out just like before.&nbsp; The turn signal didn't work either.&nbsp; However, I could tell that there was some improvement because the lights, when they were on, were brighter than they had been, which gave me some hope that I was on the right track.&nbsp;<br /><br />I quickly remembered that as I was fixing the ground wire, the thought had come to me that I should probably clean up the metal of the frame and the screw, but because my hands were numb, and I was in a hurry, I ignored that thought. &nbsp;I went back, undid the screw, used a wire brush to clean off the rust and clean up the screw, and got it back together.&nbsp;<br /><br />I got my wife back out a third time - she pushed the break pedal - and hallelujah, the brake lights came on as bright as can be.&nbsp; And sure enough only the right light blinked when it was supposed to and so did the left.&nbsp; After two years of worrying about it, and the pressure of getting it fixed that day in the cold, I literally jumped up and down and hugged my wife I was so happy.&nbsp;<br /><br />A few minutes later, as I was gathering up my tools and thinking about what had happened, the Spirit quietly spoke to me and said in essence,&nbsp;<em>"there are some important lessons that can be learned from this experience, use them well."</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Being Spiritually Grounded<br /></strong>I would like to try and do that today by speaking to you about the importance of being spiritually grounded. &nbsp;Just as the properly grounded wire allowed power to flow through the trailer, illumining the lights and allowing directions and warnings to be conveyed, being spiritually grounded allows the Spirit to flow through us and provide the power and the direction that we need in our lives.&nbsp; Because of this, it is vital for each of us to be spiritually grounded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many of us, at times, ever feel like that old trailer? &nbsp;When we should get lights that say stop, do the lights go out instead?&nbsp; When we need to know whether we should turn to the left or to the right, do both lights blink?&nbsp;<br /><br />Being grounded is a way of describing the spiritual connection that should exist between us and the Godhead. &nbsp;When we are spiritually grounded, all of the benefits of the Holy Spirit are available to us.&nbsp;<br /><br />I propose that the quality of the connection between us and the Lord, or how well we are grounded, is largely dependant on the condition of our hearts.&nbsp; If our hearts are right, and the connection is good, the power of God is able to flow through us, and direct our choices and actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Broken Heart<br /></strong>To better understand what our hearts should be like, let's look at the scriptures for some answers - the true source of the most important information. &nbsp;In 3 Nephi 9: 20 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart ... , him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost."</em></p>
<p>Elder Bruce Porter, in the October 2007 general conference, taught the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"What are a broken heart and a contrite spirit? And why are they considered a sacrifice?"</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"As in all things, the Savior's life offers us the perfect example: though Jesus of Nazareth was utterly without sin, He walked through life with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, as manifested by His submission to the will of the Father. "For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me" (John 6:38). To His disciples He said, "Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart" (Matthew 11:29). And when the time came to pay the ultimate sacrifice entailed in the Atonement, Christ shrank not to partake of the bitter cup but submitted completely to His Father's will."</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"The Savior's perfect submission to the Eternal Father is the very essence of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Christ's example teaches us that a broken heart is an eternal attribute of godliness. When our hearts are broken, we are completely open to the Spirit of God and recognize our dependence on Him for all that we have and all that we are. The sacrifice so entailed is a sacrifice of pride in all its forms. Like malleable clay in the hands of a skilled potter, the brokenhearted can be molded and shaped in the hands of the Master."<sup>1</sup></em></p>
<p>A broken heart is not necessarily a broken down heart, or a withered or flattened heart.&nbsp; It is a heart that is open and submissive to the Lord, a heart that is ready to be molded and shaped by him.&nbsp; The opposite of a broken heart is a stony, or hard heart that is closed to the workings of the Spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In Mosiah chapter 5 verse 2 we find another helpful description of what our hearts should be.&nbsp; Following King Benjamin's powerful sermon, the people cried with one voice saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"...Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have<strong>&nbsp;</strong>no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually."</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From these two scriptures, we have learned that our hearts should be broken and open to the Savior, and that they should desire that which is good and no longer desire to do evil.&nbsp;&nbsp; These desired attributes of the heart are sometimes referred to together as a "change of heart" or a "new heart."&nbsp;<br /><br />Are there some ways that we can test the condition of our hearts and whether we are receiving the power and direction of the Spirit that we need?&nbsp; When working with wires and electricity, we can use a multi-tester like the one I have in my hand.&nbsp; By hooking it to a wire, or to a fuse or switch, and by turning the knob to specify the information wanted, we can tell if there is a good connection or circuit and also how much power or electricity is flowing through it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Imagine that I was able to attach these wires to myself, like this, kind of like an EKG machine, and then turn the dial to the heart setting to see what it says.&nbsp; Hopefully, if I did so the machine would say "broken heart" and wouldn't say "hard or stony heart."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Since we don't have such a machine, are there some other ways that we can test the status of our hearts?&nbsp; The scriptures provide us with one such tool.&nbsp; We have been given a series of questions regarding a "change of heart" that can be very valuable and important. In fact, the new Young Women's personal progress value of virtue includes a required value experience for which young women read Alma 5 and examine the series of questions it contains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In verse 14 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?" (Alma 5:14)</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it interesting that Alma recognizes that there are members of the church who have been baptized and who are probably attending church, but have not had the change of heart that we have been speaking of.&nbsp; Some of you may feel that this is the situation that you are currently in.&nbsp; However, I would guess that most of you that feel this way have simply not recognized the change because it has been a gradual and constant part of your life.&nbsp;<br /><br />In verse 26, Alma goes on to address the rest of us who have experience this change of heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?" (Alma 5:26)</em></p>
<p>He then proceeds to ask us some very tough questions regarding things that can cause our hearts to become closed and hard.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? That your garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?" (Alma 5: 27)</em></p>
<p>He then asks if we are stripped of pride and of envy and says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"...if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life." (Alma 5:28)</em></p>
<p>In other words, though we may have had a broken, changed heart at one time, and were grounded and guided by the Spirit, if we are not careful, a lack of humility, pride and envy, can cause our hearts to harden - something that each one of us must diligently guard against.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Having a change of heart doesn't mean that we don't have moments of weakness or don't make mistakes, but it is does indicate what the basic desire and state of our hearts should be, and serves a warning if it is not.&nbsp; It doesn't mean that we aren't enticed by an exciting action movie or video game, or the latest wonderfully romantic love story.&nbsp; But it should mean that we lose that desire to view or participate if we discover that what is being portrayed is offensive to the Spirit, such as when good is being portrayed as being evil, or evil things are being portrayed as being good.&nbsp; It means that we seek for and desire&nbsp;<em>"that which is virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy,"<sup>2</sup></em>&nbsp;and that we avoid to the very best of our ability, and are saddened and offended by, that which is dark and evil, or that arouses inappropriate sexual thoughts or feelings, or that is crude and vulgar, even if it is a supposed to be a comedy.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is a test that we may need to administer to ourselves every day.&nbsp; The next time you are in the video store, or flipping through the cable stations, put on your imaginary heart monitor and see if it doesn't change your perception of the videos, the shows, or the video games you are considering.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now that we have examined what our hearts need to be like in order to be grounded and have the Spirit flowing through us, let's now look more closely at the power and help that we can receive.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Power and Decisions<br /></strong>At your Stake Conference, just over two weeks ago, you may recall Elder Hales describing the years that you are in now as the Decade of Decision.&nbsp; He, of course, was referring to the big decisions about whether and when you will serve a mission, what you will major in or do for a career, and whom you will marry.&nbsp;Each of these decisions are heavily influenced by numerous smaller decisions that are made every day and yet may have far reaching consequences.&nbsp; Decisions such as "should I go to that ward activity tonight or should I just stay in my room with Facebook?"&nbsp; Should I go talk to my professor for help or advice?" Or, while looking in the mirror, "should I be wearing this?"&nbsp;&nbsp;For each of these questions, what are the possible outcomes and implications?&nbsp; Who knows? Actually there is someone who does know.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These decisions, both big and small, will be made one way or the other. &nbsp;You can make them based on your own best judgment, and the wise counsel of TV personalities. &nbsp;Or, because you are grounded, and your heart is right, you can make them with the help of the Spirit and receive counsel and guidance from your loving Father in Heaven, who knows what the outcome of those daily small choices will be, who knows the heart and the potential of that young man or young woman you are dating, who knows what occupation you will be the most happy and successful in, and who knows what future work you have been foreordained to perform in his kingdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />What would have happened if I had driven with that old trailer at night when the wiring wasn't grounded and the lights didn't work? At best I could have received a citation.&nbsp; At worst a terrible accident could have happened that might have impacted me for the rest of my life as well as many others.&nbsp; We run a similar risk when we live our lives without the Spirit's guidance and protection.&nbsp;<br /><br />Looking back, again, at the time when my trailer's lights weren't working, you might remember that I only dared to use the trailer for occasional trips to the dump on Saturday mornings.&nbsp; It was no longer as useful for important events for my family.&nbsp;<br /><br />Almost all us have the opportunity and the responsibility to serve and to bless the lives of one another, through our callings as visiting or home teachers, Sunday School teachers, or as members of an Elder's Quorum or Relief Society presidency.&nbsp; In each of these capacities we have the responsibility to represent the Savior, to be his hands, his feet, and to speak his words.&nbsp; Can we do this without the power and inspiration that comes from being spiritually grounded?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When I did use the trailer, even just running out to the dump, I felt nervous and vulnerable as I used my hand signals out the window.&nbsp; When we are NOT grounded and the Spirit is not with us, we make ourselves unavailable for the Lord to use.&nbsp; He must choose someone else to teach that important lesson, to fulfill that important calling or to touch the life of that individual in need.&nbsp; And if we are called upon to do these things, we feel vulnerable and nervous because we cannot effectively perform the Savior's work without the guidance and power of His Spirit.&nbsp; Some are able to make due with their own talents and strengths for a time, but the work that is accomplished is generally only superficial.&nbsp;<br /><br />We may be given authority through the priesthood we hold or the calling we have received, but without the Spirit, we don't have the power or the necessary inspiration to really make a difference in peoples' lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to Become Grounded<br /></strong>So how do we become grounded if we are not? &nbsp;First we can look at the examples of those in the scriptures who came to recognize their separation from God and his power.&nbsp; One such example is found in Alma 22 where read about Lamoni's Father, the King of all the Lamanites, and his response after being taught by Aaron.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"...What shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I do that I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day? Behold, said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy."</em>&nbsp;<br /><em>"But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this thing,&nbsp;...if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then thou shalt receive the hope which thou desirest."</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"And it came to pass that when Aaron had said these words, the king did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he did prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day." (Alma 22:15-18)</em></p>
<p>What can we learn from this beautiful example?&nbsp; What did the King do to bring about this mighty change in his heart?&nbsp; First, he had great desire.&nbsp; He then had faith to act upon the words of Aaron, he humbled himself before the Lord, he prayed with a sincere and open heart, and he completely repented of all his sins.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />These are all small and simple, yet profound things that we are taught and reminded about regularly so we won't take time to discuss them now, except for one point that I would like to make regarding repentance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For over two years, I procrastinated fixing my old trailer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I procrastinated was that I was fearful of the time, effort and pain it would take to crawl around under that trailer and get it fixed, and I really wasn't sure how to go about doing it.&nbsp; As a result I largely lost the use of the trailer for those years and, as I said before, when I did use it I felt nervous and very vulnerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;When I did learn what needed to be done, my first attempt failed because I tried to take a shortcut.&nbsp; To finally fix it, I had to go back and REALLY clean up the connection and get it securely grounded.&nbsp; A rusty corroded connection was not good enough.&nbsp; In the end, fixing the real problem took only a few minutes of actual labor.&nbsp; If I had only known, I wouldn't have wasted all that time worrying about it and wouldn't have lost those two years of usefulness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If any of you are feeling unworthy and estranged from the Spirit of the Lord due to serious sin, I encourage you to repent.&nbsp; Do not procrastinate.&nbsp; I promise you that the time, effort and pain that true repentance may require, while real, is insignificant to the price you will pay if you continue to procrastinate.&nbsp; Follow the example of Lamoni's Father, the King, who as soon as he knew what needed to be done immediately humbled himself before the Lord and begged for forgiveness. The sooner you start the healing process by visiting with your Bishop, the sooner you will feel the loving embrace of your Savior, the peace and confidence that comes from a clear conscience and the power and the direction of his Spirit flowing through your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't let another day pass.&nbsp; Your bishop will be doing interviews tonight.&nbsp; Just go.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When our hearts are changed and the power and direction of Spirit is flowing through us, the Lord in his wisdom has given us a weekly opportunity to test and strengthen our connection to Him as we prepare for and partake of the sacrament.&nbsp; He knows that we need this regular and consistent opportunity to examine our lives for things we need to repent of, and to receive strength and direction as we remember Him, His teachings, and most importantly, His love for us.&nbsp;<br /><br />His love is what gives us hope. &nbsp;Hope that we can make it through another day. Hope that we can be truly happy.&nbsp; Hope that we can return to Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Too Hard<br /></strong>As you have been listening to this talk, some of you may have begun to feel discouraged thinking that it is just to hard to do or that in order to be grounded, to have broken heart, that you need to be perfect. &nbsp;As Brother Carl taught us so well last week, none of us will earn or attain perfection in this life, at least not on our own.</p>
<p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie, a former member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"We don't need to get a complex or get a feeling that you have to be perfect to be saved. You don't. There's only been one perfect person, and that's the Lord Jesus, but in order to be saved in the Kingdom of God and in order to pass the test of mortality, what you have to do is get on the straight and narrow path--thus charting a course leading to eternal life--and then, being on that path, pass out of this life in full fellowship. I'm not saying that you don't have to keep the commandments. I'm saying you don't have to be perfect to be saved. If you did, no one would be saved."</em><sup>3</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>So if we have repented and are on the path doing our best, we are in a saved condition.&nbsp; We are grounded and have the right to the power and the direction of the Spirit in our lives. The difference between our best efforts and the perfection and purity that is required for us to be saved and return to our Heavenly Father is made up through Christ's Atonement.&nbsp; In fact, all that we have talked about this afternoon is made possible through His Atonement, His grace, and His overwhelming love for us.&nbsp;This is the path to true happiness in this life.&nbsp; This is the path to eternal life and exaltation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Of this I humbly testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a wonderful blessing for my wife and me to be with you today. I will never forget coming here 34 years ago.&nbsp; It was a few weeks after a devastating flood had surged through this area as a result of the Teton Dam failure.&nbsp; A large group of us from the Salt Lake area came to Rexburg to help. &nbsp;When we arrived we were assigned to help clean up houses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we traveled to Sugar City, I saw mud caked on buildings. Topsoil had been stripped from farmland. Large power poles had been swept away from a pole yard by the raging flood and were laying around everywhere.&nbsp; They had become like torpedoes and damaged buildings in their path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We spent the day cleaning up the basement of a home. As we pulled paneling off of the walls, water and mud trapped behind the paneling gushed out. It was an unbelievable and unforgettable mess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time, I wondered if this region would ever be restored to what it was before the flood, and even if it could, be how long it would take.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, it is so impressive to me to see how this community and the surrounding area have flourished. &nbsp;Ricks College has been transformed into a vibrant university.&nbsp; This campus is beautiful. You have a magnificent temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are so blessed to be students at BYU Idaho.&nbsp; You are blessed to have someone with the wisdom and vision of President Clark guiding this university. We see great things happening here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been impressed with your learning model. Your learning is truly deepened as you follow the model.&nbsp; I wish that it had been part of my college experience. You are developing valuable skills that will benefit you for the remainder of your life. Learners do much better when they are actively engaged in the learning process and the BYU Idaho Learning Model is all about engaging learners.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I would like to share some thoughts with you today about becoming engaged - why it is important to be engaged and how to become engaged.&nbsp; This is not a talk for you returned missionaries about your responsibility to get married. &nbsp;That is a great idea and a high priority but when that happens and who it will be with is obviously not completely within your control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you have heard about the young man who was immediately smitten when he met an attractive young woman.&nbsp; After a couple of dates, he was certain that he had met his true love. Even though they hardly knew each other, he decided to buy an engagement ring. &nbsp;At the end of their next date, he excitedly pulled out a little box with the ring inside and said, &ldquo;If you can guess what&rsquo;s inside this box, you can have it along with an unforgettable kiss.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;Ok, let&rsquo;s see&hellip; how about an elephant?&rdquo;&nbsp; Obviously, this couple was not on the same page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when you are on the same page, there can be surprises<strong>.&nbsp; </strong>The story is told of a London floor installer named Lefkos.&nbsp; The unlucky man&rsquo;s dream of giving his chosen one, Leanne, the perfect engagement proposal literally vanished into thin air.&nbsp; Lefkos, had concealed a $10,000 engagement ring inside a helium balloon.&nbsp; The idea was that she would pop the balloon as he popped the question.&nbsp; (very creative right?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as he left the shop, a gust of wind pulled the balloon from his hand and he watched the engagement ring begin to sail away over the rooftops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just watched as it went further and further into the air.&nbsp; &ldquo;I felt like such a fool.&nbsp; It cost a fortune and I knew my girlfriend would kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lefkos spent two hours in his vehicle trying to chase and find the balloon, without success.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought I would give Leanne a pin so I could literally pop the question,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I had to tell her the story &ndash; she went absolutely mad.&nbsp; Now she is refusing to speak to me until I get her a new ring.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is hoping the ring will still turn up.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be amazing if someone found it,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously, finding the right one and making the decision to get engaged to be married will be a great time in your life.&nbsp; Today, however, I want to focus on your personal engagement in doing meaningful things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does it mean to be engaged?&nbsp; To be engaged is to be interested, involved and committed to something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The list of activities and interests that people engage in is endless. &nbsp;They range from consuming work to pure recreation and everything in between.&nbsp; Some of them can be very exciting yet less significant than others.&nbsp; For example, the Sports Entertainment and Merchandise industry alone generates over $110 Billion annually from sports fans.&nbsp; That amount does not include the value of spectators&rsquo; time spent sitting in stands or in front of a TV watching sports.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Nothing in sports engages more people than the World Cup.&nbsp; This Friday, the 2010 World Cup begins in Johannesburg South Africa. This is the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic games. 32 soccer teams representing their countries will participate in the competition. Cumulative TV viewership will approach 30 billion during the month long tournament. In the past, the final match alone has had a TV viewership in excess of 1 billion people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been in Brazil during four world cups. Soccer in Brazil is the national past time and passion. Only if you have been there can you fully appreciate the level of interest and enthusiasm. During the World Cup, banners are strung across the streets and even the pavement is painted.&nbsp; People wear clothing with the green and yellow colors of the country. Festivities are everywhere. When Brazil plays, the country of 190 Million people virtually stops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a goal is scored, there is an eruption of fire crackers, horns and noise makers. You would think World War III had begun. If the national team wins the match, the celebrations go on throughout the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoy watching world cup matches just like billions of other people do.&nbsp; However, I have dreamed about what would happen if all of this interest and excitement, all of this energy and collective engagement were directed toward some effort that was really meaningful.&nbsp; Doing so would certainly change the world.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Lord knows that and He shared His expectation that we be meaningfully engaged in a revelation given to Joseph Smith found in Doctrine and Covenants section 58.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;&rdquo; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.&rdquo; (D&amp;C 58: 26-28)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph Smith is an excellent example to the world and especially to busy young adults like you that no matter that you are young and busy, you can be anxiously engaged in a good cause and bring about much righteousness.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s review some of the things Joseph Smith did as a young adult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Age 21</p>
<p>* he married Emma Hales</p>
<p>* he received the golden plates</p>
<p>*&nbsp;he and Emma moved from Manchester, NY to Harmony, PA to escape the persecution they were</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; experiencing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Age&nbsp;22</p>
<p>* he began translating the Book of Mormon</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Martin Harris lost the 116 pages of the translated manuscript and in that same month</p>
<p>* Joseph and Emma had their first child &ndash; a boy but they were devastated when he died within a few hours of birth</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Age&nbsp;23</p>
<p>* he completed the translation of the Book of Mormon with the help of Oliver Cowdery</p>
<p>* He and Oliver received the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood that year</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Age&nbsp;24</p>
<p>* he oversaw the printing of the first copies of the Book of Mormon</p>
<p>* he organized the church and he began translating the Bible</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Age&nbsp;25</p>
<p>* Joseph and Emma moved to Kirtland, Ohio.<br />* they had twins that year and suffered great heartache again when both their babies died the same day that they were</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; born</p>
<p>* Joseph traveled to Missouri and dedicated a site for a temple in Missouri</p>
<p>* he printed the Book of Commandments</p>
<p>* he and Sydney Rigdon went on a mission</p>
<p>He did all of this and many more things by age 25</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the time he turned 30</p>
<p>* he had received 107 sections of the Doctrine and Covenants</p>
<p>* established the church in Kirtland and Missouri</p>
<p>* a temple was near completion in Kirtland&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Quorums of the 12 and 70 had been organized</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Joseph Smith accomplished during his young adult years is unmatched in the history of the world.&nbsp; The great things he did could not have happened without being anxiously engaged.&nbsp; All of us will be forever indebted to him. We can be blessed in our life&rsquo;s mission as we reflect upon and strive to emulate his example of engagement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the great blessings of attending BYU Idaho is that you not only get a first class education but you get it in a first class environment.&nbsp; You are surrounded by so many great examples of people who are anxiously engaged in a good cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week, several extraordinary BYU-Idaho students were interviewed to see what could be learned from them about being anxiously engaged. It was no surprise to&nbsp; learn from these interviews that these &nbsp;students don&rsquo;t do things half-baked. &nbsp;When they do something it will be their best effort. &nbsp;Mediocrity is foreign to them.</p>
<p><br />They recognize the many blessings and opportunities that they have been given and they want to make the most of them. &nbsp;They know that pursuing a good education and doing well in school is an important way to be anxiously engaged in a good cause.</p>
<p>They also recognize that during your college years there is a real risk in becoming immersed in your own interests, your studies and other personal activities. &nbsp;You can begin to turn inward and become selfish. &nbsp;This inward focus, can lead you to neglect doing things that will bless others and spiritually strengthen yourself.<br /><br /></p>
<p>To counter that in their lives, they strive to be anxiously engaged in a good cause and help others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p>They suggested doing some of things that they do:</p>
<p>* Get involved in ward and extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>* Go to the temple once a week.</p>
<p>* Be friendly and go out of your way to meet people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Smile.&nbsp; Pull the earbuds out and say hi when you pass someone.</p>
<p>* Be proactive in your learning because that is what the learning model is about.</p>
<p>* Appreciate the sacred funds that subsidize your tuition and seek to give back to the university through service in school</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; organizations.</p>
<p>* Start each day with a positive and anxiously engaged attitude.</p>
<p>* Strive to be prepared and engaged in everything you do.&nbsp; Your effort will influence roommates and classmates to do the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; same.</p>
<p>These are some great ideas.&nbsp; I was also impressed how they repeatedly mentioned how important it is to do &ldquo;small things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great&rdquo;. (D&amp;C 64:33)</em></p>
<p>Elder Koichi Aoyagi of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Quorum of the 70 spoke in April General Conference about his life changing as a result of a seemingly &ldquo;small thing&rdquo; that someone did for him. In his talk, he told of his conversion at age 17 in Matsumoto Japan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The next year I entered the university in Yokohama. Living alone, far from my hometown and the people I knew, I became lonely and strayed from the Church. One day I received a postcard from a Church member back home. She wrote that she had heard I was not attending Church meetings. She quoted a scripture and invited me to return to church. I was overwhelmed by the words of the scripture. This helped me realize that maybe I had lost something important, and I pondered and struggled for many days&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I realized that I was not praying with all of my heart and decided to do so. &hellip;Through the power of the Holy Ghost, I learned that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, live and that They truly appeared to Joseph Smith. I made a commitment in my heart to repent and faithfully follow Jesus Christ for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;This spiritual experience changed my life completely! I decided to serve a mission out of gratitude to the Lord and to the Church member who rescued me. Following my mission, I was sealed in the temple to a wonderful girl, and we have been blessed with four children. Not coincidentally, this is the same girl who saved me by sending a postcard to that lonely apartment in Yokohama many years ago. I remain ever grateful for the mercy of the Lord and the help of this Church member, who invited me to once again come unto Christ.&rdquo;</em><strong> </strong><sup>1</sup></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>What a powerful example of out of small things proceedeth that which is great. Can you think of someone who could use some encouragement? &nbsp;All it might take is a postcard, text message or email to rescue them.&nbsp; Could you give a few minutes out of your busy day to lend a listening ear to someone who needs to share a burden? These may seem to be small and inconsequential things, but always remember that great results can come from small acts.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We have been given gifts that can help us to be anxiously engaged and to bring about much righteousness.&nbsp; This is an ideal time in your life to recognize how precious these gifts are and to embrace them.&nbsp; I would like to emphasize three of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the gift of a Church Calling.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A calling in the church is a wonderful gift from the Lord to be anxiously engaged in a good cause.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In D&amp;C 107:99-100 the Lord said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo; Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo; He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand.&nbsp; Even so.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The duties of our callings are not all spelled out.&nbsp; Remember, that God does not command in all things.&nbsp; He leaves for you to find the ways to learn your duties and to fulfill your callings. &nbsp;This encourages initiative and personal growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we are anxiously engaged, we will be diligent and seek to do our best and magnify our callings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I came home from my mission, my bishop called me to be the priests quorum adviser.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I want you to teach on Sunday and attend mutual every week.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought at the time that he was asking a lot of a young returned missionary who &nbsp;was working a lot of hours, carrying a heavy load in school and running hard to catch up to his future wife.&nbsp; I soon realized, that my bishop was inspired.&nbsp; The Lord knew that I needed the spiritual balance of a significant calling during those years.&nbsp; I am so grateful today for the gift of that calling.&nbsp; I was engaged and I received so many blessings because of it. &nbsp;Subsequent callings have also been a source of great blessings for me. &nbsp;Church service is a gift given by a loving Heavenly Father who knows where true happiness is found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have a calling in the church, talk to your bishop about your hope and desire to have one.&nbsp; If you already have a calling, seek to be anxiously engaged and do your best to magnify it.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Sabbath Day is a wonderful gift for spiritual, mental, emotional and physical renewal. &nbsp;It is a day to balance our lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;We can dedicate ourselves to our church callings. &nbsp;We can take time to seek opportunities to help and edify others.<br />When I was in college, I realized what a gift the Sabbath Day was in accomplishing that. &nbsp;I committed that I wouldn't do any homework &nbsp;on Sunday. &nbsp;There were more than a few Monday mornings when I got up very early to prepare for the coming week. &nbsp;I can tell you that I looked forward to Sunday. &nbsp;It became the highlight of my week. &nbsp;I was blessed in my schoolwork by striving to keep the Sabbath day holy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a personal testimony of the many blessings that come as we honor the Lord's day.</p>
<p><br />As members of the church, we have received the precious gift of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp; God has given us this companion to be with us at all times, as we are worthy. &nbsp;The Holy Ghost connects us to the powers of heaven. &nbsp;It inspires us and prompts us to become engaged and to be an instrument in God's hands to bring about much righteousness. &nbsp;As we learn to act on promptings we receive, our lives will be richer and it will be easier for us to be more engaged with things that God wants us to do.</p>
<p><br />In Section 11 the Lord said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good&mdash;yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Verily, verily, I say u<a target="_self"></a>nto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy;&rdquo; (D&amp;C 11: 12-13)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are blessed with the companionship of the Spirit, divine enlightenment blesses your studies and your personal decisions.&nbsp; Think of the life defining decisions that you will make in the next few years, such as: Who to marry, what to study, your choice for a career and where you will work and live.&nbsp; If there was ever a time in your life when you need the revelatory influence of the Holy Ghost, it is when you make these critical decisions. I would counsel you to pray each day for the guidance of the Holy Ghost to help you know what God would have you do. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The students that were interviewed last week were asked to share some of the blessings that they have received as they anxiously engaged.&nbsp; Here are some of their answers:</p>
<p>* Having the satisfaction of knowing that you helped someone.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;I increased my testimony and gained a greater love for my fellow man.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;When I am feeling down and not having the best day, service is that best way to feel better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp;I am a better disciple of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Because you sacrifice, you have more time.&nbsp; You become more focused with the time that you have.&nbsp; When you have&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; deadlines you are focused to get things done.</p>
<p>* I have been blessed and have done well in all of my classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* My mind is clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I am having fun.</p>
<p>Blessings abound when you are anxiously engaged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to mention one other important blessing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That blessing is protection against the adversary.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 Nephi chapter 15 tells about Laman and Lemuel asking Nephi to interpret their father&rsquo;s dream.&nbsp; In verses 26 and 27 we read:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And they said unto me: What meaneth the river of water which our father saw?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And I said unto them that the water which my father saw was filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things that he beheld not the filthiness of the water.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The river was right next to the path that Lehi was standing on but he didn&rsquo;t see the filthiness of the water. He didn&rsquo;t stare at it. He did not think about it. He really wasn&rsquo;t interested in it. His mind was elsewhere. What were those other things that his mind was swallowed up in?&nbsp; They were undoubtedly good and righteous things including the concern that he had for his family and their spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we are surrounded by rivers of filthiness such as pornography.&nbsp; An idle mind is the devil&rsquo;s workshop.&nbsp; We strengthen ourselves from seeking or seeing that filthiness when our minds are swallowed up in good things.&nbsp; To be anxiously engaged in bringing to pass much righteousness will help us to swallow up our minds in righteousness and protect us from the adversary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that those who feel overwhelmed will pay close attention to what I am going to say now.&nbsp; As a busy college student, you may look longingly for the day when you will be done with college and can then have enough time to really be engaged in a good cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember well getting back into school following my mission. I was rusty in math and other subjects after having been away from school for 2 years. I felt over my head. I found myself looking forward to my college days being over so I wouldn&rsquo;t feel so much pressure. I also longed for my days in the mission field where I was anxiously engaged in serving and helping people change their lives. Life seemed more fulfilling and enjoyable during my mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day during this time, I came across a poem that hit me like a lightning bolt. It says:</p>
<p><em>Yesterday is but a dream</em></p>
<p><em>Tomorrow is only a vision</em></p>
<p><em>But today - well lived</em></p>
<p><em>Makes every yesterday a dream of happiness</em></p>
<p><em>And every tomorrow a vision of hope.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I knew then that I couldn&rsquo;t return to my mission and I knew I couldn&rsquo;t fast-forward through my college years. I knew that I needed to focus on today and make it a day well-lived.&nbsp; That required an attitude adjustment.&nbsp; I made that adjustment and I have been blessed.&nbsp; You can make that adjustment if needed and be blessed.</p>
<p>Being anxiously engaged does not need to nor should it wait until tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Monson has said, <em>&ldquo;If we live only for tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll have a lot of empty yesterdays today.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;I bear witness that Thomas S. Monson is a prophet of God.&nbsp; I have had the privilege to get a closer glimpse into his life this past year.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe any of us can fully comprehend the weight of the burden that he carries as President of the church and as God&rsquo;s prophet to the entire world.&nbsp; His responsibilities are immense.&nbsp; His schedule is packed with meetings and other appointments.&nbsp; Yet, we hear over and over from others about President Monson visiting rest homes, hospitals, viewings and funerals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We read in the New Testament that &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth &hellip;went about doing good.&rdquo;&nbsp; President Monson follows the Savior&rsquo;s example in doing good.&nbsp; His life and ministry is a shining example of one who is anxiously engaged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray that each of you will be anxiously engaged in a good cause and do many things of your own free will and bring about much righteousness during this time of your life.&nbsp; I testify that it will bring you joy and I testify that the power is in you to do so, &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>I'm honored to be with you here today and want to express my appreciation to those who make these weekly devotionals possible. It is an uplifting experience to gather weekly to hear words of inspiration and hope in a world so filled with degrading and demoralizing messages.<br /><br />You truly are an amazing group of young men and women. Elder Henry B. Eyring said of you,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"They will be natural leaders who know how to teach and how to learn. They will have the power to innovate and improve without requiring more of what money can buy. [They]...will become legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve." (2001)</em></p>
<p>You are being prepared to do a mighty work for the world and for the Lord. Your preparation is not solely academic; you are also being guided in the things of the Spirit. I am impressed with the emphasis you place on preparing for devotional by studying relevant scriptural passages in advance, bringing your scriptures with you, recording personal impressions on your "devotional notes page," and dressing in a reverent manner. It is my prayer that through our joint preparation we can create an environment where the Spirit can teach and enlighten us.</p>
<p><strong>Relative Wealth and Poverty<br /></strong>I would like to speak to you about a principle that is integral to the gospel and to the church: caring for the poor and needy. I realize that many of you feel like you are "poor college students" and are therefore needy. Many of you may be living below the poverty line, surviving on ramen noodles, sharing a bathroom with several roommates, and struggling to pay your tuition, books, and fees--not to mention trying to save enough money for a date. &nbsp;However, this period in your life shall be for a small moment. You will graduate and become some of the most educated individuals in the United States and in the world. Upon graduating from BYU-Idaho with your bachelor's degree, you will have more education than approximately 75% of all other American adults. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000).You will have substantially more education than the rest of the world. It is estimated that the average educational attainment worldwide is just under eight years. For you that would mean attending kindergarten through 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;grade. Because of your education, you will have greater earning power than most of the world. With your bachelor's degree you are likely to earn more than twice as much as your friends and acquaintances who dropped out of high school. Those with advanced professional degrees are likely to have salaries that quadruple those of high school drop outs. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals and families living in extreme poverty have circumstances that are difficult for us to comprehend. It is estimated that 1.1 billion people live on less than $2 a day and that one child dies every five seconds due to hunger or hunger-related causes (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2004; World Bank Development Indicators, 2010). &nbsp;Those who live in extreme poverty experience hunger, pervasive poor health, disabling conditions, illiteracy, denial of a basic education, loss of childhood, low skill levels, and early death. They are often vulnerable and powerless (Smith, 2008).&nbsp;<br /><br />Relatively speaking, you poor college students are positioning to be some of the wealthiest individuals in the world. &nbsp;The gap between you and those without education or opportunities for wealth is large. There was a similar economic situation in the year A.D. 29 with the Nephite people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"[They] began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches. Some were lifted up in pride and others were exceedingly humble...And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up." (3 Nephi 6:12-14)</em></p>
<p>How can great inequality in the land break up the church? Helaman tells us that the Nephites were broken up and defeated "because of the pride of their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek," among other sins (Helaman 4: 12-13).&nbsp;<br /><br />With the abundance of luxuries we enjoy in our modern society, it can be challenging to be "willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light" and be "willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort" (Mosiah 18:8-9). There are so many in the world who have burdens much heavier than ours: who mourn and are in need of comfort; who are poor not just economically, but educationally, emotionally, physically, socially, or spiritually.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Zion<br /></strong>This gap between the rich and powerful and the poor and vulnerable is depicted beautifully in the Manti temple. In this temple patrons go through stages of instruction in various rooms. In the first instruction room are wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling murals representing the creation, in the second room the Garden of Eden, and the third room the lone and dreary world. Murals of the world room in other temples portray barren earth, wild animals, and other symbols of the harshness of earth life. However, in the Manti temple, the world room depicts not the environmental effects of Adam's fall, but the human effects of living in the world.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Over 4000 square feet, this room was painted in slightly over 28 days in 1947 by a little woman named Minerva Teichert, assisted by Frank Stevens. As you enter the room, a Native American man greets temple patrons with arms wide open, as he welcomes on his right a pilgrim with a Bible and on his left a fur trapper with a gun and pelts. A mountain scene behind this Native American has often intrigued my husband and me. Time after time we have studied this mural, wondering if it is representing the Salt Lake Valley or the Sanpete Valley. It looks like the Manti temple on a grassy knoll, but the body of water looks more like the Great Salt Lake. I hadn't been able to figure it out until I read Doris Dant's essay on&nbsp;<em>Minerva Teichert's Temple Murals</em>&nbsp;found in a 1999 issue of&nbsp;<em>BYU Studies</em>.&nbsp; About this valley Minerva said, "We have not had in mind any city exactly. It could be Salt Lake, Logan, Provo, Bear Lake, Manti, but it is the place where the little stone cut out of the mountain without hands should begin to roll forth until it should cover the whole earth. Stevens adds, "It represents the Zion people, not merely the place, but the spirit of the people who build the place...Zion has to be established not only spiritually but physically." (Dant, 1999, p. 25).&nbsp;<br /><br />When we think of Zion, we often think of a location or of a specific group of people who are pure in heart. However, if we read more closely in Moses 7:18, we find there are at least three factors that constitute Zion: First, the people are of one heart and one mind; second, they dwell in righteousness; and third, there are no poor among them.&nbsp;<br /><br />The north wall of the Manti world room depicts this third factor, in terms of the lone and dreary world in which we live. Teichert wanted to show that the wealth of uncaring people is what truly makes the world lone and dreary. Our eyes are drawn immediately to the pageantry of nations--the rich and powerful from many lands parading in front of two large and spacious buildings. Yet in the shadows we see figures of the poor and needy, some of whom are begging for assistance. We see a young woman being sold into slavery for a jug of wine, a barefooted man who appears to be paralyzed beside a woman who is blind, a fatherless and homeless family with meager possessions, a mother with her son who has a physical disability, a lone soldier has who lost his leg in battle, a mother holding her son's limp body, a woman holding her head in despair, a gaudily dressed yet lonely woman, and a family of immigrants.&nbsp;<br /><br />The circumstances of the rich and mighty are contrasted with those of people who are experiencing significant difficulties in life. Yet only a king pays attention to the poor and needy. He tosses a few coins to a beggar without showing concern or compassion.&nbsp;<br /><br />All of the figures in this mural are surely alone in this dreary world, except Christopher Columbus, who bids farewell to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella as he ventures toward a new world--a land where people will care more for others than for themselves, a land where the poor and needy will be cared for, a land prepared for the establishment of Zion.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From Self-Centered to Christ-Centered<br /></strong>Zion cannot be established without caring for the poor and needy. The scriptures are replete with examples and admonitions. In my studies on this topic, I have not found one scripture that admonishes us to neglect the poor. Likewise, I have also not found one scripture that admonishes us to think more about ourselves, to acquire as many possessions as possible, to covet multiple comforts in life, or to live a life of leisure. We are taught to lose our lives for His sake, "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" (Matthew 16:25-26)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about how difficult this really is-to lose our lives for His sake--to think of God and others before we think of ourselves. On any given day, we must think of ourselves hundreds if not thousands of times, from the time we awake until the time we go to sleep. We often dream of ourselves too, so both our days and nights may be consumed with thinking about our temporal needs--what we will to eat, how we will dress, where we will go, what we will study, who we will hang out with, and so forth. It's difficult not to be self-centered when we're with ourselves 24/7. Imagine waking up each morning and not thinking about ourselves first. What would it be like if instead we thought of someone who was in need of our assistance, then let those thoughts of charity guide us to serve others throughout the remainder of each day?&nbsp;<br /><br />My favorite passage that relates to caring for those in need is found in Matthew 25. This chapter has three main themes that, if followed, will prepare us for the second coming of our Savior: We should be prepared, be wise with our monetary gifts, and care for others. If we do so, when the Son of man shall come in his glory we will be gathered at His right hand.</p>
<p><em>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:<br /></em><em>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger and ye took me in:<br /></em><em>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. (Matt. 25:34-40)</em></p>
<p><strong>Cycle of Caring<br /></strong>This scripture illustrates the difference between&nbsp;<em>caring about</em>&nbsp;others and&nbsp;<em>caring for&nbsp;</em>others. I believe we can&nbsp;<em>care about</em>&nbsp;others who are in unfavorable circumstances without being moved to action. We feel sorry for them. We may even pray for them to be comforted. However, when we&nbsp;<em>care for</em>&nbsp;others, we put forth effort. This effort, with love and compassion, can begin a cycle of caring that lifts those who are needy so they can be in a position to care for others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sister, Tami, is an example of one who is creating a cycle of caring. She doesn't give up on those who are often rejected by others. She volunteers most of her waking hours helping inmates in county jails and in state and federal prisons. My sister is making a difference in the lives of many women and men who have been lifted out of their spiritual and emotional poverty and are now in positions to serve others. One inmate she helped rescue from a constant cycle of incarceration is Davida Martinez. My sister shares this story:&nbsp;<br /><br />Davida didn't have many positive examples in her life as a child. Neglected and repeatedly abused as a child, &nbsp;Davida grew up in a family where drugs and addictions were promoted more than attending school. After 14 different arrests and time behind bars for drug-related crimes, Davida decided her children and grandchildren deserved a chance at living outside of our nation's jails and prisons. Now, clean for more than two years, Davida is leading the charge to empower incarcerated women. She travels from Compton, California to Wasatch County, Utah where she volunteers her time with incarcerated women, teaching them the tools she has used to strengthen her new life and the emerging success of her three sons and four grandchildren. In the face of temptation on an hourly basis, Davida remains stalwart in her mission to free incarcerated mothers and return them--clean--to live with their children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Davida still lives in the urban war zone.&nbsp; Just a few weeks ago cops were called to her trailer park for another neighborhood incident of lawlessness. She holds steady, however, becoming more and more the ray of hope for the community. As a result of her stand for sobriety, the youngsters in the neighborhood are hopping the fence and attending community college rather than stealing DVD players. Her friends are coming over to her house to help write letters of encouragement to inmates, not to share their needles. The mail she receives is about hope and change rather than where the next drug deal will go down.&nbsp;<br /><br />By all accounts, Davida Martinez has proven that change can and does happen.&nbsp; She is a ray of hope for the 2.3 men, women and children locked up in America today.&nbsp; With more than 80 percent of these individuals behind bars for illegal drug use and sales, Davida's ongoing sobriety speaks to the heart of the inmates.&nbsp;<br /><br />With 90 percent of all inmates returning to their communities at some point, Davida's success stands as a beacon through the long, dark night. Davida is changing the system from the inside out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Because of Davida's part in this cycle of caring, other inmates are gaining the knowledge, confidence, and skills necessary to live lives of service. Although incarcerated, these inmates are already giving to others. The women at the Wasatch County Jail recently held a fundraiser where they sold their handiwork to raise money for providing additional services for the inmates. They also help lift others by writing to inmates in other facilities, and they share their stories, poetry, and artwork to inspire others. The inmates' ongoing commitment to serving others gives new meaning to the verse "When saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?" (Matt. 25:39).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>All Can Give<br /></strong>Are any of us too poor, too uneducated, too destitute, too disabled, or too young to give? Did not the widow give more than the wealthy when she cast in the treasury her two mites?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"For they did cast in of their abundance, but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living" (Mark 12:44).</em></p>
<p>Our 13-year-old son, Logan, and I recently had an experience that taught us about giving "two mites." Usually Logan gets the same fast offering route, which encompasses a 4-block radius and takes about 20 minutes to cover (in a car). However, one Sunday he was given a different assignment. It is probably the most difficult route in the ward because it covers several miles along the highway with country-road addresses that are hard to find. Some of the fast offering envelopes didn't even have a house number, just a cryptic note such as "white house on highway." I sense that this is the route that most deacons don't want to get-it's reserved for the last deacon to pick up his envelopes from the Bishop. This assignment was a new experience for both of us-we didn't know most of the families on this route, and I don't have much experience finding homes in the country.&nbsp;<br /><br />We weren't having much success--if we were fortunate enough to find the right house, often nobody was home. We traversed interesting paths--we drove down a very long country lane beyond the "no trespassing sign" and over a rickety bridge to visit one family. At another home we were greeted by several large barking dogs followed by their owner, who cautioned us to stay in the car. As we were looking for another home, we only found a barn with several dogs devouring a helpless animal.&nbsp; Another home we visited had a dead deer hanging in the garage.&nbsp;<br /><br />After more than an hour searching for homes, Logan was becoming discouraged, but we kept persevering. When we arrived at the top of a hill overlooking the Sanpete valley, we noticed several non-functioning vehicles in the yard adjacent to an old run-down house.&nbsp; Logan was hesitant to go knock on the door. The wind was howling and the air crisp. As we sat in the car for several minutes discussing the importance of visiting everyone on the route, the homeowner pulled up in his car. He was an elderly man, a retired mining electrician, who lives by himself and rarely has visitors. He asked who we were, and I told him we were from the church and were collecting fast offerings. He said, "I ain't got no money."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />He was obviously lonely because he stood outside our car and talked with us for several minutes, telling us of the difficulties he was experiencing in life.&nbsp; Living alone without the benefits of family, he is worried about how all of his friends are dying. He worries about how expensive it is to live nowadays and how he has very little money to sustain himself. Yet he told us that he doesn't need anybody's help. Right before we were about to leave, he reached in his pocket and said, "This is all I got," and handed us two coins for his fast offerings.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we returned to the church, we told the counselor in the bishopric about this man, and encouraged a visit from his home teachers--sensing that he could benefit from regular visits. The counselor told us that this was the first time that any deacon had had the courage to visit him.&nbsp;<br /><br />This brother, although not active in attending church and obviously having few material possessions, gave his two mites to help the "poor and needy" in our ward. This gave new meaning to me of the verse:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"When saw we thee an hungred, and fed&nbsp;<em>thee?</em>&nbsp;or thirsty, and gave&nbsp;<em>thee</em>&nbsp;drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took&nbsp;<em>thee</em>&nbsp;in?" (Matt. 25:37-38)</p>
<p>I love the hymns that our primary children sing. One of my favorite songs as a child was "Give, Said the Little Stream." The text of this hymn was written in 1860 by Fanny Crosby, one of the most prolific hymnists in recorded history, who composed over 8,000 hymns. Now Fanny had several circumstances that could have prevented her from contributing to society. When she was six weeks old, an inflammation of the eye and its resulting treatment left her blind. Her father passed away when she was only one year old, leaving her mother to find employment in various towns, and leaving some of the care of Fanny to her grandmother. Because she was blind, Fanny did not receive a public education. It wasn't until she was 15 years old that she enrolled in the newly-opened New York Institute for the Blind. She could have been hindered in acquiring knowledge because of her limited access to printed material. Yet Fanny did not let her disability prevent her from helping others. She dedicated her life to serving others, as a poet, hymnist, teacher, lecturer, and provider of assistance for the sick, poor, and needy in blighted neighborhoods and missions (Blumhofer, 2005).</p>
<p>As a young child, Fanny loved being outdoors where she could feel the sunshine and the wind, and listen to the songs of the birds and the flowing brooks. She would often play "among the shallow streams that fed the Croton River" (Blumhofer, 2005, p. 14). On long walks her grandmother vividly described nature to her-the shapes and colors of leaves and trees, birdcalls, flowers-so vividly that Fanny could distinguish among them. Fanny experienced firsthand how streams are a life-giving resource, and her Biblical training gave her perspective that "there is something all can give." &nbsp;At age 8 she reflected on her condition:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Oh, what a happy soul I am,<br /></em><em>Although I cannot see,<br /></em><em>I am resolved in this world<br /></em><em>Contented I will be.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>How many blessings I enjoy<br /></em><em>That other people don't!</em><em><br /></em><em>To weep and sigh because I'm blind</em><em><br /></em><em>I cannot nor I won't. (Blumhofer, 2005, p. 26-27)</em></p>
<p>Fanny's love of nature and her optimistic attitude in spite of challenges make the meaning of "Give, Said the Little Stream" more powerful.&nbsp; This hymn teaches us three important messages. First, there is something that all can give. Second, when we give, we lift others. Third, living for God and others will bring such joy that we might be "singing all the day, 'give away, oh, give away.'"&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Many Ways to Give<br /></strong>We each have a role to play in establishing Zion. Individually and collectively we can care for the poor and the needy. We must first turn our hearts to our Father, who has "created all flesh," the rich and the poor being "as precious in his sight as the other" (Jacob 2:21). It is upon Him that we depend for our lives and for all that we have and are (see Mosiah 4:21), for we are all beggars, depending "upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind" (Mosiah 4:19). We do not fare in this life according to our own self-management, nor do we prosper according to our own genius, or conquer according to our own strength (see Alma 30:17).&nbsp; For "the Lord maketh poor and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up" (1 Sam. 2:7).</p>
<p>Being humble, we are more aware of the needs of others. Instead of simply praying for the poor and needy, we can pray that we may recognize the needs of the poor and make the time and effort to serve them. Spencer W. Kimball said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another mortal that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other...So often, our acts of service consist of simple encouragement or of giving mundane help with mundane tasks--but what glorious consequences can flow from mundane acts and from small but deliberate deeds!"&nbsp; (Spencer W. Kimball, The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 252).</em></p>
<p>We can give love, laughter, attention, and hope to others.&nbsp; We can provide leadership skills.&nbsp; We can tutor a student who is struggling in school or be a mentor to a child in need. We can provide a listening ear and a caring heart to one who is depressed. We can give more generous fast offerings. We can donate to causes that facilitate the cycle of caring such as the Perpetual Education Fund and the Student Legacy Endowment. We can make and assemble humanitarian kits for distribution worldwide. We can give up our nonessentials so we have more time and energy to serve others. &nbsp;Do we really have the time and money to waste on that which does not edify?&nbsp;<br /><br />I realize that many of you go to school full time and may also work full time. You may feel that you don't have time or money to give to others. Your days may be full with classes, studying, and work. May I submit to those of you in such circumstances that you reframe your daily activities so that they lead to service? As you sit through a lecture, read a chapter, take a test, do your job, or engage in other activities, ask yourself, "How can this experience help me to serve the Lord and His children better?" "How can my education here at BYU-Idaho benefit others besides myself?" Your life will have so much more meaning and you will experience so much more joy as you direct your personal efforts outward.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is my prayer that our hearts will be moved to establish Zion in our homes, our communities, and throughout the world. May we center our lives in Christ by joining in a cycle of caring, being free with our substance and lifting others that they may be rich like unto us (see Jacob 2:17), in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Relative Wealth and Poverty<br /></strong>I would like to speak to you about a principle that is integral to the gospel and to the church: caring for the poor and needy. I realize that many of you feel like you are "poor college students" and are therefore needy. Many of you may be living below the poverty line, surviving on ramen noodles, sharing a bathroom with several roommates, and struggling to pay your tuition, books, and fees--not to mention trying to save enough money for a date. &nbsp;However, this period in your life shall be for a small moment.

<p>Individuals and families living in extreme poverty have circumstances that are difficult for us to comprehend. It is estimated that 1.1 billion people live on less than $2 a day and that one child dies every five seconds due to hunger or hunger-related causes (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2004; World Bank Development Indicators, 2010). &nbsp;Those who live in extreme poverty experience hunger, pervasive poor health, disabling conditions, illiteracy, denial of a basic education, loss of childhood, low skill levels, and early death. They are often vulnerable and powerless (Smith, 2008).&nbsp;<br /><br />Relatively speaking, you poor college students are positioning to be some of the wealthiest individuals in the world. &nbsp;The gap between you and those without education or opportunities for wealth is large. There was a similar economic situation in the year A.D. 29 with the Nephite people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"[They] began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches. Some were lifted up in pride and others were exceedingly humble...And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up." (3 Nephi 6:12-14)</em></p>
<p>How can great inequality in the land break up the church? Helaman tells us that the Nephites were broken up and defeated "because of the pride of their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek," among other sins (Helaman 4: 12-13).&nbsp;<br /><br />With the abundance of luxuries we enjoy in our modern society, it can be challenging to be "willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light" and be "willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort" (Mosiah 18:8-9). There are so many in the world who have burdens much heavier than ours: who mourn and are in need of comfort; who are poor not just economically, but educationally, emotionally, physically, socially, or spiritually.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Zion<br /></strong>This gap between the rich and powerful and the poor and vulnerable is depicted beautifully in the Manti temple. In this temple patrons go through stages of instruction in various rooms. In the first instruction room are wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling murals representing the creation, in the second room the Garden of Eden, and the third room the lone and dreary world. Murals of the world room in other temples portray barren earth, wild animals, and other symbols of the harshness of earth life. However, in the Manti temple, the world room depicts not the environmental effects of Adam's fall, but the human effects of living in the world.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Over 4000 square feet, this room was painted in slightly over 28 days in 1947 by a little woman named Minerva Teichert, assisted by Frank Stevens. As you enter the room, a Native American man greets temple patrons with arms wide open, as he welcomes on his right a pilgrim with a Bible and on his left a fur trapper with a gun and pelts. A mountain scene behind this Native American has often intrigued my husband and me. Time after time we have studied this mural, wondering if it is representing the Salt Lake Valley or the Sanpete Valley. It looks like the Manti temple on a grassy knoll, but the body of water looks more like the Great Salt Lake. I hadn't been able to figure it out until I read Doris Dant's essay on&nbsp;<em>Minerva Teichert's Temple Murals</em>&nbsp;found in a 1999 issue of&nbsp;<em>BYU Studies</em>.&nbsp; About this valley Minerva said, "We have not had in mind any city exactly. It could be Salt Lake, Logan, Provo, Bear Lake, Manti, but it is the place where the little stone cut out of the mountain without hands should begin to roll forth until it should cover the whole earth. Stevens adds, "It represents the Zion people, not merely the place, but the spirit of the people who build the place...Zion has to be established not only spiritually but physically." (Dant, 1999, p. 25).&nbsp;<br /><br />When we think of Zion, we often think of a location or of a specific group of people who are pure in heart. However, if we read more closely in Moses 7:18, we find there are at least three factors that constitute Zion: First, the people are of one heart and one mind; second, they dwell in righteousness; and third, there are no poor among them.&nbsp;<br /><br />The north wall of the Manti world room depicts this third factor, in terms of the lone and dreary world in which we live. Teichert wanted to show that the wealth of uncaring people is what truly makes the world lone and dreary. Our eyes are drawn immediately to the pageantry of nations--the rich and powerful from many lands parading in front of two large and spacious buildings. Yet in the shadows we see figures of the poor and needy, some of whom are begging for assistance. We see a young woman being sold into slavery for a jug of wine, a barefooted man who appears to be paralyzed beside a woman who is blind, a fatherless and homeless family with meager possessions, a mother with her son who has a physical disability, a lone soldier has who lost his leg in battle, a mother holding her son's limp body, a woman holding her head in despair, a gaudily dressed yet lonely woman, and a family of immigrants.&nbsp;<br /><br />The circumstances of the rich and mighty are contrasted with those of people who are experiencing significant difficulties in life. Yet only a king pays attention to the poor and needy. He tosses a few coins to a beggar without showing concern or compassion.&nbsp;<br /><br />All of the figures in this mural are surely alone in this dreary world, except Christopher Columbus, who bids farewell to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella as he ventures toward a new world--a land where people will care more for others than for themselves, a land where the poor and needy will be cared for, a land prepared for the establishment of Zion.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From Self-Centered to Christ-Centered<br /></strong>Zion cannot be established without caring for the poor and needy. The scriptures are replete with examples and admonitions. In my studies on this topic, I have not found one scripture that admonishes us to neglect the poor. Likewise, I have also not found one scripture that admonishes us to think more about ourselves, to acquire as many possessions as possible, to covet multiple comforts in life, or to live a life of leisure. We are taught to lose our lives for His sake, "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" (Matthew 16:25-26)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about how difficult this really is-to lose our lives for His sake--to think of God and others before we think of ourselves. On any given day, we must think of ourselves hundreds if not thousands of times, from the time we awake until the time we go to sleep. We often dream of ourselves too, so both our days and nights may be consumed with thinking about our temporal needs--what we will to eat, how we will dress, where we will go, what we will study, who we will hang out with, and so forth. It's difficult not to be self-centered when we're with ourselves 24/7. Imagine waking up each morning and not thinking about ourselves first. What would it be like if instead we thought of someone who was in need of our assistance, then let those thoughts of charity guide us to serve others throughout the remainder of each day?&nbsp;<br /><br />My favorite passage that relates to caring for those in need is found in Matthew 25. This chapter has three main themes that, if followed, will prepare us for the second coming of our Savior: We should be prepared, be wise with our monetary gifts, and care for others. If we do so, when the Son of man shall come in his glory we will be gathered at His right hand.</p>
<p><em>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:<br /></em><em>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger and ye took me in:<br /></em><em>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. (Matt. 25:34-40)</em></p>
<p><strong>Cycle of Caring<br /></strong>This scripture illustrates the difference between&nbsp;<em>caring about</em>&nbsp;others and&nbsp;<em>caring for&nbsp;</em>others. I believe we can&nbsp;<em>care about</em>&nbsp;others who are in unfavorable circumstances without being moved to action. We feel sorry for them. We may even pray for them to be comforted. However, when we&nbsp;<em>care for</em>&nbsp;others, we put forth effort. This effort, with love and compassion, can begin a cycle of caring that lifts those who are needy so they can be in a position to care for others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sister, Tami, is an example of one who is creating a cycle of caring. She doesn't give up on those who are often rejected by others. She volunteers most of her waking hours helping inmates in county jails and in state and federal prisons. My sister is making a difference in the lives of many women and men who have been lifted out of their spiritual and emotional poverty and are now in positions to serve others. One inmate she helped rescue from a constant cycle of incarceration is Davida Martinez. My sister shares this story:&nbsp;<br /><br />Davida didn't have many positive examples in her life as a child. Neglected and repeatedly abused as a child, &nbsp;Davida grew up in a family where drugs and addictions were promoted more than attending school. After 14 different arrests and time behind bars for drug-related crimes, Davida decided her children and grandchildren deserved a chance at living outside of our nation's jails and prisons. Now, clean for more than two years, Davida is leading the charge to empower incarcerated women. She travels from Compton, California to Wasatch County, Utah where she volunteers her time with incarcerated women, teaching them the tools she has used to strengthen her new life and the emerging success of her three sons and four grandchildren. In the face of temptation on an hourly basis, Davida remains stalwart in her mission to free incarcerated mothers and return them--clean--to live with their children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Davida still lives in the urban war zone.&nbsp; Just a few weeks ago cops were called to her trailer park for another neighborhood incident of lawlessness. She holds steady, however, becoming more and more the ray of hope for the community. As a result of her stand for sobriety, the youngsters in the neighborhood are hopping the fence and attending community college rather than stealing DVD players. Her friends are coming over to her house to help write letters of encouragement to inmates, not to share their needles. The mail she receives is about hope and change rather than where the next drug deal will go down.&nbsp;<br /><br />By all accounts, Davida Martinez has proven that change can and does happen.&nbsp; She is a ray of hope for the 2.3 men, women and children locked up in America today.&nbsp; With more than 80 percent of these individuals behind bars for illegal drug use and sales, Davida's ongoing sobriety speaks to the heart of the inmates.&nbsp;<br /><br />With 90 percent of all inmates returning to their communities at some point, Davida's success stands as a beacon through the long, dark night. Davida is changing the system from the inside out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Because of Davida's part in this cycle of caring, other inmates are gaining the knowledge, confidence, and skills necessary to live lives of service. Although incarcerated, these inmates are already giving to others. The women at the Wasatch County Jail recently held a fundraiser where they sold their handiwork to raise money for providing additional services for the inmates. They also help lift others by writing to inmates in other facilities, and they share their stories, poetry, and artwork to inspire others. The inmates' ongoing commitment to serving others gives new meaning to the verse "When saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?" (Matt. 25:39).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>All Can Give<br /></strong>Are any of us too poor, too uneducated, too destitute, too disabled, or too young to give? Did not the widow give more than the wealthy when she cast in the treasury her two mites?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"For they did cast in of their abundance, but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living" (Mark 12:44).</em></p>
<p>Our 13-year-old son, Logan, and I recently had an experience that taught us about giving "two mites." Usually Logan gets the same fast offering route, which encompasses a 4-block radius and takes about 20 minutes to cover (in a car). However, one Sunday he was given a different assignment. It is probably the most difficult route in the ward because it covers several miles along the highway with country-road addresses that are hard to find. Some of the fast offering envelopes didn't even have a house number, just a cryptic note such as "white house on highway." I sense that this is the route that most deacons don't want to get-it's reserved for the last deacon to pick up his envelopes from the Bishop. This assignment was a new experience for both of us-we didn't know most of the families on this route, and I don't have much experience finding homes in the country.&nbsp;<br /><br />We weren't having much success--if we were fortunate enough to find the right house, often nobody was home. We traversed interesting paths--we drove down a very long country lane beyond the "no trespassing sign" and over a rickety bridge to visit one family. At another home we were greeted by several large barking dogs followed by their owner, who cautioned us to stay in the car. As we were looking for another home, we only found a barn with several dogs devouring a helpless animal.&nbsp; Another home we visited had a dead deer hanging in the garage.&nbsp;<br /><br />After more than an hour searching for homes, Logan was becoming discouraged, but we kept persevering. When we arrived at the top of a hill overlooking the Sanpete valley, we noticed several non-functioning vehicles in the yard adjacent to an old run-down house.&nbsp; Logan was hesitant to go knock on the door. The wind was howling and the air crisp. As we sat in the car for several minutes discussing the importance of visiting everyone on the route, the homeowner pulled up in his car. He was an elderly man, a retired mining electrician, who lives by himself and rarely has visitors. He asked who we were, and I told him we were from the church and were collecting fast offerings. He said, "I ain't got no money."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />He was obviously lonely because he stood outside our car and talked with us for several minutes, telling us of the difficulties he was experiencing in life.&nbsp; Living alone without the benefits of family, he is worried about how all of his friends are dying. He worries about how expensive it is to live nowadays and how he has very little money to sustain himself. Yet he told us that he doesn't need anybody's help. Right before we were about to leave, he reached in his pocket and said, "This is all I got," and handed us two coins for his fast offerings.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we returned to the church, we told the counselor in the bishopric about this man, and encouraged a visit from his home teachers--sensing that he could benefit from regular visits. The counselor told us that this was the first time that any deacon had had the courage to visit him.&nbsp;<br /><br />This brother, although not active in attending church and obviously having few material possessions, gave his two mites to help the "poor and needy" in our ward. This gave new meaning to me of the verse:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"When saw we thee an hungred, and fed&nbsp;<em>thee?</em>&nbsp;or thirsty, and gave&nbsp;<em>thee</em>&nbsp;drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took&nbsp;<em>thee</em>&nbsp;in?" (Matt. 25:37-38)</p>
<p>I love the hymns that our primary children sing. One of my favorite songs as a child was "Give, Said the Little Stream." The text of this hymn was written in 1860 by Fanny Crosby, one of the most prolific hymnists in recorded history, who composed over 8,000 hymns. Now Fanny had several circumstances that could have prevented her from contributing to society. When she was six weeks old, an inflammation of the eye and its resulting treatment left her blind. Her father passed away when she was only one year old, leaving her mother to find employment in various towns, and leaving some of the care of Fanny to her grandmother. Because she was blind, Fanny did not receive a public education. It wasn't until she was 15 years old that she enrolled in the newly-opened New York Institute for the Blind. She could have been hindered in acquiring knowledge because of her limited access to printed material. Yet Fanny did not let her disability prevent her from helping others. She dedicated her life to serving others, as a poet, hymnist, teacher, lecturer, and provider of assistance for the sick, poor, and needy in blighted neighborhoods and missions (Blumhofer, 2005).</p>
<p>As a young child, Fanny loved being outdoors where she could feel the sunshine and the wind, and listen to the songs of the birds and the flowing brooks. She would often play "among the shallow streams that fed the Croton River" (Blumhofer, 2005, p. 14). On long walks her grandmother vividly described nature to her-the shapes and colors of leaves and trees, birdcalls, flowers-so vividly that Fanny could distinguish among them. Fanny experienced firsthand how streams are a life-giving resource, and her Biblical training gave her perspective that "there is something all can give." &nbsp;At age 8 she reflected on her condition:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Oh, what a happy soul I am,<br /></em><em>Although I cannot see,<br /></em><em>I am resolved in this world<br /></em><em>Contented I will be.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>How many blessings I enjoy<br /></em><em>That other people don't!</em><em><br /></em><em>To weep and sigh because I'm blind</em><em><br /></em><em>I cannot nor I won't. (Blumhofer, 2005, p. 26-27)</em></p>
<p>Fanny's love of nature and her optimistic attitude in spite of challenges make the meaning of "Give, Said the Little Stream" more powerful.&nbsp; This hymn teaches us three important messages. First, there is something that all can give. Second, when we give, we lift others. Third, living for God and others will bring such joy that we might be "singing all the day, 'give away, oh, give away.'"&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Many Ways to Give<br /></strong>We each have a role to play in establishing Zion. Individually and collectively we can care for the poor and the needy. We must first turn our hearts to our Father, who has "created all flesh," the rich and the poor being "as precious in his sight as the other" (Jacob 2:21). It is upon Him that we depend for our lives and for all that we have and are (see Mosiah 4:21), for we are all beggars, depending "upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind" (Mosiah 4:19). We do not fare in this life according to our own self-management, nor do we prosper according to our own genius, or conquer according to our own strength (see Alma 30:17).&nbsp; For "the Lord maketh poor and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up" (1 Sam. 2:7).</p>
<p>Being humble, we are more aware of the needs of others. Instead of simply praying for the poor and needy, we can pray that we may recognize the needs of the poor and make the time and effort to serve them. Spencer W. Kimball said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another mortal that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other...So often, our acts of service consist of simple encouragement or of giving mundane help with mundane tasks--but what glorious consequences can flow from mundane acts and from small but deliberate deeds!"&nbsp; (Spencer W. Kimball, The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 252).</em></p>
<p>We can give love, laughter, attention, and hope to others.&nbsp; We can provide leadership skills.&nbsp; We can tutor a student who is struggling in school or be a mentor to a child in need. We can provide a listening ear and a caring heart to one who is depressed. We can give more generous fast offerings. We can donate to causes that facilitate the cycle of caring such as the Perpetual Education Fund and the Student Legacy Endowment. We can make and assemble humanitarian kits for distribution worldwide. We can give up our nonessentials so we have more time and energy to serve others. &nbsp;Do we really have the time and money to waste on that which does not edify?&nbsp;<br /><br />I realize that many of you go to school full time and may also work full time. You may feel that you don't have time or money to give to others. Your days may be full with classes, studying, and work. May I submit to those of you in such circumstances that you reframe your daily activities so that they lead to service? As you sit through a lecture, read a chapter, take a test, do your job, or engage in other activities, ask yourself, "How can this experience help me to serve the Lord and His children better?" "How can my education here at BYU-Idaho benefit others besides myself?" Your life will have so much more meaning and you will experience so much more joy as you direct your personal efforts outward.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is my prayer that our hearts will be moved to establish Zion in our homes, our communities, and throughout the world. May we center our lives in Christ by joining in a cycle of caring, being free with our substance and lifting others that they may be rich like unto us (see Jacob 2:17), in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Emeritus General Authority Seventy</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>President Clark, members of the faculty, administrators, staff and students of this remarkable university, Sister Christensen and I are excited and honored to be with you in this sacred setting.<br /><br />&nbsp;Although I have driven through Rexburg on a few occasions over the years, I have never walked the pathways and enjoyed the sights of this lovely campus since our daughter was a student here many years ago.&nbsp; For us this has been a delightful visit in every respect and we are excited for these moments with you during this devotional experience.&nbsp; We express gratitude to the many who have made our visit so enjoyable.&nbsp; Thank you, and how we appreciate your kindness.&nbsp;<br /><br />The idea that the Lord, working through inspired leadership, would provide for a devotional hour each week in an academic setting has to be somewhat unique.&nbsp; It is a powerful indication of how much Father in Heaven loves you and desires to bless you with His Spirit. You are to be commended for the importance you place on matters that are truly important and enduring in your personal development.&nbsp; Undoubtedly your spiritual attainments and experiences will contribute greatly to your academic success.&nbsp; In fact, that concept fits well into the subject I would like to discuss with you today.&nbsp;<br /><br />You play a vital part in the on rolling purposes of this university in becoming what the Lord truly wants it and you to be.&nbsp; &nbsp;The success of such an endeavor will in reality be the sum of the daily occurrences in each of your lives as you reflect upon who you are and what your studies will achieve now and in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;Each of you must surely be familiar with President Eyring's devotional address of September 2001 entitled,&nbsp;<em>A Steady, Upward Course</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />You will recall that on that occasion he referred to the student's efforts to prepare themselves for their devotional experience with him and then he made a promise to any student whose future efforts would extend above and beyond what might otherwise be expected of them.&nbsp; Whether in dress or scholarship he made this promise,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br />I would like to speak to you about a subject closely related to President Eyring's prophecy regarding your potential to influence others around you, and by extension through your collective efforts, the entire world.&nbsp; I would like to preface my remarks with a personal experience and then some insights regarding the importance of distinguishing between two opposites that we often encounter in our society and are clearly described in scriptural accounts. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A few years ago I was teaching an Old Testament Gospel Doctrine class.&nbsp; I had to be absent for a couple of Sundays and so I sought someone to substitute in my absence.&nbsp; I found a sister who was excited to teach the class until I told her that the two lessons she would teach would be the first two lessons from the writings of Isaiah.&nbsp; Her eyes glazed over and I thought she was going into cardiac arrest!&nbsp; She said, "You have to be kidding! I can scarcely understand Isaiah. How will I ever be able to teach those lessons?"&nbsp;<br /><br />In no way do I consider myself an authority on the teachings of Isaiah.&nbsp; However, like you, I recognize the powerful feelings I receive when I read and study his sacred record.&nbsp; Although I cannot be certain that I always comprehend the full extent and continuing impact of his teachings, I bask in the warm glow of truth as the Spirit bears witness of its relevance. Nephi expressed similar feelings for Isaiah's teachings when he wrote,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><br />Isaiah's record written approximately 150 years before Nephi lived was invaluable to Lehi's family, and Nephi knew that it would be even more precious to those of later dispensations, especially to us.&nbsp; Again Nephi recorded,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><br />I am certain we will all be blessed by Isaiah's words for he and Nephi knew we would be personal observers of their fulfillment and would easily find application of his teachings in our day<em>.</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />I now refer to a verse whose importance was an admonition to them and should be immediately obvious to us.&nbsp; Do you recognize this counsel of Isaiah?&nbsp; Have you seen evidence of it in our day? &nbsp;Said Isaiah,<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><br />Perhaps there has never been a time in recorded history that the conditions described by Isaiah have been more apparent.&nbsp; I do not want to misinterpret or be too judgmental.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I do not remember in my lifetime a more pervasive effort in our society to call evil good and good evil.&nbsp; If we allow it, the ever insidious blanket of evil and darkness would envelope us as well, for there are far too many who promote the destruction of righteousness and would substitute darkness, evil and bitterness in its place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There is so much goodness to be found among members of the Church and in society in general.&nbsp; We have all met remarkable people whose goodness is immediately identifiable and lifts and blesses all around them.&nbsp; As President Eyring counseled, it is imperative that we all seek diligently to identify, appreciate and acquire every quality of goodness.&nbsp; Then having done so, others will be richly rewarded through our efforts to lift them to that same level of respect, decency and integrity.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to share with you some examples of goodness that have inspired me and from which I believe we can all benefit.&nbsp; By so doing I am confident that we can disrupt the designs of the adversary and bring joy and everlasting happiness to ourselves and others around us.&nbsp; If we are to fend off the insidious designs of the adversary, we must first have faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This is an undergirding principle that must guide any discussion regarding establishing righteousness in our lives.&nbsp; Without faith in the teachings of Jesus Christ and his prophets, we will find it difficult, if not impossible, to always recognize that evil is evil and should never be mistaken for good.&nbsp; We must know that we can always trust and look to God for direction in any aspect of our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Helaman assured us with these words,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br />Moses and Joshua would have found their task impossible had they not known with certainty that the great Jehovah was continually guiding their efforts.&nbsp; Samuel, the future prophet of such a tender age, would not have heard nor understood the voice of the Lord had he not had the instruction and the faith to say "speak Lord, for Thy servant heareth".&nbsp; Lehi's family would not have obtained nor benefited from the Brass Plates had the Spirit not shown him their value to his family. The construction of a ship by unskilled shipbuilders would not have been successful without Nephi's faith to go into the mount oft to seek direction from the Lord. The arrival in the Promised Land would have been more improbable without humble prayers that the Lord would guide their remarkable ship.&nbsp;<br /><br />The accomplishment of their tasks became possible only when motivated by faith; a faith that burned deep in their souls and cast away any doubts as to what the Lord expected of them.&nbsp; So it is with each of us.&nbsp; Our lives can be an example of personal strength to ourselves and others around us.&nbsp; When we have such faith, nothing will be impossible and such achievement will be sweet and long lasting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Honoring Your Name Will Strengthen You Against Evil</strong></p>
<p>Goodness, decency and integrity must begin with an appreciation for the sacred origin and nature of your name and heritage.&nbsp; The Proverbs teach that, "A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches..." (Proverbs 22:1)<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />I recall a wonderful stake president who after ordaining and setting apart a bishop would often counsel the bishop's children regarding their family name. &nbsp;&nbsp;He would say them,&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>"You should not feel compelled to be good just because your father is now the bishop. Remember, you must always choose to be good because your name is Jones (or whatever their last name), not because your father is now the bishop."</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />Helaman's sons, Nephi and Lehi, at one point were deeply discouraged in their ministry.&nbsp; They found comfort when they remembered the reason their father had named them Nephi and Lehi.&nbsp; Listen to Helaman's comforting words to his sons regarding their names,</p>
<p><br /><br />Your posterity is depending on you to be powerful examples of goodness so that when they hear or remember your name, they will also remember your worthy endeavors.&nbsp; Every choice you make in your lives will reflect upon you and them. &nbsp;&nbsp;Many who may never know you personally will honor your name because of what they have heard or read about you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Many years ago I had a remarkable employee who was not a member of the Church.&nbsp; He was born in Texas and was an older gentleman of Latin descent.&nbsp; He was very short in stature and a decorated veteran of WWII. His stature and demeanor was not what one would usually associate with hardened veterans and heroic deeds.&nbsp; Because of his stature, the people in our community knew him as "Little John" or "Juanito" to his Latin friends. &nbsp;&nbsp;He had the most pleasing personality of anyone I have ever known; gentle and kind; considerate and deeply respectful.&nbsp;<br /><br />Knowing "Little John" as I did, I often thought to myself; how I would have loved to have known his parents!&nbsp; Undoubtedly his quiet and gentle demeanor came from the powerful example and teaching of parents acquired during his formative years in a loving and respectful home and family.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Like "Little John" your name will be forever remembered by so many when you too are always kind and respectful of others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goodness and Virtue are Enduring Traits of a Disciple of Christ</strong></p>
<p><br /><br />You are examples of the good seed frequently spoken of in the Savior's parables.&nbsp; You are acquiring the attributes now that will, like all good seeds, endow you with the potential to yield far more abundantly than you can ever imagine.&nbsp; You must endeavor to avoid the tragedy described by the Apostle James when he said, "Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin." (James 4:17)&nbsp;<br /><br />There is much that surrounds us that is virtuous and lovely. Our attention and efforts should be continually focused on acquiring and developing Christ-like attributes.&nbsp; As you do so you will also recognize and admire the good that is apparent in the lives of our associates.&nbsp; Goodness and righteousness are the results of obedient and worthy living.&nbsp; Living Christ centered lives will require our most serious effort in accepting and living His doctrine.&nbsp; Such attributes will bring you enduring joy on a daily basis, and will insure that you will have continuing positive experiences as you nurture such attributes with exactness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Integrity--Another Trait That is so Desperately Needed in Every Aspect of Our Society</strong></p>
<p>Isaiah on another occasion speaking of our day said that, "...honorable men are famished and their multitude dried up with thirst." (Isaiah 5: 13)&nbsp;<br /><br />We have recently heard of well-known or otherwise honorable men whose personal behaviors demonstrate the lack of integrity mentioned by Isaiah.&nbsp; Such examples are far too plentiful and we are subjected to a seemingly steady cadence of such corruption.&nbsp; What we do not hear often enough are the reports of those whose lives and examples of integrity that are also plentiful in our society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you heard a few weeks ago of Brian Davis, a British professional golfer who in a PGA tournament was on the verge of his first tournament victory and a one million dollar first prize.&nbsp; &nbsp;On the first hole of a playoff, his ball bounced off the green and rolled into some nearby weeds and grass.&nbsp; When he tried to punch the ball back onto the green, he realized his club may have grazed a nearby weed; a violation of PGA rules requiring a two stroke penalty, and in a playoff, certain defeat.&nbsp;<br /><br />The officials had not seen the violation; only Davis recognized the possible infraction when as he hit the ball he thought he saw movement of the obstruction out of the corner of his eye. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Immediately after the shot, he notified the official who with the help of slow motion television replays confirmed the violation.&nbsp; When the infraction was confirmed, Davis conceded the victory to his opponent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brian Davis is reported to have said after the tournament that had he not reported the violation, he would never have been able to have lived with himself.&nbsp;A million dollar first prize lost because honesty was more important than wealth!&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;Such stories of integrity are multitude around us but in the din of world events reported on the six-o-clock news, too often only the revolting seems to be considered newsworthy.&nbsp; The world will be forever indebted to the Brian Davis's of the world whose integrity makes them truly worthy of emulation by all.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Another Powerful Influence for Good is the Enduring Power of Example</strong></p>
<p>I remember that as a young man I was awed how in our rural community on a Sunday morning all was quiet; hardly a sound to be heard in any direction; never a tractor, combine, sprayer or other type of machinery in motion.&nbsp; I hasten to say that our community was not a predominantly LDS community.&nbsp; I marveled how my neighbors of every denomination respected and observed the Lord's commandment to honor and observe the Sabbath Day.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now over 50 years later the Sabbath respect I observed years ago seems to no longer exist.&nbsp; Judging by the din of a Sunday morning in that community today as compared to the past, it is apparent that the command of the Lord regarding respect for His holy day has been forgotten or ignored.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I was, therefore, deeply impressed when I read an account of Sabbath observance from an article in a Church Magazine.&nbsp;<br /><br />Those of you who know something about agricultural communities know that haying season on a ranch can be quite challenging.&nbsp; The hay is ready for baling when the dew settles on and moistens the hay so as to not shatter the precious leaves during baling.&nbsp; After a warm summer day, the dew rarely comes until near or after nightfall.&nbsp;<br /><br />The author of the story wrote that many years before he had determined to always observe a proper Sabbath, no matter the consequences.&nbsp; One Saturday evening during haying season when the conditions were right, he went out late in the evening to bale knowing that he would not have sufficient time to complete the work before the Sabbath began.&nbsp; Given the pressing nature of the harvest, he said it was a temptation to continue working beyond the midnight hour.&nbsp;<br /><br />As the baling proceeded he could see in the distance the tractor headlights of his neighbor also taking advantage of the favorable harvest conditions. Knowing that his neighbor was a dear friend and member of the Church, he wondered what his neighbor would do as midnight approached.&nbsp;<br /><br />Near midnight he pulled his tractor up to his truck and shut off the lights and motor. &nbsp;Almost immediately he noticed that his neighbor's tractor lights had gone off as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some years later after telling the story in a Sacrament Meeting he turned to his neighbor who was then the bishop of their ward and asked if he remembered that night when both were out baling hay.&nbsp; The bishop nodded that he did remember and then said, [Yes, I remember because] "I didn't have a watch and I was watching you." (Lynn Jensen, "'I Was Watching You',"&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>, Aug. 2006, 69)&nbsp;<br /><br />You have undoubtedly had such experiences in your lives and will continue to do so in the future.&nbsp; Obedience to Gospel principles provides us the opportunity to truly define our values and thus bless ourselves and others.&nbsp; You will never know who is watching you and who will be influenced to do right because of your example.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The "Exemplary Husband" Contest</strong></p>
<p>A few weeks ago there appeared in our local newspaper the account of a woman who while reading a magazine in her doctor's office waiting room read of an "Exemplary Husband " contest being sponsored by the magazine and inviting entries to be submitted for the contest.&nbsp; The woman returned home, wrote a description of the admirable traits of her thoughtful husband and without informing him she mailed it and immediately forgot about her entry.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several weeks later she was notified that her entry had been selected as a finalist in the contest.&nbsp; Her husband was embarrassed and she was justifiably pleased and proud.&nbsp; Listen to her description of her husband written in her entry.</p>
<p><br /><br />As I read the account of this wonderful couple I was thrilled as I'm certain others were also.&nbsp; I don't know that they are members of the Church, but the power of their example is so desperately needed and appreciated regardless of religious affiliation. O how this world that lacks so much kindness and civility in marriage is blessed by the example of that couple and so many others like them. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Neal A. Maxwell wrote of the influence of couples who marry in the temple, honor their covenants and are examples of righteous marriage to the rest of the world,</p>
<p><br /><br />I close my remarks with these words of the Lord spoken to you of this dispensation.</p>
<p><br /><br />Brothers and Sisters, you stand today in Holy Places.&nbsp; There is no more powerful force for good than the righteous example of persons like you who have Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ sufficient to follow His example in all things; who know and understand their eternal destiny and have determined in advance that they will respect their names as a symbol of virtue, integrity and example; ones who will always stand in Holy Places and never be moved.&nbsp;<br /><br />I so testify and bear witness of these truths, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, what a great privilege it is to be here with you today. I'm grateful to be here with my beautiful wife and with a number of our children and our grandchildren.&nbsp; We are delighted to be here.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm getting old. When we talk about grandchildren and great grandchildren, President Clark, that tells something about someone. And as you get older you forget a number of things and so as I got up, just prior to getting up, Sister Hammond leaned over to me and said, "Don't be stiff."&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not sure what that means. It reminded me, however, of a time when Henry Moyle was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and Brother Moyle had a tendency to be a little strict, and a little bit straight and stiff, and very seldom joked.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />And his beautiful wife said to him one day, "Henry, now you are speaking at conference. And I want you to get up and tell a joke.&nbsp; All the brethren on occasion tell a joke, and it's your turn." And he said, "Well, I don't think I can do that."&nbsp; And she said, "Well, yes you can. You tell a joke."&nbsp;<br /><br />So conference rolled around and he got up and he told a joke. The first time in his existence. And he came home afterward and waited for the accolades and she said to him," Henry, don't ever tell another joke."&nbsp; And I don't suppose he ever did again. But anyway, I will try not to be "too stiff and straight today" and yet I have a message to give to you.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have stood at this pulpit many times. I want you to know that at the outset. And I never cease to feel the spirit that comes from all of you wonderful students, and today I salute you.&nbsp; I take my hat off to you. I want you to know that we love you and we are proud of you; and we know of your struggles and your accomplishments. And so today as you are here, we congratulate you.&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't know how I can possibly convey to you, dear students, the feelings that enter my heart as Sister Hammond and I return to this remarkable campus.&nbsp;<br /><br />Almost everything has changed since that incredible Fall of 1951. There were really only two structures of any significance here then, the old Gym and the Spori building.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was completely intimidated by the ponderous size of the student body, a whopping 384 eager bodies, scattered through the four academic levels. Some of you might smile at my timidity, until I reveal to you that there were only six of us in my graduating class from high school. My children were very impressed with the fact that their father was the salutatorian of his graduating class- then they found his yearbook.&nbsp;<br /><br />Although slightly nervous with the prospect of entering college, I still felt great surges of exhilaration and anticipation because I had come to play basketball! I live for basketball! After a rather remarkable high school career, Ricks College gave me a scholarship to do the thing that I loved most - play ball. Nothing could have been better! I was on top of the world!&nbsp;<br /><br />That summer I had worked on a section crew for the Union Pacific Railroad swinging a spike mall and shoveling gravel. I felt strong and healthy, besides the pay was good and I had saved nearly every penny that I had earned - more than $1500.00.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was in late October. Another athlete and I had found part-time work loading beets onto railroad cars at a facility just south of Rexburg. We had finished our shift, jumped on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and started back toward town. I sat behind him on the bike. The night was stormy, windy and cold. Rain with intermittent snow blew into our faces making it extremely difficult to see anything ahead of us. Then it happened!&nbsp;<br /><br />A car traveling south on Highway 91 began a left turn at the Lyman junction. It was not his fault. He could not see us. We slammed head-first into the grill of that car.&nbsp; Still to this day, I sometimes see in my minds eye those two head-lights getting closer, closer and closer and hearing that horrible mind-shattering crash.&nbsp;<br /><br />As though from a sling-shot, I was catapulted over that car. My right foot was thrust through the wind-shield, nearly cutting the foot off. Then, I flew more than seventy feet through the air, finally landing on my back in the middle of the highway. I tried to get up! I wanted to run! Frantically, my arms lifted my body slightly up from the wet pavement, but it was no use, my pelvis was broken and my back and legs battered and twisted. I slumped back down. I was cold. I began to slip in and out of consciousness.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the hospital the doctors debated whether to amputate my injured foot or try to save it. An inspired priesthood blessing was given by my father and my bishop. In that blessing, I was told that my foot would heal and that eventually, I would be able to walk and run again.&nbsp; Following the blessing, my wonderful mother informed the physicians that she would not allow them to amputate, that they were to sew the torn foot together and the Lord would do the rest. I am so grateful today, for the power of the priesthood and the absolute faith of a mother. In the days that followed, the reality of my horrible situation became shockingly apparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For two months I lay, virtually immobile, in a hospital bed in St. Anthony, Idaho. Just before my eighteenth birthday in mid-December I returned home. Christmas that year was not a happy one. My basketball scholarship was revoked. I had missed a full semester of school. All the money I had saved was gone. The prospect of six months on crutches had left me discouraged and miserable.&nbsp;<br /><br />But, miracles do happen! The tender mercies of Jesus Christ are extended to His children! In the succeeding months my mangled foot did heal! I returned to Ricks in the Fall of '52' and actually I played ball on the Junior Varsity team. I met a beautiful girl who changed the entire prospect of my life. She encouraged me to serve a mission, assuring me that she would wait faithfully for those two and half years while I preached the gospel to the Spanish-speaking people in Texas and New Mexico.&nbsp;<br /><br />My whole attitude changed in the mission field! Out of tragedy and pain, depressed, and beaten there emerged in me an inner Spirit of excitement - a desire to move forward and upward, to learn, to progress, and to accomplish something of worth to the Lord and to His Church. The Holy Ghost came into my life. I discovered that I loved to teach the gospel. I found immense joy in my interaction with the Mexican people.&nbsp;<br /><br />After returning home, that wonderful girl, who by the way had waited faithfully, and I were married in the Salt Lake Temple. And so began our journey in life together, not without its bumps, but an UPWARD journey of joy and gladness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now we are in the year 2010. There is a tendency for each one of us to look back at the past years of our life and to make a critical evaluation of what we have accomplished. There is nothing wrong with making such a personal evaluation. Nor is there anything wrong comparing the PAST to the NOW. However, I am constrained to suggest that each one of us look to the FUTURE. For as we gaze ahead we also tend to LOOK UP and that is where our focus should be during the next hundred years--not backward and DOWN, but forward and UP. All of you will remember this amazing inspired pronouncement by the Prophet Joseph Smith, "Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory!" (D&amp;C 128:22) This has to be without question, one of my favorite scriptures.</p>
<p>I have always been intrigued by a very interesting account in the Old Testament. As the House of Israel wandered in the wilderness during those forty years of waiting, they were attacked by poisonous serpents. Many of the people suffered and died. The Lord commanded Moses, the great prophet of deliverance, to construct a serpent of brass and to raise it high on a pole. If those who had been bitten would simply lift up their eyes and behold the brazen serpent, they would be healed and live. (Numbers 21: 7-9)&nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of this remarkable phenomenon, Nephi, the great prophet of the Book of Mormon, said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And after they were bitten he prepared a way that they might be healed; and the labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished." (1 Nephi 17:41)</em></p>
<p>It is certain to the members of this Church that the brass serpent was a type or symbol of Jesus Christ. With all of His love and concern He stands above us ready to heal our wounds, if we will just cast our eyes UPWARD to see Him. But because the way is so simple, there are very few souls today who will make the effort to turn their eyes and their attention from the handmade gods of this world to see the Eternal Christ who can save them.&nbsp;<br /><br />So examine the PAST, but look to the FUTURE! We need to let old things go! I have learned from long experience that there are some things which afflict us that are just too difficult to cast off by relying solely upon our own efforts. Think for a moment of your personal challenges: that habitual sin which you have tried over and over again to repent of, but which seems to return again and again to afflict you; some painful, reoccurring remembrances from the distant past, which try as you might to erase from your memory, keep coming back to torment your tender heart; that dark emotional stress which grips your mind, from which there seems to be no escape. Is there no escape for you? Must you be forever bound by such awful snares? To you I say, emphatically, NO! There is a way! It is simple and frankly, it is simply wonderful!&nbsp;<br /><br />We, everyone of us, must simply raise our eyes upward to the One perfect source of infinite help, the Savior, Jesus Christ, He who was lifted up upon the cross to relieve us of our pain, our suffering, and bring us all to Him (3 Nephi 27:14). "For it is by grace that we are saved," Nephi said, and then to emphasize our own feeble nature, our complete reliance on His grace, he added the telling phrase, "after all we can do." (2 Nephi 25: 23)&nbsp;<br /><br />As you look UP to the Savior to heal you, here are a few things I would suggest you do:</p>
<p>The story is told that on one occasion the Prophet Joseph Smith saw in a vision at least nine of the Twelve Apostles in a foreign land.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"He saw them gathered in a circle, without shoes, beaten, tattered, discouraged. Standing above them in the air was the Lord Jesus Christ. And it was made known to the Prophet that Christ yearned to show himself to them, to reach down and lift them. But they did not see him." (Truman Madsen, The Highest in Us, Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, Inc., 1978, p. 85)</em></p>
<p>The Prophet could never speak of this vision without weeping for the awful tragedy of those that he loved so much being in such a terrible condition, and only have to look up to see the Lord to receive his tender mercies. But they would not! I believe that it is easy to LOOK UP to the Savior. As you do, you will see Him standing with His arms out-stretched trying to help you with all of your earthly challenges. He wants you to be happy whatever your situation in life!&nbsp;<br /><br />So many of you are married, I believe about 23%. Everyday, there are worries about finding work, paying the bills, crying babies - mostly at night, getting enough sleep, studying, putting gas in the car, going on a weekly date to the Temple -funny, most of these challenges apply to married and singles alike!&nbsp; Anyway, the advantage those of us have who are older is that we have been there and done that. I can honestly say that those beginning years for Sister Hammond and me were among the best--filled with joy and happiness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you remember, from the Book of Mormon, that period of awful war, deceit and treachery, when the Nephite dissenters under the command of Amalickiah, seized control of the Lamanite armies and wrecked havoc among the Nephite nation? The Nephites had become despised because of their belief in Christ. It was that time when a great leader, Captain Moroni, raised up on a pole, the "title of liberty". It became a standard for the believers and they covenanted with the Lord that they would maintain their rights, their religion and never forsake the Lord their God (Alma 46: 20-21).&nbsp; The people "came running" to support the cause, willing to lay down their own lives in defense of God, their religion, and their families. In many ways, it was one of the most miserable of all times and yet, as was recorded, "But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni..." (Alma 50:23)&nbsp;<br /><br />And so it is, happiness can be found amidst our trials and troubles, our pains and suffering. It is easy! We just need to LOOK UP to our Savior, never forsake Him and let His sweetness and love wipe away all our tears and bring eternal happiness to our souls.<br /><br />Before I let you go, I must bear my testimony to you as a special witness to Jesus Christ. He is our Savior.&nbsp; He knows us intimately.&nbsp; He understands your situations.&nbsp; He is so real, that sometimes I feel if we would just all look up, we would see Him; in reality, with His body and in His glory.&nbsp; But we must do it.&nbsp; I love Him so.&nbsp; I witness to you that He is our Redeemer, that His life was given to us to save us and to bless us. I have knowledge that this is very sacred to me of His reality.&nbsp; I bear that solemn witness to you and express my love to every one of you and do it humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>My dear, young brothers and sisters, it is wonderful to be with you today.&nbsp; I am honored and humbled by this opportunity.&nbsp; In my preparations for this devotional, I have sought the guidance of the Holy Spirit and felt his influence regarding the message I should speak about today.&nbsp; I am thankful for the prayers on my behalf, and in turn pray that the Holy Spirit may be with us this hour, that we may each be taught by the Spirit and know of those things we can and must do to make our lives better.<br /><br />You are a magnificent sight.&nbsp; I am always inspired by who you are and what you represent.&nbsp; As we sang at the beginning of this devotional, you truly are the Hope of Israel, Zion's Army, and Children of the Promised Day.&nbsp; You have likely heard many times that you are a Royal Generation.&nbsp; You&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;the future, and from where I stand today, the future looks bright and glorious.&nbsp; These titles are often applied to the rising generation, but my question to you today is:&nbsp; Do&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;believe them?&nbsp; Do you believe that you actually&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;a Royal Generation?&nbsp; And do your outward actions and appearance reflect your inner belief in those appellations?&nbsp;<br /><br />As you ponder on who you are and what you are, I want you to know that I believe in you!&nbsp; I see the goodness you exhibit and know that you have a strong desire to serve the Lord with all your heart, mind, and strength.&nbsp; So, I truly believe that the future is bright, because of you, the Hope of Israel. &nbsp;Now, that is not to say that you will not see struggles and difficulties in your life; on the contrary, you will be tested to the limits of your endurance because your Heavenly Father wants to know what you are willing to do.&nbsp; He wants to know if you will serve Him at all times, in all places, and in all things.&nbsp; Are you willing to do that, now and in the future?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In a few days, some of you will be graduating (hopefully) and leaving this very unique university.&nbsp; Where you are going and what you will be doing have probably already been determined.&nbsp; My hope is that being here has made a difference in your life, that you have allowed the BYU-Idaho experience to change you and the Spirit of Ricks to permeate your life.&nbsp; For others of you, this experience is still very new.&nbsp; My advice is that you take full advantage of being here, and allow yourself to be molded and directed and guided into becoming what the Lord wants you to become.&nbsp;<br /><br />In this life, it is the decisions we make, the ideas we embrace, the attitudes we uphold, and what we choose to do each day that will in the end define the success of our mortal sojourn.&nbsp; Life truly is a journey, a pathway that each of us must walk.&nbsp; You only get one shot at it, so be cautious in how you spend your time in this life.&nbsp; When we are young, as you are, the end seems a long ways off; we perceive that there is an abundance of time at our disposal and that we can attend to more serious matters later.&nbsp; It is difficult to see very far down the road at what lies ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is because of that limited vision that it is all the more important to make good choices now, to follow the counsel and advice of our prophets and leaders, who have traveled further down the mortal path and know the pitfalls that lie in your way, and to seek daily to live worthy of the Holy Spirit, so that we may be properly guided and nurtured through mortality.&nbsp; Let the Lord direct you in your life.&nbsp; Trust in Him, seek to do His will, choose to be good, and He will kindly, lovingly, and gently lead you. &nbsp;Your journey may take some unexpected turns, but accept them and trust in the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes, especially when we are young, we fear that if we don't participate in certain activities, act in a certain way, or go and see certain events that we are missing out on what life has to offer.&nbsp; But I promise that if you will submit yourself to the Lord and always do His will, He will bless and enrich your life in ways that you cannot see at this time.&nbsp; You will find greater joy and happiness in following the Lord than you will in any earth-bound experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To illustrate the importance of making good choices in life, I will use a personal experience.&nbsp; When I was a younger man, not much older than you are now, I enjoyed hiking and backpacking into remote areas.&nbsp; I have always found the beauty and grandeur of nature inspiring and renewing.&nbsp; A number of years ago, two of my friends, Larry and Dave, and I decided to hike the Thunder River Trail off the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; This is not an easy hike and it requires very careful planning.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The trail starts at Monument Point, at an elevation of 7200 ft., while the elevation of the Colorado River at its confluence with Thunder River is only 2000 ft.&nbsp; That is a one mile vertical change in elevation over a horizontal distance of only four miles.&nbsp; The hike requires three significant vertical drops, each about 1200 ft., before reaching the Colorado River.&nbsp; Food and water must be carried and cached on the way down, so that you can safely make the hike back out (there is no water above Thunder River).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our journey began at 4:00 in the morning so that we could reach Monument Point at dawn, just before making the first descent to a flat expanse of slickrock called The Esplanade.&nbsp; My pack was exceedingly heavy with necessary supplies, which made climbing down the steep canyon wall difficult and hazardous. But the panoramic views of the Grand Canyon were spectacular. The next major descent was from the edge of The Esplanade down into Surprise Valley. By the time we had crossed Surprise Valley and were nearing the last major descent, it was late afternoon.&nbsp; It was very hot and there was no shade or breeze to provide relief from the afternoon sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />At this point in our journey, I noticed that my friend Dave was having problems.&nbsp; A quick evaluation revealed that he was dehydrated and overheated, becoming disoriented and irrational, and in serious trouble.&nbsp; Larry and I knew that we needed to get Dave cooled down and that we needed to do it soon.&nbsp; We knew that we were near the edge of the last steep descent to the Colorado River and that the source of Thunder River was not far away.&nbsp; So, putting Dave between us, Larry and I urged and assisted him along, over the edge of Surprise Valley and down to Thunder River.&nbsp;<br /><br />The cold water of the river cooled the surrounding air significantly and the trees growing along its banks provided much needed shade.&nbsp; We decided to make our camp here, rather than continuing on to the main campground further down the canyon.&nbsp; We spent most of the next two days near the Thunder River and Dave was able to recuperate before we made the hike back out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />In talking to Dave, I learned that he had gotten into physical trouble because of some choices he had made, both in his preparation and during the hike.&nbsp; The basic problem was two-fold:&nbsp; he wasn't drinking enough fluids and the fluid he was drinking did not contain the necessary salts and electrolytes needed to replace those being lost through perspiration.&nbsp; Although we had all been instructed and warned on this issue ahead of time, he had not followed those instructions, thinking instead that he could get by doing it his own way; a decision that resulted in very serious consequences.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I have pondered about my experience hiking the Thunder River Trail, I have come to realize that there are a number of similarities to our mortal experience, and I would like to share five things I learned from this experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Life is a journey, full of different pathways, and each of us is walking a path of our own choosing.&nbsp;<br /></strong>Our journey actually began long before we were born, while we lived with our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; There we were prepared for mortality and we each chose to come to Earth in the hope of becoming like Him.&nbsp; And our journey does not end when this mortal experience has come to a close.&nbsp; Our time on this Earth is but a brief moment in our eternal existence, much like my time on the Thunder River trail was but a relatively small moment in my life.&nbsp; However, the significance of our time on Earth to our final destination cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>The choices we make here and the path we chose to follow&nbsp;<em>now</em>&nbsp;will determine where we end up after our experience on Earth has concluded.&nbsp; God's desire, purpose, and very existence are centered on helping us return to Him and become partakers of Eternal Life.&nbsp; Each of you has been blessed to come to Earth at this time when the fullness of the Gospel has been restored to Earth, and have chosen to be part of the Lord's Church and Kingdom.&nbsp; Your time here on Earth is not accidental or random, but rather you are here at this time so that you may do the most good in building the Kingdom of God and furthering your own eternal progression.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Of all the trails we may choose to follow in this life, the Gospel Path is the only one that will lead us back to our Father.&nbsp; It is good to stop from time to time and ask ourselves, is that the path that I am currently on? Am I smack-dab-right-in-the-center of the Gospel Path? Or am I straying to the edge of the path, or have I made choices that are leading me off the path? Am I fully embracing His Gospel and teachings, or have I become involved in anything that will take me away from Him?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In his vision of the Tree of Life, Lehi saw and described the Gospel Path. "[I] beheld a strait and narrow path....And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were pressing forward, that they might obtain the path." (1 Ne 8: 20-21)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Nephi observed that "...[God's] paths are righteous.&nbsp; Behold, the way for man is narrow, but lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel." (2 Ne 9: 41)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma counseled to "walk in [God's] paths, which are straight." (Alma 7: 9)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />And the Savior said, "...strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." (Matt. 7: 14; 3 Ne 14: 14)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In these verses the Gospel path is described as being both "strait" (s-t-r-a-i-t) and "straight" (s-t-r-a-i-g-h-t).&nbsp; The words mean different things. The word strait (s-t-r-a-i-t) is a synonym of narrow and is often used to describe a passageway or channel that is bounded or limited in its width, so that individuals or vessels traversing such a passage often must do so single-file.&nbsp; There were places on the Thunder River trail that were very narrow or strait, and required that we walk it carefully.&nbsp; One misstep or the loss of balance, in places, could have resulted in serious injury&nbsp;<br /><br />Another meaning of the word strait is strict or rigorous, and is often applied to the observance of doctrines or principles.&nbsp; Thus the Gospel Path is often called the "strait and narrow way," implying that the course we are to follow has bounds or limits that must be strictly and rigorously observed.&nbsp; The perfect example of how this is to be done was provided by the Savior, who observed all the laws and obeyed all the commandments required in mortality with exactness.&nbsp; We should strive to do the same, regardless of our imperfections.&nbsp;<br /><br />The other word used to describe the Gospel Path is straight (s-t-r-a-i-g-h-t) which can mean to follow a direct course without deviation.&nbsp; One of the more challenging portions of the Thunder River trail was crossing the Esplanade.&nbsp; This is a relatively level span of rock that extends for some distance from the base of Monument Point to the precipitous drop to Surprise Valley.&nbsp; The Esplanade posed no immediate dangers; there was no direct risk of falling or being injured.&nbsp;<br /><br />The challenge was that it all looked the same.&nbsp; The trail was clearly marked but required close attention to stay on it.&nbsp; As we were crossing the Esplanade, we suddenly realized that we were no longer on the trail.&nbsp; Somewhere we had missed the trail markers.&nbsp; Our getting off the trail had happened subtly, most likely because we were not paying attention or because we were distracted and unaware that we had stepped off the path.&nbsp; What followed was a period of intense and diligent searching to find the path again.&nbsp; Once re-found, I marveled at how easy it was to see and follow the path while I was on it, but how difficult it had been to see the correct way while wandering off the path.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So it is with the Gospel, once we have entered it through baptism, we must follow the gospel with strict obedience.&nbsp; We must give constant, daily attention to what we do.&nbsp; We must not be distracted by activities or pursuits that can cause us to step off the path.&nbsp; Deviating from the Gospel Path can have eternal consequences. Nephi warned,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And now...after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay....Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.&nbsp; Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life." (2 Nephi 31: 19-20)</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Sometimes we do get lost and end up wandering wrong or forbidden paths that take us away from God, rather than to Him.&nbsp; In the Tree of Life dream experienced by Lehi and Nephi, they both observed that many people left the path because they let go of the Iron Rod, or because they became ashamed of being on the path, and many people were so intent on seeking the things of this world that they never got on in the first place.<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The key to success in walking the Gospel Path is to listen carefully and give heed to the words of God, which is like holding onto a guardrail made of iron.&nbsp; If we never let go, we will not get lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We must also not give heed to the voices of the world that mock and ridicule those who are trying to live righteously.&nbsp; In our world today, those voices are becoming ever more loud and vicious, yet at the same time they are ever more subtle and persuasive.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, do not listen to them, ignore them, rather heed the whisperings of the Holy Spirit and the words of the prophets, which will lead and guide you in the paths of righteousness.&nbsp; I invite you to make the decision today that you will stay on the Gospel Path for the remainder of your mortal life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As you walk life's path, make good choices.<br /></strong>Sometimes we make unwise decisions that can have serious consequences.&nbsp; This is what happened to my friend Dave.&nbsp; He made choices, both in regards to his preparation for the hike and his behavior during the hike, which resulted in life-threatening repercussions.&nbsp; He had been instructed beforehand what to do, he just didn't follow those instructions and thought he knew better what he should do.&nbsp; He was trying to do it his own way.&nbsp; Had someone not been there to help him get to safety, his decisions might well have cost him his life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it is with each of us as we walk the Gospel Path.&nbsp; We sometimes do not make good choices or we simply rebel against the counsel of those who are in a position to instruct us.&nbsp; The consequences of such actions can put our eternal life in peril, unless we recognize our mistakes and repent of them.&nbsp; That is not always an easy thing but it is vital that we do it.&nbsp; Our poor choices can cause us to become disoriented or confused, and may result in our losing our way.&nbsp; This is especially true if we have let go of the Iron Rod, or the Word of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In Dave's case, had he been taking in proper fluids regularly and frequently, it is unlikely he would have suffered physically as he did.&nbsp; Likewise, if we daily feast upon the words of Christ and drink in the truths of the Gospel, it is unlikely that we will let go and wander off the path.&nbsp; But if we rationalize and tell ourselves that daily scripture study and daily prayer are not really essential, or we just don't want to be bothered, it is much more likely that we will become spiritually dehydrated.&nbsp; It is then very likely that we will become disoriented by the things of the world and wander off the Gospel Path.&nbsp;<br /><br />Is it possible to recognize if we are becoming spiritually dehydrated and disoriented? &nbsp;Yes.&nbsp; Ask yourself some probing questions, such as:&nbsp; Do I have a willing attitude to serve where called, or do I grumble about the things I am asked to do and shrink from doing anything extra?&nbsp; Am I quickly obedient to the quiet, gentle promptings of the Holy Spirit, or do I tell myself that those thoughts and feels are unimportant, silly, or just my own thoughts?&nbsp; Do I diligently abide by the rules and commandments, even if I don't fully understand them or agree with them, or do I make excuses as to why I am not doing what I should be doing?&nbsp; The BYUI Honor Code serves as an example of our willingness to obey, even though we may not understand, comprehend, or agree why it is the way it is.&nbsp; Adam was asked to offer sacrifice after leaving the Garden of Eden, which he did faithfully for many years&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;learning why he did so.&nbsp; Do you exhibit that same degree of obedience?&nbsp; Do you willingly adhere to the conditions of the Honor Code, or do you look for opportunities and excuses to shed the Honor Code and do it your way?&nbsp; Remember that in this life our Father in Heaven is testing us, to see if we will do all things He asks us to do.&nbsp; There may be times He asks us to do things we don't really understand.&nbsp; Will we be obedient?&nbsp; Will we submit to His will, or try to follow our own desires?&nbsp; The choice is ours.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In this life, everyone is packing heavy burdens.&nbsp;<br /></strong>As I started into the Grand Canyon, it was necessary to carry all the equipment, food, and water needed on the hike.&nbsp; The goal was to eliminate some of that weight along the way, thus making the journey easier.&nbsp; In our figurative journey along life's path, the loads we carry are not literal, physical weights, but rather spiritual burdens that we accumulate along the way, in the form of sinful and rebellious acts.&nbsp; The Apostle Paul said, "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). FYI I changed the word fall to come and added the reference. These burdens can spiritually weigh us down, slow down our progress, and make our journey difficult, yet we are often so hesitant to give them up, to change, or to repent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The invitation from the Savior is to give our burdens to him and to take up His burden instead.&nbsp; He has promised that "[His] burden is light" (Matt. 11:30), but what is His burden?&nbsp; A burden can refer to a load that is borne but it can also refer to a duty or labor that we perform.&nbsp; It might be more accurate to say that we take upon us the Burden of Christ as we seek to perform His duties and His labors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In describing the true followers of Christ, Alma said they are</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"...willing to bear one another's burdens... willing to mourn with those that mourn...[to] comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places...even until death."&nbsp; (Mosiah 18: 8-9)</em></p>
<p>I believe that to take up the Savior's burden is to put aside our own wants and desires, to forget about our own sufferings, and help those around us.</p>
<p>During Christ's time in mortality, he set the perfect example as to the things we should do, and the scriptures are filled with suggestions about the things we can do, such as helping the poor and needy, blessing the sick and infirm, visiting the widow and fatherless, comforting the sad and lonely, lifting the hands that hang down, teaching the gospel and bearing testimony to those seeking truth, and many other tasks.&nbsp; Taking up the Savior's burden can be as simple as fulfilling your calling in the Church, as humble as that might be, completing your visiting and home teaching faithfully each month, and attending the temple regularly.&nbsp; Certainly that is not a comprehensive list as there are many other things we can and should do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The question we need to ask ourselves is do we do them, or do we rationalize our way out of them?&nbsp; As we perform our duties and labors, the weight of our own sorrow and guilt for sin is reduced and we find an increase in joy and peace in our life, despite any physical loads or challenges we may actually carry.&nbsp; Abraham Lincoln said, "When I do good, I feel good.&nbsp; When I don't do good, I don't feel good."&nbsp; Let's commit to doing more "good" and more fully take up the Savior's burden.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be willing to give help when you see the need and to receive help when you are in need.<br /></strong>Sometimes overcoming the consequences of wrong choices requires the help of others.&nbsp; The problem most of us have is that we want to do it our way, without involving anyone else, and many of us don't recognize that we need help in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Dave's case, he was largely unaware that he was in physical danger, but Larry and I both recognized the warning signs and worked together to get Dave out of that situation.&nbsp; To us, at that moment, it was unimportant how Dave got into that situation; the important thing was how to get him out of it.&nbsp; When we make bad choices, sometimes it is necessary, as part of the repentance process, to visit with our priesthood leaders and seek their help in getting us back on the correct path.&nbsp; They will give us guidance and counsel, and may even require specific actions on our part.&nbsp; If your repentance is to be successful, you must heed their advice and counsel.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you are struggling under the burden of sinful acts, the weight of transgression, the slavery of addictive behaviors, or the sting of hurt feelings, I plead with you to visit with your Bishop.&nbsp; Seek the help of those whom the Savior has placed along the way to assist you.&nbsp; This can be a very difficult step but it is essential.&nbsp; The recovery period might seem long, but if you follow the advice of your Bishop and do the things he asks you to do, you will find yourself more squarely on the Gospel Path.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition, when we see others who are making poor choices, or who are wandering from the Gospel Path, we can reach out the hand of fellowship, in love and compassion, to help them and encourage them to make good choices and to return to the strait and narrow path that leads to eternal life.&nbsp; Remember that "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way..." (Isaiah 53: 6) and each one of us needs the power of the atonement to return to the correct way and the right path.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Find joy in your journey and strive to be happy.&nbsp;<br /></strong>Here we are together on this Earth, and it is unlikely any of us will get out of here alive, so try to develop a positive outlook.&nbsp; Practice looking for the beauty and goodness that are around you.&nbsp; Before I started on my hike into the Grand Canyon, I knew it would be difficult and hot and dusty and tiring and long; I knew there would be dangers and possible hazards, but I also knew that it would be rewarding and beautiful, and ultimately satisfying to have completed something so arduous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not believe that we have been placed on Earth to merely endure our time here.&nbsp; The great Creator of this world beautified it so that it might bring joy and happiness to our mortal experience.&nbsp; Take time to enjoy the special moments, the grand vistas, and the subtle beauty of mortality. Take time to pause and smell the flowers (and as a botanist, I mean that literally). Life is all too fleeting (you may not feel that now, but you will) and if all we ever focus on is the negative or the problems we experience, or the difficulties we are having, we will have missed out on one of the most beautiful aspects of God's love for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In summary, the five lessons I learned from hiking the Thunder River trail are:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life is a journey, and we must follow the Gospel Path without deviation if we are to return to our Heavenly Father.<br />2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make good choices each day, so we don't become disoriented and lost.<br />3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must give up our burdens and take up the Burden of Christ<br />4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be willing to get help from those who can assist us the most, and be willing to give assistance to those who need our help.<br />5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find joy in the journey and recognize God's love for us.<br />&nbsp;<br />As I prepared for this talk today, I was impressed by the spirit to share with you another experience.&nbsp; It is a very sacred experience to me, one that I have never shared publicly and rarely in private, but I have felt the prompting of the Holy Spirit that I should relate it to you.&nbsp; The experience came in the form of a dream.&nbsp; Let me preface this by saying that it is very unusual for me to remember dreams, but this particular dream was so impressed upon my mind, that the details of it have permanently remained with me.&nbsp;<br /><br />In my dream, I found myself in a dark void.&nbsp; I do not know the size of the space but my perception was that it was immense, seemingly without boundaries.&nbsp; In the distance, I noticed a narrow, vertical conduit of light, stretching out of sight in both directions.&nbsp; As I approached this conduit I found it to be filled with people, dressed in white robes, and moving upwards or downwards.&nbsp; Some were drifting, moving very slowly, and seemingly oblivious to where they were or what was going on.&nbsp; Others were moving more quickly, and a few were progressing quite rapidly upward.&nbsp; These last ones seemed very intent on what they were doing and the direction they were headed.&nbsp; In my observations, I noticed that no one was stationary.&nbsp; All were in some state of motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The scene then changed and I saw that this conduit of light extended upward to an immense and glorious mansion.&nbsp; It was of a golden hue and radiated light.&nbsp; I observed that it was composed of different parts or sections.&nbsp; At its core was a small section that shone with a brightness far beyond any of the other parts of the building.&nbsp; Entrance into that small, central portion of the mansion was through a single doorway that was watched over by a guardian.&nbsp; As I approached that doorway, the guardian instructed me that this was the abode of the Eternal God and of his Son, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; It became apparent to me that the conduit of light I observed represented the pathway to eternal life and that the purpose and objective of that pathway was to provide access to where our Father in Heaven lives.&nbsp; I then realized that entering into His presence is fully dependent on our choices in this life, that it is through our actions and desires that we choose, and that relatively few would make the choices necessary to qualify them to live in the presence of the Father and the Son.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In this life, we cannot ignore the commandments of God or follow forbidden pathways and then expect to be admitted into the abode of God and live with him.&nbsp; We cannot sneak into heaven, hoping that our poor choices and sinful acts will somehow be dismissed without having done all we can in this life to repent of them.&nbsp; Our progression towards eternal life depends on the daily attention we give to achieving that goal.&nbsp; In the pathway that leads to Eternal Life, some are merely drifting, not really paying much attention to the details of their progression.&nbsp; Others are making moderate progress but could be doing better.&nbsp; Still others are progressing rapidly by diligently seeking to incorporate gospel principles into their lives and being totally submissive to the Father's will.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />As you review your life, how would you evaluate your progress?&nbsp; Is it upward or downward?&nbsp; Is it fast or slow?&nbsp; Sometimes it can be difficult to measure our progress, but may I suggest that if you are honestly seeking to do the things you should be doing, and are willing to shun the world and live by the truths the Father has revealed through his prophets, that you&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;making good progress.&nbsp; Your challenge is to keep living in this manner, daily seeking to do what is right, and submit to the will of the Father until He sees fit to call you home.&nbsp; That might be for a very long time.&nbsp; Are you up for the challenge?&nbsp; I have confidence that you can do it, and offer you my encouragement to keep moving forward, to remember who you are, and to make good choices.&nbsp; As you go forth from this place, you do not know and cannot see what lies ahead of you, but your Father in Heaven knows.&nbsp; Always have a willing heart; always be submissive to the Spirit; always seek to do the Lord's will and you will be blessed and guided in your efforts.&nbsp;<br /><br />I conclude by returning to our opening hymn, "Hope of Israel," and reading the last verse:</p>
<p><em>Soon the battle will be over;<br /></em><em>Ev'ry foe of truth be down.<br /></em><em>Onward, onward, youth of Zion;<br /></em><em>Thy reward the victor's crown.<br /></em><em>Hope of Israel, rise in might<br /></em><em>With the sword of truth and right;<br /></em><em>Sound the warcry, "Watch and pray!"<br /></em><em>Vanquish ev'ry foe today. (Hymns, no. 259)</em></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I express unto you the love I feel for each of you and commend you for the righteous choices you have and continue to make.&nbsp; You are the Hope of Israel, Zion's Army, Children of the Promised Day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I leave you with my witness of the Living Savior.&nbsp; I know that he is.&nbsp; I know that this is His gospel, His church, and His kingdom.&nbsp; Of these things I testify, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Elder Johnson, President Clark, Members of the Faculty, Staff, friends and families of graduates, and graduates.&nbsp; I am happy to share this very momentous day with you.&nbsp; You graduates have successfully completed your coursework, examinations, and other requirements to qualify you to graduate from this great institution.&nbsp; That is an impressive achievement, and you deserve much credit and recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The First Presidency and the Twelve would wish me to extend to you their love, their appreciation, and their warmest congratulations as well.&nbsp; What a marvelous blessing is the Church Educational System, which maintains this and other institutions of learning, where truths both secular and religious can be studied in an atmosphere of faith, and where virtuous living and high standards are expected of those who both teach and attend.&nbsp; I hope you appreciate that unique and wonderful combination made possible by the Church for your eternal benefit.&nbsp; As you grow older and look back upon your years here, your appreciation will deepen and your gratitude to the Lord will increase as you contemplate the uniqueness of your education here at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that many of you are faced with uncertainty. &nbsp;&nbsp;Most of you hope to find employment in what is a very difficult job market.&nbsp; Others of you will go on to pursue other degrees at this or other institutions.&nbsp; Still others will settle in to building a home life and raising children.&nbsp; In every case, you will be better off for having completed your degree here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have decided to talk to you about these times, which are difficult both economically and morally, and how you might approach them, and to give you hope that things will work out for you if you plan and pray and work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have broken my advice into four topics:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love these words and the thoughts they contain, said to be written on an inscription in a tablet in an old Yorkshire church:&nbsp; &ldquo;In the year 1652 when through England all things sacred were either profaned or neglected, this church was built by Sir Robert Shirley, . . . whose special praise it is to have done the best of things in the worst of times and to have hoped them in the most calamitous.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup>&nbsp; That is a great tribute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Times <em>are</em> tough, but you can still do the best of things.&nbsp; Times have been much worse than they are now.&nbsp; When my father graduated from the University of Utah, the Great Depression was in full swing.&nbsp; He was entering a world where there was 25% unemployment.&nbsp; Today, it is about one-third of that.&nbsp; Let me give you some idea, in his own words, of what the Great Depression was for him.&nbsp; We found among his things carbon copies of letters he had written his father and brother, and their letters in return.&nbsp; The year was 1936.&nbsp; He had just returned from his mission.&nbsp; His father was serving as the President of Northern States Mission, headquartered in Chicago.&nbsp; Dad was in charge of the family farm, the home, and was trying to make ends meet with a salary of $65 per month working for the Church while supplementing this income with another $35 per month from teaching seminary.&nbsp; Elder Johnson, I trust as Church Commissioner of Education that you are a little more generous with our seminary teachers today!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I quote from a letter to his brother, who was working in Montana as a mining engineer: The mortgage payment on the farm of $64.88 was due .&nbsp; &ldquo;Frankly, I am broke.&nbsp; I have had to pay gas and light and water bills, have had to buy coal, &hellip;&nbsp; And now staring me in the face is the problem of getting money to cover the taxes on the car &ndash; about $17, license &ndash; $5, and insurance&hellip;&nbsp; This with having to buy dinner every day and the food for breakfast and supper, together with incidental expenses including carfare and gas and oil and grease has thrown me almost on my back.&nbsp; I have been walking and riding the streetcar of late, but this practically means three tokens a day &ndash; and then I have to have the car to go to the farm occasionally, besides sundry things.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m walking in circles.&nbsp; [In addition to pressures at work] I have that difficult seminary class, my Sunday School responsibilities, my British Mission committee work, the responsibility of the house and farm, and a girl (who later became his wife and my mother).&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you, my head hums.&nbsp; All of which leads up to this situation.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how I can meet [the farm mortgage].&nbsp; I still have $27 to pay on that typewriter [at the office].</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggest that you send to me what money you can spare&hellip;. Then I shall write Father.&nbsp; He is so busy he cannot think of these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote this talk on a nice laptop furnished by the Church.&nbsp; He produced his work on a typewriter that he was paying off in installments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have no such trials today.&nbsp; There is no reason for pessimism; there is every reason for hope and optimism.&nbsp; Remember, in a country of 10% unemployment, there is 90% employment.&nbsp; Most indicators point to economic recovery and job creation.&nbsp; What values will you take away from today&rsquo;s recession?&nbsp; Just determine to make the best of every circumstance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be optimistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samuel Johnson, the eighteenth century literary critic considered by many to be the most distinguished man in the history of English letters, once reflected on &ldquo;&hellip;the thoughtlessness with which [man] floats along the stream of time&hellip;&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider for a moment that image in your minds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There simply is no substitute for goals, planning, and steady, focused, directed application; that is, work.&nbsp; Those who live productive lives work hard.&nbsp; I am satisfied that is the case.&nbsp; They discipline themselves.&nbsp; And success doesn&rsquo;t come overnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In her wonderfully written book, <em>West with the Night</em>, Beryl Markham makes the following insightful statement:&nbsp; &ldquo;If a man has any greatness in him, it comes to light, not in one flamboyant hour, but in the ledger of his daily work.&rdquo; <sup>3</sup> &nbsp;It is the day in and day out application of work as well as thought, prayer, and study that leads to achievement and to a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life has taught me that working through a problem, completing a task, grinding through a mound of paperwork, even repairing a broken appliance or lawn mower, can bring me much more satisfaction than going to a movie or watching a television show.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apply yourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Douglas Southall Freeman, in his highly acclaimed biography of Robert E. Lee, closed his work with this story.&nbsp; I quote, &ldquo;[An] incident occurred in Northern Virginia, probably on his last visit there.&nbsp; A young mother brought her baby to him to be blessed.&nbsp; He took the infant in his arms and looked at it and then at her and slowly said, &lsquo;Teach him he must deny himself.&rsquo;&rdquo; <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, he got that thought from the words of the Savior Himself, as recorded in the sixteenth chapter of Matthew: &ldquo;Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.&rdquo; <sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One practical application of that principle is this:&nbsp; Now probably is not the time in your lives to be buying the fanciest iPad, the biggest truck, or the most expensive flat-screen television.&nbsp; Those can come later, when you are on a secure financial footing, and they should never be facilitated by high-interest consumer debt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am convinced that the best way to begin cultivating a proper attitude toward spending is to pay your tithing.&nbsp; The Lord has promised that He will open the windows of heaven to those who observe this great commandment. <sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In a conference address given thirty one years ago, then Elder Gordon B. Hinckley said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So many of us are so much like [Peter on the occasion when he denied the Lord]. We pledge our loyalty; we affirm our determination to be of good courage; we declare, sometimes even publicly, that come what may we will do the right thing, that we will stand for the right cause, that we will be true to ourselves and to others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the pressures begin to build. Sometimes these are social pressures. Sometimes they are personal appetites. Sometimes they are false ambitions. There is a weakening of the will. There is a softening of discipline. There is capitulation. And then there is remorse, self-accusation, and bitter tears of regret.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the great tragedies we witness almost daily,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is the tragedy of men of high aim and low achievement. Their motives are noble. Their proclaimed ambition is praiseworthy. Their capacity is great. But their discipline is weak. They succumb to indolence. Appetite robs them of will.&rdquo; <sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Dear graduates, any worthwhile dream is worth the work <em>and</em> the wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deny yourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will illustrate this principle with what I learned from an experience I had in my youth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My teenage years took place during the 1950's, the years of neon signs, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and when the hottest car you could own was a Studebaker Golden Hawk, and when my family drove a Plymouth Cranbrook, a flathead 6 with all the power of today's riding lawn mowers. I had all of the zero to 60 times memorized then. A Studebaker Golden Hawk reached 60 in under 8 seconds; our Plymouth Cranbrook in just under two minutes, downhill on a warm day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four or five times during the decade of the 50's, our family drove to California for our summer vacation. Most of the time, we drove to Los Angeles on old Highway 91, long before freeways or automobile air conditioners. I have vivid recollections of Baker and Barstow, California, where it could be 100 degrees at 10 o'clock at night, and where the 5 of us children and our parents, packed in our little 4-door Plymouth, would tumble out and gas up and splash cool water on our faces. We carried a canvas water bag hooked over the license plate bracket on the car, so that the movement of air over it kept its contents tolerably cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On at least one of these occasions, we drove to San Francisco instead. On that trip, after crossing the seemingly endless expanse of Nevada, we finally began to climb the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains west of Reno on the old 2-lane highway. As we snaked up the winding road toward Donner's Pass, my father stopped the car and had us all climb out. He wanted to show us the sight of the old Donner-Reed campsite and to tell us their story. To this day, that memory is etched deeply in my mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the cool air beneath the massive conifers, beside a beautiful blue mountain lake, we walked over the ground where, just over a 100 years earlier, the 87 men, women and children of the Donner Party had met with cruel fate.&nbsp; It is a terrible saga; a tale of suffering, starvation, freezing and death, all brought about by poor judgment, strife and delay, and by their unwitting willingness to risk taking an unknown route THOUGHT TO BE A SHORTCUT in the hope of getting to California a few days sooner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Wallace Stegner said, &ldquo;The American Dream has some nightmares attached to it,&rdquo; <sup>8</sup> and this certainly is one of them.&nbsp; Briefly told, the story goes like this: In the Spring of 1846, George and Jacob Donner formed a wagon train to go west to California.&nbsp; With the Donners were James Frasier Reed and his family and a few others who desired to immigrate to California. They departed Independence, Missouri on the 12th of May, 1846. The trail to California in those days did not go through the Salt Lake Valley, but swept to the north and west, thus avoiding the Wasatch Mountains and the Great Salt Desert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a young man by the name of Lansford W. Hastings, a 27-year old attorney, who had moved to California, and who was eager to make a name for himself, urged all the emigrant trains that year to cut down from Fort Bridger through the uninhabited valley of the Great Salt Lake and across the Salt Desert, a route he had never seen himself except on crude maps.&nbsp; Hastings promised a savings of several hundred miles and many days of travel.&nbsp; Twenty wagons, including those of the Donners and Reeds, decided to take Hasting's Cutoff. &nbsp;All the other hundreds of wagons on the trail kept to the known route. &nbsp;Even after being warned off by experienced travelers who had crossed it on horseback, the Donners and Reeds decided to chance it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything went wrong. Instead of taking one week to travel from Ft. Bridger to the Great Salt Lake, as Hastings had promised, it took a month. They bushwhacked their way down what was later known as Emigration Canyon, a route our own Mormon Pioneers followed just one year later.&nbsp; Precious time was lost. As they struck out across the Great Salt Desert, their wagons bogged down, breaking through the salty crust and becoming mired up to the axels in the bog below. Instead of the two days Hastings had said it would take to cross the desert, it took six. They ran out of water, and their food supplies were dwindling.&nbsp; Over 600 miles lay ahead of them. &nbsp;Oxen and cattle, crazed with thirst, bolted and ran off, never to be seen again. Tempers flared, and heated arguments and fights broke out.&nbsp; One man killed another when their wagons became entangled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More precious days were lost. They finally came to the spot where Hasting's Cutoff joined the regular trail.&nbsp; Instead of saving time and distance, it had been 125 miles farther and had taken weeks longer.&nbsp; Those hundreds of wagons, which had stayed on the tested trail, were well ahead of them now, safely on their way across the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was turning cold, and food supplies were dangerously low. There was no place to stop for the winter, no outposts, no towns, no military forts. They worried that they would not get through the mountains before snow fell. They were right. However, a group on horseback travelling east from California gave them encouraging news: The mountain pass was clear and was expected to remain clear for another month. They camped and rested themselves and their cattle, and in so doing, lost another 5 precious days. They finally moved out, and were within 1,000 feet of the summit, when it started to snow with such fury that they were forced to strike camp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happened over the next terrible weeks and months is permanently etched into the American historical landscape.&nbsp; It snowed and snowed and snowed, and repeated attempts to reach the summit failed.&nbsp; Here by the lake, then known as Truckee Lake, now Donner Lake, they set up a makeshift camp, and for the next 5 months struggled to survive.&nbsp; I will not recount the grizzly details of their suffering, but suffice it to say, when heroic rescue parties reached them in the Spring of 1847, 22 men, 14 children, and 5 women had perished from hunger and cold.&nbsp; Some of the survivors had gone mad. &nbsp;All of them were walking skeletons.&nbsp; Their story became front-page news all over the country, and has reached nearly mythical proportions in our own day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is my purpose in recounting this terrible tragedy?&nbsp; It is that it was so unnecessary.&nbsp; It was so avoidable. &nbsp;It is that, because a few people were seduced by misguided voices, in hopes of taking a shortcut, of making life a little easier, innocent people paid a terrible price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some time after reaching California, Virginia Reed wrote a letter to her cousin in the East, who was contemplating emigrating to California.&nbsp; In part, the letter read as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<em>Oh, Mary. I have not wrote you half of the trouble we&rsquo;ve had, but I have wrote you enough to let you know what trouble is. But thank God, we are the only family that did not eat human flesh. We have left everything, but I don&rsquo;t care for that. We have got through with our lives. Don&rsquo;t let this letter dishearten anybody. Remember, never take no cutoffs and hurry along as fast as you can."</em> <sup>9</sup><em> </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the grammar of that letter may offend the ear, it nevertheless contains a powerful and eloquent lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Striking out on an untested trail, against the advice of those who knew better, with the hope of saving a few miles, or a few days, had caused unimaginable suffering.&nbsp; In attempting to explain what made them do it, historian Donald Buck said, "It [seems] always our insatiable desire to take the shortcut in life, thinking it will get us there faster, and invariably it doesn't." <sup>10</sup>&nbsp; In the case of the 87 people of the Donner Party, nearly half of them suffered a terrible death, and those who survived carried deep emotional and physical scars with them to their graves. <sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The great lesson in this tragedy is this: Stay on the beaten path; hold firm to the tested and true; don't stray off into dangerous territory against the warning voices of the prophets, your parents, and your true friends. Don't seek shortcuts in life that may be dead ends that sap your strength, that weaken your resolve, that rob you of precious years, and that subject you to the powers of destruction.&nbsp; There really are no shortcuts in life worth taking.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t live life by CliffsNotes<sup>â</sup>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, it is that there are countless Lansford Hastings in society today, trying to lure you off the tested path, promising shortcuts to success and happiness. The Lord and the prophets plead with us to take the tested path to happiness, and promises that if we do so, we will not bog down in the salt flats of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today's Lansford Hastings take subtle forms: They may be in the form of appealing media, which portray casual, fast-developing relationships between men and women and sell it as joy and happiness. The tested route to morality, the one taught by the Lord and His prophets that keeps us ahead of the snowstorms, is through abstinence before marriage and total fidelity in marriage. Which would you rather have, the short thrill that may come by shortcutting the law of chastity, followed by the cold dark agony associated with sin, or the warm sunshine associated with keeping the commandments?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Lansford Hastings would have us believe there are shortcuts to financial security and fiscal responsibility, both in private life and in the public domain. They would have us believe that get rich quick schemes can replace the tried and tested ways of hard work, industry, careful budgeting, and discipline.&nbsp; They would have us believe that the payment of our tithes and offerings is just too hard, that the Church can get along without them for a season, and that we can always begin to live this law when we are earning just a little more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there are a thousand other Lansford Hastings working on our minds and hearts to find the easy way, the pleasurable way, to success and happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there are no shortcuts, my dear young friends, in life's most important matters. &nbsp;There are, of course, always better and smarter ways of doing things.&nbsp; Machinery, technology, and modern methods have made tremendous improvements in the human condition.&nbsp; But things that pertain to our <em>real</em> success and personal development, our <em>real happiness, </em>and our <em>real</em> progress along the path to the Celestial Kingdom, still require commitment, effort, and self-discipline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the words of Mary Reed: <em>"Remember, don't take no cutoffs, and hurry along as fast as you can."</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so my counsel to you this day is: &nbsp;<em>Be optimistic. &nbsp;Apply yourselves.&nbsp; Deny yourselves.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t take shortcuts.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May God bless you as you now &ldquo;commence&rdquo; a new and exciting life.&nbsp; May you stay close to the Church, for it is your best friend.&nbsp; May you determine to live the Gospel and remain true to your covenants.&nbsp; May you live happy and productive lives.&nbsp; And may it be said of you one day, as it was of Sir Robert Shirley, that you did the &ldquo;best of things in the worst of times and hoped them in the most calamitous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I share my testimony with you of the divinity of this work; of the living reality of God, our Eternal Father, and his living Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and I wish you God&rsquo;s choicest blessings for your lives.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be with you on another great day at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us today, that our faith might increase, that our love for God and for each other might grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been a little over five years since Sister Clark and I set foot on this campus for the first time.&nbsp; This has been a marvelous time in our lives.&nbsp; The Lord has blessed us with great experiences.&nbsp; We love this university, we love you, and we love your children and your grandchildren.&nbsp; I treasure our associations and the sweet gifts of the Spirit I have felt in your midst.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to talk today about a pattern in our lives that plays a central role in building the kingdom and establishing Zion. &nbsp;Over the past two years we have heard this pattern in the words of the living prophet.&nbsp; President Monson has called us to reach out to our brothers and sisters who are less active, or struggling, or spiritually wounded, or not yet part of the kingdom and say to them:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Come back.&nbsp; We reach out to you in the pure love of Christ and express our desire to assist you and to welcome you into full fellowship.&nbsp; To those who are wounded in spirit or who are struggling and fearful, we say, Let us lift you and cheer you and calm your fears.&rdquo;&nbsp; <sup>1</sup></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a call to action.&nbsp; It is a call to act in faith to love&mdash;to love our brothers and sisters and to love the Lord&mdash;even when love is hard.&nbsp; The pattern I want to talk about today, the pattern we so clearly need to fulfill the call of the prophet, is love by faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me share with you a modern parable about love by faith.&nbsp; As I tell the story, please listen for the lessons of the parable about acting in faith, about the Savior, and about His pure and perfect love.&nbsp; This is a parable based on a true story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There once was a good sister who received a call from her bishop to serve in the nursery.&nbsp; The good sister was concerned about the call.&nbsp; She had many children, and she enjoyed serving in the Relief Society presidency in her ward.&nbsp; The good sister was not looking forward to serving in the nursery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although she wondered what in the world the bishop had in mind, she accepted the call.&nbsp; In fact, she decided to make the nursery a showcase.&nbsp; She had studied child development in college, and she had files of materials and many ideas for activities and crafts the children could make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the good sister&rsquo;s first Sunday, it seemed like every single child fussed and cried.&nbsp; Nothing she tried worked very well.&nbsp; The children were ornery and upset.&nbsp; That first Sunday established a pattern for the next few weeks:&nbsp; she would prepare what she thought was a great plan; the children would fuss and cry; the good sister would get frustrated and upset; and then she would go home and cry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After many weeks, the good sister was discouraged.&nbsp; Nursery was a burden.&nbsp; She dreaded facing the little children each week.&nbsp; She said to herself:&nbsp; &ldquo;I have done my best, but nothing has worked.&nbsp; What more can I do?&rdquo;&nbsp; She decided to pray to Heavenly Father about the nursery and about her frustration.&nbsp; She told Him of her hopes and her disappointment.&nbsp; She asked Him for His help and guidance.&nbsp; Heavenly Father answered her prayer.&nbsp; This is the message she received:&nbsp; the lesson plans are mostly about you; focus instead on the children; learn to know them and love them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a good message, but hard to hear.&nbsp; The good sister had to repent.&nbsp; She had to change her attitude and her behavior.&nbsp; She prayed some more and went to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next Sunday she went to nursery with a very simple plan.&nbsp; She met the children at the door and greeted them by name.&nbsp; She talked to them about their families, their favorite food, and much else.&nbsp; She brought a snack and had singing time.&nbsp; She read them stories and helped them find toys.&nbsp; Some of the children were still ornery, and some fussed; but there was a different feeling in the nursery that week.&nbsp; And when it was over, the good sister did not cry when she got home.&nbsp; She was exhausted, but not tearful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Little by little as the good sister got to know the children better, her feelings about them changed.&nbsp; She looked forward to Sundays.&nbsp; She was excited and happy to be with her nursery kids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, inspiration came.&nbsp; One week she took a camera to nursery and took each child&rsquo;s picture.&nbsp; She prepared a picture board, mounted each child&rsquo;s picture on the board, and took the board to nursery every week.&nbsp; The board was a big hit.&nbsp; The children loved seeing themselves on the board.&nbsp; They not only felt important, they felt loved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good sister found many ways to teach the children gospel principles.&nbsp; They sang songs and learned about Heavenly Father and His love for them.&nbsp; She taught them about Jesus and shared with the children her love of the Lord.&nbsp; She invited them to be good and to help each other so that everyone could be happy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a lot of love in that nursery.&nbsp; The children loved it so much they would run to nursery after sacrament meeting.&nbsp; They would seek out the good sister before sacrament meeting to say hi to her.&nbsp; They would often visit the good sister at home to bring her a flower or a note.&nbsp; The children loved being in the nursery, and the good sister loved them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She came to see them and love them as the Savior loves them.&nbsp; She loved those children with the pure love of Christ.&nbsp; She loved them so much that when the bishop came to her after she had served for a year and proposed that she be released, the good sister pleaded with him to let her stay.&nbsp; She served in the nursery for three wonderful years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There is much to learn in this parable about love by faith and much we can apply to President Monson&rsquo;s call to reach out and rescue those who have wandered, who are struggling, who are spiritually wounded, or who don&rsquo;t know the way home.&nbsp; Those who need you may be your own children.&nbsp; They may be your neighbors.&nbsp; They may be in your ward.&nbsp; They may be people at your work.&nbsp; They may be people you do not know well.&nbsp; Whoever they are, the Lord will put them in your path if you are prepared to act in faith to help them and to love them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord placed small children who needed love and good teaching in the path of the good sister.&nbsp; She learned from her experience in the nursery three powerful lessons about love by faith:&nbsp; 1) like faith, love is a principle of action; 2) the pure love of Christ is a gift bestowed on His true followers; and 3) the love of Christ is like divine light; it comes little by little, but it comes with great power. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we act in faith to put these lessons into practice, the Lord will bless us with His love as we reach out to lost and wandering souls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first lesson the good sister learned is that like faith, love is a principle of action.&nbsp; Love is not only something we feel, love is something we do.&nbsp; When we love by faith, our faith and hope in the Savior moves us to the actions and words of love&mdash;a visit, an invitation, a word of testimony, a helping hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acting in faith and love to rescue a lost soul may not come easily.&nbsp; Remember, the shepherd had to go into the wilderness to find the lost sheep.&nbsp; The people who need rescuing may be very different from us and their circumstances may seem to us, and probably to them, like a wilderness.&nbsp; Sometimes we hesitate or miss an opportunity because of fear of rejection or failure, a worry about awkwardness, or the burden we might have to carry.&nbsp; That is why extending the hand of fellowship to rescue is always an act of faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar has given us a framework for understanding faith as a principle of action and power:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Faith in Christ is inextricably tied to and results in hope in Christ for our redemption and exaltation.&nbsp; And assurance and hope make it possible for us to walk to the edge of the light and take a few steps into the darkness&mdash;expecting and trusting the light to move and illuminate the way (see Boyd K. Packer, &ldquo;<a href="http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1983.htm/ensign%20january%201983%20.htm/the%20candle%20of%20the%20lord.htm" target="_blank">The Candle of the Lord,</a>&rdquo; Ensign, Jan. 1983, 54).&nbsp; The combination of assurance and hope initiates action in the present.&rdquo;<strong><sup>2</sup></strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>When we act in faith to visit a less-active member or invite a neighbor to come to Church, we act with assurance of and hope for help from Heaven.&nbsp; Indeed, our actions invite the Holy Ghost to help us love as Christ loves.&nbsp; As Elder Russell M. Nelson has taught, such love is possible, but only on conditions of faith and obedience:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Jesus asked us to love one another as He has loved us.&nbsp; Is that possible? Can our love for others really approach divine love?&nbsp; Yes it can!&nbsp; The pure love of Christ is granted to all who seek and qualify for it.&nbsp; Such love includes service and requires obedience.&rdquo;<strong><sup>3</sup></strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the second lesson the good sister learned: &ldquo;the pure love of Christ is a gift; as Mormon taught, it is bestowed on the true followers of Christ.&rdquo; <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good sister learned that she had to repent before she could obtain heavenly power to love with the pure love of Christ.&nbsp; The love she sought began to come as the Atonement of the Savior began to change her heart.&nbsp; She did not wait to act until she was filled with Christ&rsquo;s pure and perfect love for the children.&nbsp; She acted in faith to pray, to repent, and to move forward on the new path; and the Lord blessed her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks has taught that revelation &ldquo;comes most often when we are on the move.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup> I believe that the same is true of love.&nbsp; Love comes most often when we are on the move.&nbsp; If the good sister in this parable had waited to serve the nursery children until her heart was full of love for them, she would never have served or developed that love.&nbsp; She trusted in the Savior and began to move, and the love followed.&nbsp; She came to love by faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gifts of the Spirit come after we act in faith.&nbsp; We must not wait passively for the gift of Christ&rsquo;s love to come.&nbsp; In fact, if we wait, it will not come.&nbsp; That is because to love with the love of Christ, we must become more and more like Him.&nbsp; It is, after all, His love.&nbsp; We only receive that supernal gift if His atonement works in us to change our hearts through repentance and sustained righteous action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, as Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught us, charity, or the pure love of Christ, is something we become:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The reason charity never fails and the reason charity is greater than even the most significant acts of goodness he cited is that charity, &ldquo;the pure love of Christ&rdquo; (Moro. 7:47), is not an </em><em>act</em><em> but a </em><em>condition</em><em> or state of being.&nbsp; Charity is attained through a succession of acts that result in a conversion.&nbsp; Charity is something one becomes."<strong><sup>6</sup></strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Pure Love of Christ is Like Divine Light</strong></p>
<p>This principle of becoming is closely related to the third lesson the good sister learned: the pure love of Christ is like divine light, and it has great power. &nbsp;That light comes to us according to our faith and obedience, but it usually does not come all at once.&nbsp; We have the promise of a fullness of light, but we receive that fullness only as the light grows within us:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To become filled with such light and love, the good sister had to change her focus.&nbsp; She came to worry less about showcasing her talents and more about serving the children.&nbsp; What John the Baptist said about the transition from his ministry to the Savior&rsquo;s can teach all of us something about focus in our service:&nbsp; &ldquo;He must increase, but I must decrease.&rdquo; <sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our concerns about ourselves decrease, our focus on the Savior increases.&nbsp; The Savior made this wonderful promise about what happens when we exercise faith in Him in a completely focused way:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.&rdquo;<strong> <sup>9</sup></strong><sup>&nbsp;</sup></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that principle applies to love as well.&nbsp; As we focus less on ourselves and act in faith to rescue those who are suffering or lost, Christ blesses us with an increasing measure of His love.&nbsp; As we become more and more like Him, that love can grow in us until we are filled with His love.&nbsp; This is the sweet promise described by the Apostle Paul in his letter to the Ephesians:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;&rdquo; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.&rdquo;<strong> <sup>10</sup></strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good sister was &ldquo;strengthened in the inner [woman]&rdquo; through the power of the Spirit.&nbsp; Through her faith and prayers she was &ldquo;rooted and grounded in love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Because she continued week in and week out to act in faith, the love of Christ grew in her and the children in her nursery could feel it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good sister saw the power of Christ&rsquo;s love:&nbsp; it was so strong that it could move a two- year-old to choose to cooperate and behave.&nbsp; I do not use this example lightly.&nbsp; I believe it is useful to see in that nursery a little microcosm of the work of rescue.&nbsp; If you had been there, especially before the good sister began to know them, you would have seen some little children who were sad and lonely.&nbsp; You would have seen some who were afraid and some who were discouraged.&nbsp; You would have seen some who acted out and some who did not want to cooperate or participate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But over time you would have seen the power of Christ&rsquo;s pure and perfect love.&nbsp; That love is the redeeming love of Christ.&nbsp; It is the love that heals, sanctifies, soothes, comforts, lifts, and strengthens.&nbsp; It is powerful.&nbsp; It healed the heart of the good sister and those little hearts in the nursery.&nbsp; It can heal the wounded souls the Lord sends us to rescue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The power of Christ&rsquo;s pure love is manifest in three very specific gifts that come to us when we apply the lessons of love by faith to rescue a struggling soul: 1) we are blessed to feel what the Savior feels for those who are struggling; 2) our words and actions are carried by the Spirit to the heart of a struggling soul so that they are just what is needed in that moment; and 3) we are blessed to see the struggling person feel the Lord&rsquo;s love for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good sister experienced these gifts in her work in the nursery.&nbsp; For just a moment I invite you to recall your own experiences in this great work of rescuing God&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; Perhaps you will remember experiences with your own children, or on a mission, or in your calling in the Primary, or in your work as a home or visiting teacher.&nbsp; Whatever the memories are, please let them run through your mind for a moment as I share with you these three gifts that come to us as we reach out in faith to love God&rsquo;s children.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>First, the Lord blesses us to see His children the way He sees them.&nbsp; He blesses us to feel about them as He feels about them.&nbsp; It may be just a glimpse, just a faint impression that comes, but this gift of divine vision and feeling creates in us empathy and understanding.&nbsp; It motivates us to action, strengthens our faith, and guides our efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, as we act in faith to reach out to His children under the guidance of the Holy Ghost, the Lord blesses us to say just what they need to hear.&nbsp; He blesses us to do what is just right for them in that moment.&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s love is perfect.&nbsp; Jesus always says the perfect thing, and He always takes the perfect action to bring people to Him.&nbsp; When we act in faith in Him to do His work, He goes with us.&nbsp; If we have &ldquo;treasure[d] up in [our] minds continually the words of life .&nbsp; .&nbsp; . ,&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp; He &ldquo;justifies all [our] words&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;and gives to us &ldquo;in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man.&rdquo; <sup>13</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I know and you know that what we actually say and actually do may feel a little awkward or not very polished.&nbsp; It may not feel very perfect to us.&nbsp; But the Savior takes our words and our actions and He carries them through His spirit unto the hearts of the people.&nbsp; He takes our sincere but imperfect effort and turns it into something that is just right, indeed, into something that is perfect.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s children must choose to act on what the Savior gives them, but we may act in confidence that He will bless what we do.</p>
<p>Third, the Lord blesses us to see Him working through us.&nbsp; We see His children feel His love in what we do and what we say.&nbsp; As we act in faith, we receive a confirming witness of the Holy Ghost that the Lord loves His children and that He loves us.&nbsp; We feel His love for us, and we feel His love growing in us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Henry B. Eyring taught the power of these gifts in words of encouragement and counsel to mission presidents about their missionaries:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The missionaries and you will feel His love as the Atonement works to change our hearts.&nbsp; Our love for Him will increase.&nbsp; We come to know the Master as we serve with Him.&nbsp; As we know Him better, we love Him even more.&nbsp; That will be true for your missionaries.&rdquo;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>&ldquo;They will grow steadily in their capacity to help all they meet feel His love for them.&nbsp; Those they speak to and teach feel the Lord&rsquo;s love for them through your missionaries.&nbsp; They will feel that love not only from what the missionaries do and say but by the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; It is the Holy Ghost that testifies of the reality of God and allows us to feel the joy of His love.&rdquo;<strong> </strong></em><sup>14</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;I saw these three gifts and the power of love by faith in the recent experience of a bishop and his wife and a less active family.&nbsp; One night the mother and father in this family had a heated argument.&nbsp; They had been struggling in their marriage, and this argument scared the mother so much that she went into the bedroom and knelt down and prayed.&nbsp; This was her third marriage and her husband&rsquo;s second.&nbsp; They had seven children between them, and she did not want to lose her marriage.&nbsp; And so she poured out her heart to Heavenly Father for help.&nbsp; It had been many years since she and her husband had been in Church.&nbsp; It had been a long time since she had prayed that hard for anything.&nbsp; But she prayed then, and she prayed hard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not far away at the very moment that sister knelt in prayer, her bishop got a very strong impression to go visit that family&mdash;right then.&nbsp; He told his wife who said, &ldquo;That is very interesting because I have just had a strong impression that I should go visit them too.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so they got right in the car and went over.&nbsp; They knocked on the door just moments after the sister had completed her prayer.&nbsp; Here was her answer:&nbsp; the Lord sent His trusted servants who heeded the promptings of the Spirit and acted in faith to love her family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bishop and his wife ministered to that family that night with the pure love of Christ.&nbsp; They felt the Savior&rsquo;s love for the family. &nbsp;They shared testimony, invited them to come back, and promised them the blessings of the Lord.&nbsp; They acted in faith to love that little family back into the warmth and light of the gospel of Christ.&nbsp; What that husband and wife heard and felt that night came from Heaven.&nbsp; It came from Christ.&nbsp; It was the pure love of Christ that touched their hearts carried there by the Holy Spirit through the words and the actions of that good bishop and his faithful wife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That family is now active in the Church, preparing to be sealed in the temple, and on their way to the happiness and joy their Heavenly Father has prepared for them through the mercy, grace, and pure love of His Beloved Son.&nbsp; And the bishop and his wife know the &ldquo;love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.&rdquo; <sup>15</sup>&nbsp;They know that God loves that family, and they know that God loves them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These supernal gifts and blessings are available to each of us as we heed the call of the prophet to love by faith and rescue God&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; It is not complicated.&nbsp; There is no complex formula to learn, no intricate steps to follow.&nbsp; It is very, very simple.&nbsp; The basic message of love by faith is this:&nbsp; be good and go.&nbsp; Be a good boy.&nbsp; Be a good girl.&nbsp; Then act in faith and go.&nbsp; Do your home and visiting teaching.&nbsp; Magnify your callings.&nbsp; Strengthen your family.&nbsp; Share the gospel with people the Lord puts in your path.&nbsp; Act on the impressions that come, and go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear witness to you brothers and sisters, that if you will follow the prophet and love by faith, if you will be good and go to the lost souls, those who wander or do not know the way home, the Lord Jesus Christ will go with you.&nbsp; He will prepare the way before you.&nbsp; His Spirit will guide you and bless you.&nbsp; And you will know the joy and the power of His redeeming love.&nbsp; I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sister Bednar and I are pleased to be with you this afternoon on the Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho campus.&nbsp; We love you, we love this place, and we especially are delighted to have this assignment in the summer rather than in the winter!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The theme for this Education Week is taken from the first verse of a well-known Latter-day Saint hymn and includes both a question and a declaration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s on the Lord&rsquo;s side?&rdquo; is a question of eternal consequence for each of us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now is the time to show&rdquo; is a declaration with immediate impact in our daily lives. (See <em>Hymns, </em>no. 260.) Today I want to examine this question and consider this declaration through the lens of lessons we can learn from Church history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zion&rsquo;s Camp expedition lead by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1834 is a striking example of choosing to be on the Lord&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; I pray for the guidance of the Holy Ghost as we briefly review the history of Zion&rsquo;s Camp and as we identify two valuable and timeless lessons from this significant episode in Church history that apply to our lives and circumstances today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith received a revelation in 1831 designating Independence, Jackson County, Missouri, as the site of Zion, the central gathering place for the Latter-day Saints and the location for the New Jerusalem identified in both the Bible and the Book of Mormon (see D&amp;C 57:1-3). &nbsp;By the summer of 1833, Mormon settlers accounted for approximately one-third of the population in Jackson County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rapidly increasing numbers, the potential political influence, and the distinctive religious beliefs of these newcomers were causes of concern to the other settlers in the area&mdash;who consequently demanded that the Church members vacate their homes and properties.&nbsp; When this ultimatum was not acted upon, the Missourians attacked the settlements and forced the Saints to leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The formation of Zion&rsquo;s camp was commanded by revelation (see D&amp;C 103).&nbsp; The primary purpose for this army of the Lord was to protect the Mormons in Jackson County from additional assaults&mdash;after the Missouri militia fulfilled its obligation to escort the settlers safely back to their homes and lands.&nbsp; The camp also was to bring money, supplies, and moral support to the destitute Saints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, during May and June of 1834, a company of over 200 Latter-day Saint volunteers led by the Prophet Joseph Smith traveled approximately 900 miles from Kirtland, Ohio, to Clay County, Missouri. Participants in Zion&rsquo;s Camp included Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Hyde, and many other readily recognizable individuals from Church history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My purpose today is not to describe the details of this demanding journey or recount all of the spiritually significant episodes that took place.&nbsp; Let me simply summarize a few major events of the Zion&rsquo;s Camp expedition:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zion&rsquo;s army was broken into smaller groups in late June of 1834, and final discharge papers were issued July 3, 1834. &nbsp;Most of the volunteers returned to Ohio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the failure to reestablish the Saints on their lands in Jackson County, Zion&rsquo;s Camp was considered by some an unsuccessful and unprofitable endeavor.&nbsp; A brother in Kirtland &mdash;one who lacked the faith to volunteer to go with the camp&mdash;met Brigham Young on his return from Missouri and asked,&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what did you gain on this useless journey to Missouri with Joseph Smith?&rsquo;&nbsp; Brother Brigham promptly replied, &lsquo;All we went for.&nbsp; I would not exchange the experience I gained in that expedition for all the wealth of Geauga county&rsquo;&mdash;the county in which Kirtland was then located.&rdquo; (in B. H. Roberts, A Comprehensive History of the Church 1:370&ndash;71)&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>I invite you to seriously think about Brigham Young&rsquo;s answer: &ldquo;All we went for.&rdquo;&nbsp; What are the key learnings we can glean from an undertaking that did not accomplish its stated purpose&mdash;but nonetheless provided for those early Saints, and can afford for us, the blessings of a lifetime?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe at least two overarching lessons are to be found in Brother Brigham&rsquo;s answer to that taunting question:&nbsp; (1) the lesson of testing, sifting, and preparing, and (2) the lesson of observing, learning from, and following the Brethren.&nbsp; I emphasize emphatically that these lessons are as important, if not more important, for us to learn and apply today than they were 176 years ago for the volunteers in Zion&rsquo;s Camp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stalwart Saints who marched in the army of the Lord were tested and tried.&nbsp; As the Lord declared,</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I have heard their prayers, and will accept their offering; and it is expedient in me that they should be brought thus far for a trial of their faith.&rdquo; (D&amp;C 105:19)</em></p>
<p>In a most literal way, the physical and spiritual challenges of Zion&rsquo;s Camp constituted a sifting of the wheat from the tares (see Matthew 13:25, 29-30; D&amp;C 101:65), a dividing of the sheep from the goats (see Matthew 25:32-33), a separating of the spiritually strong from the weak.&nbsp; Thus, each man and woman who enlisted in the army of the Lord faced and answered the penetrating question of &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s on the Lord&rsquo;s side?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Wilford Woodruff was settling his business affairs and preparing to join Zion&rsquo;s Camp, his friends and neighbors warned him not to undertake such a hazardous journey.&nbsp; They counseled, &ldquo;Do not go.&nbsp; If you do, you will lose your life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;If I knew that I should have a ball put through my heart the first step I took in the state of Missouri I would go&rdquo; (in <em>Journal of Discourses, </em>17:246).&nbsp; Wilford Woodruff knew he did not need to fear evil consequences as long as he was faithful and obedient.&nbsp; He clearly was on the Lord&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, the time to show for those faithful men and women was the summer of 1834.&nbsp; But the decision to march with the Prophet Joseph to Missouri was not necessarily a one-time, an all-inclusive, or an immediate response to the question of &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s on the Lord&rsquo;s side?&rdquo;&nbsp; The time to show arose frequently and repeatedly through mental and physical fatigue, through bloody blisters on their feet, through inadequate food and unclean water, through a multitude of disappointments, through dissensions and rebellions within the camp, and through external threats from vicious enemies.&nbsp; The time to show came in the experiences and privations of every hour, of every day, and of every week.&nbsp; It was the grand combination of the many seemingly small choices and actions in the lives of these devoted Saints that provided the conclusive answer to the question, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s on the Lord&rsquo;s side?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did the testing and sifting that occurred in the lives of the Zion&rsquo;s Camp participants serve as a preparation?&nbsp; Interestingly, nine of the brethren called into the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1835, as well as all of the Seventies called at that same time, were veterans of Zion&rsquo;s Camp.&nbsp; At a meeting following the call of the Twelve, the Prophet Joseph Smith declared:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Brethren, some of you are angry with me, because you did not fight in Missouri; but let me tell you, God did not want you to fight.&nbsp; He could not organize his kingdom with twelve men to open the gospel door to the nations of the earth, and with seventy men under their direction to follow in their tracks, unless he took them from a body of men who had offered their lives, and who had made as great a sacrifice as did Abraham. Now, the Lord has got his Twelve and his Seventy, and there will be other quorums of Seventies called.&rdquo; (quoted in Joseph Young Sr., History of the Organization of the Seventies [1878], 14)</em></p>
<p>Truly, Zion&rsquo;s Camp was a refiner&rsquo;s fire for all of the volunteers in general and for many future leaders of the Lord&rsquo;s Church in particular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experiences gained by the volunteers in the army of the Lord also were a preparation for larger, future migrations of Church members.&nbsp; More than 20 of the Zion&rsquo;s Camp participants became captains and lieutenants in two great exoduses; the first but four years in the future, involving the removal of 8,000 to 10,000 people from Missouri to Illinois (see &ldquo;From High Hopes to Despair: The Missouri Period, 1831-39,&rdquo; <em>Ensign, </em>July 2001, 44-53); and the second, twelve years in the future, the great western movement of approximately 15,000 Latter-day Saints from Illinois to the Salt Lake and other Rocky Mountain valleys.&nbsp; Viewed as a preparatory training for the larger expeditions awaiting the Latter-day Saints, Zion&rsquo;s Camp was of immense value to the Church.&nbsp; 1834 was the time to show&mdash;and to prepare for 1838 and for 1846.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As individuals and in our families, we too will be tested, sifted, and prepared, as were the members of Zion&rsquo;s Camp.&nbsp; The scriptures and the declarations of the apostles and prophets do not indicate that faithful members of this Church will have trials and tests removed from their lives.&nbsp; Rather, the scriptures and the teachings of the Brethren are replete with promises that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the making, honoring, and remembering of sacred covenants; and obedience to God&rsquo;s commandments will strengthen us to prepare for, to face, to overcome, and to learn from the trials and tests of mortality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The leaders of the Lord&rsquo;s Church clearly have identified some of the collective or generational tests we can expect to encounter in our day and generation.&nbsp; As the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1977, President Ezra Taft Benson raised a prophetic voice of warning in a meeting of regional representatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now quote extensively from President Benson&rsquo;s message and invite your focused attention on his timely counsel.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Every generation has its tests and its chance to stand and prove itself.&nbsp; Would you like to know of one of our toughest tests?&nbsp; Hear the warning words of President Brigham Young, &lsquo;The worst fear I have about this people is that they will get rich in this country, forget God and His people, wax fat, and kick themselves out of the Church and go to hell.&nbsp; This people will stand mobbing, robbing, poverty, and all manner of persecution and be true.&nbsp; But my greatest fear is that they cannot stand wealth.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Ours then seems to be the toughest test of all for the evils are more subtle, more clever.&nbsp; It all seems less menacing and it is harder to detect.&nbsp; While every test of righteousness represents a struggle, this particular test seems like no test at all, no struggle and so could be the most deceiving of all tests.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Do you know what peace and prosperity can do to a people&mdash;It can put them to sleep.&nbsp; The Book of Mormon warned us of how [Satan], in the last days, would lead us away carefully down to hell.&nbsp; The Lord has on the earth some potential spiritual giants whom He saved for some six thousand years to help bear off the Kingdom triumphantly, and the devil is trying to put them to sleep.&nbsp; The [adversary] knows that he probably won&rsquo;t be too successful in getting them to commit many great and malignant sins of commission.&nbsp; So he puts them into a deep sleep, like Gulliver, while he strands them with little sins of omission.&nbsp; And what good is a sleepy, neutralized, lukewarm giant as a leader?</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We have too many potential spiritual giants who should be more vigorously lifting their homes, the kingdom, and the country.&nbsp; We have many who feel they are good men [and women], but they need to be good for something&mdash;stronger patriarchs, courageous missionaries, valiant [family history and] temple workers, dedicated patriots, devoted quorum members.&nbsp; In short, we must be shaken and awakened from a spiritual snooze&rdquo; ("Our Obligation and Challenge" [address delivered at regional representatives seminar] Sept. 30, 1977, 2-3). </em></p>
<p>Consider, brothers and sisters, that affluence, prosperity, and ease can be tests in our day equal to or greater in intensity than the persecution and physical hardships endured by the Saints who volunteered to march in Zion&rsquo;s Camp.&nbsp; As the prophet Mormon described in his magnificent summary of the pride cycle contained in Helaman 12:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One&mdash;yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.&rdquo; (Helaman 12:1-2)</em></p>
<p>I invite you specifically to note the final phrase in the last verse&mdash;<strong>&ldquo;and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee likewise taught about the collective test of ease that we face in our day:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are tested, we are tried, we are going through some of the severest tests today and we don&rsquo;t realize perhaps the severity of the tests we are going through.&nbsp; In those days there were murderings, there were mobbings, there were drivings.&nbsp; They were driven out into the desert, they were starving and they were unclad, they were cold.&nbsp; They came here to this favored land.&nbsp; We are the inheritors of what they gave to us.&nbsp; But what are we doing with it?&nbsp; Today we are basking in the lap of luxury, the like of which we&rsquo;ve never seen before in the history of the world.&nbsp; It would seem that probably this is the most severe test of any test that we&rsquo;ve ever had in the history of this Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Christmas address to Church employees,&rdquo; Dec. 13, 1973, 4-5; unpublished transcript)</em></p>
<p>Now brothers and sisters, these teachings from modern and ancient prophets about latter&ndash;day tests and trials are sobering and solemn.&nbsp; But they should not be discouraging, and we should not be afraid.&nbsp; For those with eyes to see and ears to hear, spiritual warnings lead to increasingly vigilant watching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You and I live in &ldquo;a day of warning&rdquo; (D&amp;C 63:58). And because we have been and will be warned, we need to be, as the Apostle Paul admonished, &ldquo;watching &hellip; with all perseverance&rdquo; (Ephesians 6:18).&nbsp; As we watch and prepare, truly we have no need to fear (see D&amp;C 38:30).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s on the Lord&rsquo;s side?&nbsp; Now is the time to show that we have minds and hearts that accept and will be responsive to these inspired warnings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now is the time to show that we are watching and preparing to withstand the latter&ndash;day trials of prosperity and pride, of affluence and ease, and of hard hearts and forgetting the Lord our God.&nbsp; Now is the time to show that we will be true at all times in whatsoever things we are entrusted by our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son&mdash;and that we will keep the commandments of God and walk uprightly before Him (see Alma 53:20-21).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stalwart Saints in the army of the Lord were blessed to observe, to learn from, and to follow the Brethren.&nbsp; And we today can benefit greatly from the example and faithfulness of the devout members of Zion&rsquo;s Camp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to counsel from Parley P. Pratt, Wilford Woodruff traveled to Kirtland, Ohio, in April of 1834 to join Zion&rsquo;s Camp.&nbsp; Brother Woodruff&rsquo;s account of his first meeting with the Prophet Joseph Smith is instructive for all of us.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Here for the first time in my life I met and had an interview with our beloved Prophet Joseph Smith, the man whom God had chosen to bring forth His revelations in these last days.&nbsp; My introduction was not of a kind to satisfy the preconceived notions of the sectarian mind as to what a prophet ought to be, and how he should appear.&nbsp; It might have shocked the faith of some men.&nbsp; I found him and his brother Hyrum out shooting at a mark with a brace of pistols.&nbsp; When they stopped shooting, I was introduced to Brother Joseph, and he shook hands with me most heartily.&nbsp; He invited me to make his habitation my home while I tarried in Kirtland.&nbsp; This invitation I most eagerly accepted, and was greatly edified and blest during my stay with him.&nbsp; He asked me to help him tan a wolfskin which he said he wished to use upon the seat of his wagon on the way to Missouri.&nbsp; I pulled off my coat, stretched the skin across the back of a chair, and soon had it tanned&mdash;although I had to smile at my first experience with the Prophet.&rdquo; (in Matthias F. Cowley, Wilford Woodruff: History of His Life and Labors, [1909], 39)</em></p>
<p>I find it noteworthy that Brother Woodruff, who lived for a time in the Prophet&rsquo;s home and undoubtedly had a most remarkable opportunity to observe him in the routine of daily living, was blessed with eyes to see beyond the &ldquo;preconceived notions of the sectarian mind as to what a prophet ought to be, and how he should appear.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such false notions cloud the vision of many in the world today, both inside and outside of the Lord&rsquo;s restored Church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of my call in 2004 to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve, I have a decidedly distinctive perspective about what it means to observe, to learn from, and to follow the Brethren.&nbsp; I now see on a daily basis the individual personalities, the various preferences, and the noble characters of the leaders of this Church.&nbsp; Some people find the human limitations and shortcomings of the Brethren troubling and faith diminishing.&nbsp; For me, brothers and sisters, those weaknesses are faith promoting. The Lord&rsquo;s revealed pattern of governance in His Church provides for and attenuates the impact of human frailty.&nbsp; It is truly miraculous to me to witness the Lord accomplishing His will through His servants, in spite of the flaws and failings of His chosen leaders.&nbsp; These men never have claimed to be and are not perfect; they certainly are, however, called of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because he had eyes to see and ears to hear, Wilford Woodruff recognized that Zion&rsquo;s Camp was &ldquo;a great school for us to be led by a Prophet of God a thousand miles through cities, towns, villages, and through the wilderness&rdquo; (in Cowley, <em>Wilford Woodruff</em>, 40).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A priest when he walked to Missouri with the army of the Lord, Wilford Woodruff later declared while serving as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We gained an experience that we never could have gained in any other way. ...We had the privilege of traveling a thousand miles with [the Prophet], and seeing the workings of the spirit of God with him, and the revelations of Jesus Christ unto him and the fulfillment of those revelations. ... Had I not gone up with Zion&rsquo;s Camp I should not have been here today.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Discourse,&rdquo; Deseret News, Dec. 22, 1869, 547)</em></p>
<p>On the last Sunday in April 1834, Joseph Smith invited a number of the leaders of the Church to address the Zion&rsquo;s Camp volunteers gathered in a schoolhouse.&nbsp; After the brethren had concluded their messages, the Prophet arose and indicated that he had been edified by the instruction.&nbsp; He then prophesied:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I want to say to you before the Lord, that you know no more concerning the destinies of this Church and kingdom than a babe upon its mother&rsquo;s lap.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t comprehend it.&nbsp; It is only a little handful of Priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America&mdash;it will fill the world.&rdquo; (quoted by Wilford Woodruff, in Conference Report, Apr. 1898, 57)</em></p>
<p>Men such as Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, and Wilford Woodruff listened to and learned much from the Prophet that night&mdash;and years later helped to fulfill his prophetic pronouncement.&nbsp; What glorious opportunities these men had to observe, to learn from, and to follow the prophet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important for all of us to remember that we can learn both from the teachings of the Brethren and from the examples of their lives.&nbsp; Given the majestic vision of the future growth of the Church articulated by the Prophet Joseph Smith, please now consider the power of his personal example in the performance of routine and mundane but necessary tasks.&nbsp; George A. Smith described in his journal the reaction of the Prophet to the daily challenges of the march to Missouri.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Prophet Joseph took a full share of the fatigues of the entire journey.&nbsp; In addition to the care of providing for the Camp and presiding over it, he walked most of the time and had a full proportion of blistered, bloody and sore feet &hellip; But during the entire trip he never uttered a murmur or complaint, while most of the men in the Camp complained to him of sore toes, blistered feet, long drives, scanty supply of provisions, poor quality of bread, bad corn dodger, frowsy butter, strong honey, maggoty bacon and cheese, etc.&nbsp; Even a dog could not bark at some men without their murmuring at Joseph.&nbsp; If they had to camp with bad water, it would nearly cause rebellion. &nbsp;Yet we were the Camp of Zion, and many of us were prayerless, thoughtless, careless, heedless, foolish, or devilish, and yet we did not know it.&nbsp; Joseph had to bear with us and tutor us, like children.&nbsp; There were many, however, in the camp who never murmured and who were always ready and willing to do as our leaders desired.&rdquo; (Teachings of Presidents of the Church:&nbsp; Joseph Smith [2007], 287&ndash;88)</em></p>
<p>Joseph was a strong example of the principle found in the Book of Mormon:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;For the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; &hellip; and they did all labor, every man according to his strength.&rdquo; (Alma 1:26)</em></p>
<p>I am now blessed to learn from the teachings of the Brethren in our quorum and council meetings, in general conference, and in a variety of other settings.&nbsp; However, I learn most powerfully from their examples.&nbsp; Obviously, my day-to-day association with the Brethren provides me with opportunities to observe, learn from, and follow them that none of you have.&nbsp; But all of you, nonetheless, can be attentive to the unspoken sermons of the Brethren.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general conference last April, President Monson taught a memorable lesson without words.&nbsp; Sitting on the stand with his counselors a few minutes before one of the sessions was to begin, the president noticed in the congregation Brother Eldred G. Smith, the 103 year-old emeritus patriarch of the Church.&nbsp; I watched with both appreciation and reverence as President Monson walked quickly down into the audience, greeted and shook hands with Brother and Sister Smith, and then returned to his seat.&nbsp; This tender acknowledgment of a lifetime of faithfulness occurred quietly and with genuine love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his spoken sermons during the conference, President Monson did not speak extensively about thoughtfulness, appreciation, or graciousness&mdash;but his example taught those principles with great force to those of us in attendance.&nbsp; Now is the time to observe, to learn from, and to follow the example of God&rsquo;s living prophet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my call as a General Authority, I have tried to observe and learn as some of my Brethren have faced the effects of aging or the relentless demands of physical limitations and constant pain.&nbsp; You cannot and will never know the private and silent suffering some of these men live through as they serve publicly with all of their heart, might, mind, and strength.&nbsp; Serving with and watching President Hinckley, President Faust, Elder Wirthlin, and my other apostolic associates empower me to declare clearly and authoritatively that the Brethren with whom I serve are warriors&mdash;noble and great spiritual warriors&mdash;in the truest and most admirable sense of that word!&nbsp; Their patience, persistence, and courage enable them to &ldquo;press forward with a steadfastness in Christ&rdquo; (2 Nephi 31:20) that is worthy of our emulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee warned of an additional collective test that is growing ever more pervasive in this generation.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are now going through another test&mdash;a period of what we might call sophistication.&nbsp; This is a time when there are many clever people who are not willing to listen to the humble prophets of the Lord . . . It is rather a severe test.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Sweet Are the Uses of Adversity,&rdquo; Instructor, June 1965, 217)</em></p>
<p>The test of sophistication is the companion to the test of prosperity and ease.&nbsp; How important it is for each of us to observe, learn from, and follow the Brethren.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who is on the Lord&rsquo;s side?&nbsp; Now is the time to show by hearing and heeding the counsel of the living apostles and prophets called of God in these latter days to oversee and direct His work on the earth.&nbsp; Now is the time to show we believe that God&rsquo;s &ldquo;word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by [His] own voice or by the voice of [His] servants, it is the same&rdquo; (D&amp;C 1:38).&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, now is the time to show.&nbsp; The time is now!</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>At some point in each of our lives, we will be invited to march in our own Zion&rsquo;s Camp.&nbsp; The timing of the invitations will vary, and the particular obstacles we may encounter on the journey will be different.&nbsp; But our ongoing and consistent response to this inevitable call ultimately will provide the answer to the question &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s on the Lord&rsquo;s side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the times to show is now, today, tomorrow, and forever May we ever remember the related lessons of testing, sifting and preparing&mdash;and of observing, learning from, and following the Brethren.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>English Faculty Member</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A recently returned missionary who had just joined the Ricks College 42<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Ward approached me, the bishop at the time, and said that he had just read Elder Dallin H. Oaks' talk, "Bishop Help," where Elder Oaks invites members to help the bishop. "Bishop," he said, "what can I do to help you?" Without hesitation I returned, "Date every sister in the ward." He chuckled and then quit smiling when he saw that I was serious. He hesitated, and then said, "I'll do my best."<br /><br />Each Sunday, I knew which sister had gone out with him on Saturday because she wore a huge smile and constantly watched the door for his arrival. He was handsome, spiritual, kind, intellectual, and talented. In fact, each week, most of the sisters turned when he walked into the Kirkham Auditorium, where we held Sacrament Meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a sister in that ward who was often discouraged. We visited most Sundays and together we would review her week and her frustrations. I was not sure how to help her. She was discouraged that she had been at Ricks College for three years without a single date. I would strive to buoy her up each week, but I couldn't find long-term solutions until one Sunday morning when she walked in with a huge smile on her face. She cornered me after Sacrament Meeting and described how one of the brothers in the ward had asked her on a date for the previous Saturday. They had gone horseback riding down on the Henry's Fork property, leaving early in the morning and not returning until evening. The young man had prepared a wonderful picnic and had treated her like a queen. "Bishop," she said, "I know that he is not pursuing me romantically. In fact, I know that you assigned him to date every sister in the ward, but he treated me like a daughter of God."&nbsp;<br /><br />At the end of the semester, the young man found me one Sunday after meetings and asked if he could give an accounting of his assignment. We sat down in the bishop's office and he began. "I'm here to ask for forgiveness. I haven't even dated half of the sisters in the ward." I assured him that he had been inspired in his choices. He interrupted and said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Bishop, I don't think that I blessed the lives of these sisters; they blessed mine. I was dating the wrong kind of girl. I was looking mostly at their physical bodies and not at who they are spiritually. I now know what kind of woman I want to marry, and physical appearance is hardly a consideration. I learned so much from the sisters in our ward."</em></p>
<p>His faithful action helped others and taught him much. Being an English teacher, I know that faith isn't a verb. It is a noun that should be accompanied by an appropriate verb, an appropriate action verb is best! Yes, faith invites action, brothers and sisters.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know of another fine sister who was nervous when she arrived at BYU-Idaho. She was quiet and even afraid at times. This was long after I had served as a bishop, but I taught this young lady in an English class. Through an odd series of events, we shared a trust to the point where she asked me how she could feel included in her ward.&nbsp;<br /><br />Whenever I answer a question like this without hesitation, I give credit to the Holy Ghost. I immediately responded, "Ask the bishop if you can help him by being a ward greeter." Sometimes this responsibility is mocked by those with less understanding of baptismal covenants. This young sister, after being reminded a couple of times, asked her bishop if she could serve him and the ward in that effort. He consented and so she began. She would report to me each week about how many new names she had memorized. Then she started writing notes to some of the ward members. Soon, she knew almost everyone--greeting ward members by name each Sunday. She transformed into the most outgoing and beautiful young student I have ever met. She had dozens and dozens of friends who loved her because she had loved them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Again, I submit that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Faith is a principle of action and power. Whenever you work toward a worthy goal, you exercise faith. You show your hope for something that you cannot yet see." (True to the Faith p. 54)</em></p>
<p>Most of you are enjoying new beginnings--like the two students in the stories. My first desire is to get you to take faithful action during your time at BYU-Idaho. And please realize that faith as a principle of action and power does not just apply to this new beginning. Every time you move to a new ward in your lives, ask the bishop how you can help; get to know every member's name. If you do these two things, I promise you that you will find Christ in every ward in the church.&nbsp;<br /><br />Making that promise reminds me of President Hinckley's inspired direction concerning new converts:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"It is not an easy thing to become a member of this Church. In most cases it involves setting aside old habits, leaving old friends and associations, and stepping into a new society which is different and somewhat demanding."<br /></em><em>"With the ever-increasing number of converts, we must make an increasingly substantial effort to assist them as they find their way. Every one of them needs three things: a friend, a responsibility, and nurturing with 'the good word of God' (Moroni 6:4). It is our duty and opportunity to provide these things." (Gordon B. Hinckley, "Converts and Young Men," Ensign, May 1997, p. 47)</em></p>
<p>Do you see the connection? When we take faithful action, we begin to have friends, responsibilities, and gospel nourishment. We become self-sufficient and begin to provide these things for others. We begin keeping baptismal covenants because of our choices that develop our faith.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"In order for your faith to lead you to salvation, it must be centered in the Lord Jesus Christ...Remember that because He has experienced all your pains, afflictions, and infirmities, he knows how to help you rise above your daily difficulties." (True to the Faith p. 54)</em></p>
<p>My favorite example of a person who has faith, and is not a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a babushka from Moscow, Russia. Ours was a short, but powerful few minutes together. I was directing a group of 35 Ricks College students through Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Western Europe. We had been together a few weeks when we had opportunity to visit the Tretyakov Art Museum, in Moscow.&nbsp;<br /><br />Frankly, I was happy when all of the students headed into every part of the museum except the wing that housed religious icons, religious paintings, in this case, of the Russian Orthodox Church that teach members about Christ and other spiritual matters. I delight in the faith it must have taken for these painters to carefully paint about Christ. I also delighted in the solitude I would find. I smiled at the museum attendant, the babushka, as I entered the religious art wing of the museum. She did not smile back. I knew I did not want to be on her bad side. Those older Russian women are known for their tough demeanor--I also knew that she would win any verbal encounter.&nbsp;<br /><br />I moved past her to a very old icon, one that was not protected in any way. It was hundreds of years old. I bent toward it to see the inevitable cracks that had developed over the centuries, and I must have gotten too close. She flew out of her chair screaming nelzya, nelzya--"it is forbidden." I apologized and moved around the corner to get out of her sight. As I rounded the partition, there was a small four-foot square table and under plexiglass was another icon, a very old icon. It portrayed Christ's birth in a cave, in a stable, in a manger. There was the Christ child. The Holy Ghost overwhelmed me, testifying that Christ was born to Mary and put in a manger. That it was all true.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tears gently flowed--I had known that Christ lived, but I had never known it this clearly, this profoundly. As I basked in the moment, I made a nearly fatal mistake. I leaned on the plexiglass to look closer at the dozen or so little circles that had been painted around the cave, little circles with painted representations of the prophesies of Christ's birth. Elizabeth and Zacharius, Simeon, Anna, and others. As I leaned on the plexiglass, the babushka tore around the corner screaming "Nelzya, nelzya." I turned to meet my doom, but then she saw my tears.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Vy ponimayete, da?" "You understand, don't you?"&nbsp;<br /><br />"Yes," I said, "I understand." She explained to me that she loves to work in this wing of the museum because she loves Jesus Christ. She feels Him there; I had felt the Holy Ghost there also. She serves the Savior in this way, requesting to work that wing every shift because it is a way for her to faithfully take action.&nbsp;<br /><br />Notice that she took action based on her faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />True faith and action in Jesus Christ leads to repentance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Repentance is much more than just acknowledging wrongdoings. It is a change of mind and heart that gives you a fresh view about God, about yourself, and about the world." (True to the Faith p. 132)</em></p>
<p>In preparation for this talk, my wife, Susan, reminded me of a time when my daughter learned a tough lesson: choices have consequences. Carly, just a few years old at the time, and her brother, Greg, had planned a family sleep-out. It was evening and we were ready to get the sleeping bags situated on the tarp. The kids had spent the afternoon playing in the water. Susan had taken them in and bathed them while I finished some work in the yard. Carly was clean and dry. She headed toward the small swimming pool-- "Don't get in that water, or we won't get to sleep out," Susan and I chimed in unison.&nbsp;<br /><br />With a mischievous smile, Carly waltzed right into the pool. We took measured action, pulling her from the water and informing her that she would be unable to sleep outside. She cried, but she wasn't truly upset until she found Greg crying because he did not want to sleep outside if Carly could not. Nobody would sleep out because she disobeyed. It was a solemn night at the Grant house. We all cried. Bedtime stories didn't hold any joy. Prayers were quietly said. If it was not a powerful lesson for the children, it was for Susan and me. We saw the world in a new way as we realized that even small choices have powerful consequences for bad and good. I believe that our family changed for the better that night as we sought understanding.&nbsp;<br /><br />This experience helped me understand Moses 6:55-57:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"...and they taste the bitter, that they may know to prize the good."</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"And it is given unto them to know good from evil; wherefore they are agents unto themselves, and I have given unto you another law and commandment."</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence; for, in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time."</em></p>
<p>"Repentance is a painful [but necessary] process, [and] it leads to forgiveness and lasting peace." (<em>True to the Faith</em>&nbsp;p. 133)&nbsp;<br /><br />Do we really believe this? If it leads to lasting peace, shouldn't it be an important part of your experience at BYU-Idaho. I invite us to repent right now, to see God and ourselves differently. Along with a new beginning during this summer term can come a lasting peace that helps us become a new person.&nbsp;<br /><br />So far, we have mentioned faith with action and repentance as a part of the process that leads to us becoming new people. The repentance leads to baptism, where new converts can see themselves fresh, clean, and pure. We, too, have that blessing each week as we partake of the sacrament.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Book of Mormon tells of a group of people who learned the gospel and were baptized at a place called Mormon. From the time of their baptism, they regarded Mormon as a place of beauty because while they were there, they "came to the knowledge of their Redeemer" (see Mosiah 23-23).&nbsp;<br /><br />Like the people in the Book of Mormon account, you can rejoice as you remember your baptismal covenant and the Lord's promises to you. You can find strength in the ordinance of baptism, whether you were baptized recently or many years ago." (<em>True to</em><em>&nbsp;the Faith&nbsp;</em>p. 21)&nbsp;<br /><br />Mercedes Panichi was baptized many years ago while living in Mons, Belgium. In 1982, she lost her husband to cancer and was raising an infant son. After receiving the missionary lessons, and after telling the missionaries that she could never be worthy of baptism, she wanted to become a member of the church. After much work toward repentance, she decided that Christ's atonement could work for her too.&nbsp;<br /><br />When she found herself in the font, anxiety filled her face. Brother Renard pronounced the baptismal prayer and gently put Mercedes under the water. As her face broke the water on the way up, she greeted the world with a smile and wept for joy. "I am clean. I am clean," she said. Then she spontaneously bore testimony that Jesus is the Christ; that Joseph is a prophet and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has authority from God. It was the sweetest testimony I have ever heard.&nbsp;<br /><br />As you partake of the sacrament this week, remember Christ, His birth, His baptism, His death, and His life. I promise that each of us can feel that joy that led to Mercedes' testimony. And we will be clean.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of us has demonstrated faith in the Lord Jesus Christ unto repentance. This led to our baptisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />2 Nephi 32:1-2 teaches us about the next step:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>" And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after ye have entered in by the way. But, behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?"</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?"</em></p>
<p>We now need to understand the gift of the Holy Ghost if we want to understand more fully the doctrine of Christ that leads to us becoming like Christ.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The Gift of the Holy Ghost is different from the influence of the Holy Ghost. Before your baptism, you could feel the influence of the Holy Ghost from time to time, and through that influence you could receive a testimony of the truth. Now that you have the gift of the Holy Ghost, you have the right to the constant companionship of that member of the Godhead if you keep the commandments." (True to the Faith p. 83)</em></p>
<p>Wow! What a gift, the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. Have you noticed that in all of the experiences I have shared about faith, repentance, baptism, and the Holy Ghost, all of the stories are about all four of the first principles and ordinances of the gospel? Nephi calls it the Doctrine of Christ in 2 Nephi 32. He is trying to convince his wayward brothers that scriptures tell us all things that we should do and that the Holy Ghost can show us--can guide us in all things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do."</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark."</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do." (2 Nephi 32:3-5)</em></p>
<p>Nephi's powerful invitation to understand the doctrine of Christ requires that we gain understanding through scripture study and prayer so that we can understand faith, repentance, baptism, and the Gift of the Holy Ghost--our invitation is to have faith in Christ, repent, be baptized, and receive the Holy Ghost. Then, a member of the Godhead will show us all things that we should do.&nbsp;<br /><br />Shouldn't we seek these powerful blessings, especially if it is as easy as making efforts to learn through more effective prayer and scripture study? I have learned to ask Father in Heaven constantly for His help; in so doing, I am learning to listen better.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes, I worry that with the freedom of choice that you enjoy while being away from home for the first time, that you will not remember to ask Heavenly Father for help, that you may not work toward having the Holy Ghost as your constant companion. I have had two students get into serious accidents the last four years. In both cases, when they told me what they were doing, I wondered if they were seeking fun, enjoyment, and recreation with or without the Spirit's guidance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Check in with Heavenly Father, and listen to the Holy Ghost, as you enjoy BYU-Idaho, Rexburg, and the recreational opportunities that this area offers. Understand the doctrine of Christ, and Heavenly Father will teach you His will. Then you will find yourself in the right place at the right time and not in harrowing situations that could lead to needless consequences that affect others.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, in closing, I want to share with you an important experience in my life that demonstrated to me what happens when we seek to understand a part of the doctrine of Christ and take action with that understanding.&nbsp;<br /><br />On a later trip to Moscow, Russia, with another group of college students, we were scheduled to attend sacrament meeting in a branch just outside of the main city. It would take about forty-five minutes on the metro, and then a 15 minute walk. The metro was empty at 7:30 a.m. Interestingly enough, the nearly 40 of us all crammed into one car, so I decided to stand and hold on to a pole.When I travel short or long distances, I make it a habit to pray, to check in with Heavenly Father. As I prayed, I told him how thankful I was for a Savior who loves me. Soon, I had a distinct impression that I could do better. In fact, I felt quite chastised and ashamed to the point of a few tears. I knew that I wasn't guilty of any grievous sin, but the Holy Ghost taught me about sins of omission. I was a bit embarrassed by the tears and the tears made some of the students nervous, but I saw it as an opportunity to repent, so I asked Heavenly Father's forgiveness and promised that I would do better.&nbsp;<br /><br />On the walk to the chapel, I kept behind the others, feeling a bit hurt that I wasn't who the Lord needed at the time. I resolved to do much better. We arrived at the chapel. There was a flurry of activity as the six missionaries from America realized that there were nearly 40 Americans who had just walked in. I sought a seat in the back. I watched carefully, as I am prone to do. As I watched and heard the details, I became a bit indignant. I had always wanted to serve a mission in Russia, but there were no Russian missions when I served in 1981. I had adored my mission to France and Belgium, but I was upset that some of the missionaries were complaining about food and culture. I reminded myself that I needed to prepare for the sacrament. We still had 20 minutes before the meeting would start.&nbsp;<br /><br />I noticed a woman quietly going about her business. I assumed she was Russian and not a missionary. She was seated behind the piano, so I could not see her fully. I noticed that the Branch President and others spoke with her. She played the opening hymn. For some reason, the Holy Ghost whispered that she was a powerful woman, and that I needed to relay that message to her. After the sacrament and a testimony by the Branch President, she moved to the podium. I thought that she was going to bear her testimony. She sat down by the microphone, and then I realized that she was a sister missionary&nbsp;moving to translate for any of the Americans who wanted to bear testimony, and several did.&nbsp;<br /><br />She had been unaffected when we arrived. She had gone about her duties as a missionary and branch member in powerful ways. The Spirit whispered, "Tell her that she is a powerful missionary, the kind you wanted to be in France and Belgium, and the kind you would have wanted to have been in Russia." This prompting occurred several times before the meeting ended.&nbsp;<br /><br />After the meeting, I watched her speak with several of the Branch members. I positioned myself so that I could speak with her. "Sister," I started, "Are you staying for all three meetings?" She said yes. "Could I speak with you at the end of the block?" She affirmed that I could. Then she asked me if I would write down the names of the students who had participated as she had promised the ward clerk that she would get them so that he could have an accurate record. She moved on to Sunday School where she powerfully interacted with the members and helped with the lesson. I was overwhelmed at her goodness and how much the Spirit wanted her to know that she was an awesome missionary.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the end of the block of meetings, she came to me. I did not have to find her. She asked for the list of students. Then, she said, "You wanted to talk to me?"&nbsp;<br /><br />I replied,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Sister, I have been overwhelmed by the Spirit wanting me to tell you what a great missionary you are. I know that some of the other Elders and Sisters have not caught on to the blessing of serving these people, but the Holy Ghost wants you to know that you are a great missionary."</em></p>
<p>Quietly she sobbed into her hands, trying to regain control of her emotions. I wasn't nervous; the Holy Ghost was present and He had carefully guided me in what I was to say. After many seconds, she looked me in the face. My tears started. She said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Brother, I leave for home in three days. All I ever wanted to do was serve an acceptable mission for the Savior. I have been praying for weeks for an answer; I have been fasting to know. I now know that I have."</em></p>
<p>It wasn't appropriate to hug; she never would have. She was too respectful of the Savior, of her mission, of the mission rules. We grasped hands and arms. We looked into each other's eyes and parted ways. I assume that we will never meet again.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am grateful to God for the faith I have found in Jesus Christ. I continually use repentance, knowing the power of the atonement of Jesus Christ. I am grateful for baptismal covenants that bind us together as children of our Heavenly Father. And I am most grateful for the Holy Ghost. I strive with all my heart to be worthy of the Spirit that He might always be with me and testify to me of Jesus Christ. The Spirit leads me to the Savior and my Savior will lead me back to the Father.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"And it came to pass after I, Nephi, having heard all the words of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a vision, and also the things which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost, which power he received by faith on the Son of God--and the Son of God was the Messiah who should come--I, Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times of old as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the children of men."</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"For he is the same yesterday, today, and forever; and the way is prepared for all men from the foundation of the world, if it so be that they repent and come unto him."</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round."</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"Therefore remember, O man, for all thy doings thou shalt be brought into judgment." (1 Nephi 10:17-20)</em></p>
<p>May we strengthen our faith, always, but especially in new situations. May we repent, always, but especially in new situations. May we always remember Him, our Savior, through the sacrament which means so much because of baptism. And He will send His Spirit to be with us always. And, my dear friends, as we take action, and we must take action, the Spirit will guide all of us, through baptismal covenants, in helping each other. Then, the love that we develop will make us like the Savior. Like it says in Moroni 7:47-48:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him."</em><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure..."</em></p>
<p>...is also my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>My brothers and sisters, I am honored to be here with you today.&nbsp; I have a great love for BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; I love and appreciate all of you students, primarily because you keep me young at heart. &nbsp;I know that I will not teach you anything new today.&nbsp; My hope is that I will help you think a little more about what you should do and accomplish while here at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; I pray the Lord&rsquo;s spirit to be with me that I might be able to share my thoughts and my testimony with you, that my heart may speak to your heart and that you will feel of His spirit here today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After both my parents passed away, my five sisters and I had the task of cleaning out their home to prepare it for sale.&nbsp; Among the items we had to sort through were lots and lots of books.&nbsp; My mother and father loved to read.&nbsp; My mom read some books over and over.&nbsp; We found old books that I remember reading when I was a child, as well as new books which looked like they had hardly been opened.&nbsp; We all took back the books that we had given them and then divided the rest.&nbsp; I stored mine in a box for several months before I had a chance to go through them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, while sorting through the books, one of them caught my eye.&nbsp; It looked brand new on the outside, like it had never been opened. I put it on my bookshelf and moved on, thinking I should read it someday when I have more time. &nbsp;Many times I would walk by this book and think, I should read this. &nbsp;Just a short time ago, I stopped and picked up the book and began to read.&nbsp; I found that my mom had indeed read the book, marked her favorite parts and had highlighted sentences.&nbsp; It was as though I could see what my mom thought was important in this book.&nbsp; The name of this book is &ldquo;Everyday Miracles, True Stories About God&rsquo;s Hand in Our Lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a compilation of stories by people who have experienced the Lord&rsquo;s hand in their lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a talk given by Elder Zwick, he explained that hands are one of the most symbolically expressive parts of the body.&nbsp; In Hebrew, &ldquo;yad,&rdquo; the most common word for &lsquo;hand&rsquo;, is also used metaphorically to mean power, strength, and might.<sup> 1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we were living in Great Falls, Montana, students from the deaf and blind school attended our ward. &nbsp;Anna was a young lady from the school who was in our young women&rsquo;s program.&nbsp; She was full of energy and life.&nbsp; Everyone loved her.&nbsp; I have a vivid picture of Anna in my mind as every Sunday she stood and repeated the Young Women&lsquo;s theme in sign language.&nbsp; When she came to the part &lsquo;receive the ordinances of the temple and enjoy the blessings of exaltation&rsquo;, Anna would sign with great enthusiasm.&nbsp; Her hands were expressive, convincing, and powerful as she bore testimony of her love of the gospel and the temple.&nbsp; I shall never forget the message she conveyed with her hands. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first consider the stages of our hands.&nbsp; To do this, I would like to use my family as the examples. The first stage is that of a child. &nbsp;These hands are just beginning life&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; My grandchildren&rsquo;s hands are tiny and so perfect. Who can resist placing your finger within the grip of a tiny child? &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a child takes the hand of an adult, they trust that they will be led, directed and protected throughout their whole life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are the hands of a woman. &nbsp;These hands serve, direct, nurture and guide others to live better.&nbsp; My daughters&rsquo; hands are still in the process of guiding and teaching their children. &nbsp;My mother&rsquo;s hands were stiff with arthritis, but they worked steadily for 88 years in crocheting, doing family history research, humanitarian projects, and serving her family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hands of a father are strong and will work their whole life to provide and care for their family. A child trusts that his father&rsquo;s hand will lead him down the right path and teach him the things he needs to know.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s hands were rough and worn from farming and landscaping much of the BYU-Idaho campus and caring for others around him. &nbsp;He loved to help the widows in his ward by trimming their trees and he found joy in caring for his garden and yard.&nbsp; My husband&rsquo;s hands are a bit worn from giving much service at home, in church callings, at the temple, and in providing for our family.&nbsp; He has packed and moved boxes and furniture for each of our 23 moves, so they deserve to be a bit tired and worn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I look at mine, I realize that they are aging and more worn than in years past. &nbsp;They have loved working at BYU-Idaho, serving in Church callings and at the temple, nurturing children and grandchildren, and hope there are a few more years of service left in them. &nbsp;Now take a good look at your hands. &nbsp;They are in the process of preparing for the future.&nbsp; They will open many books and prepare many papers over the next few years and hopefully serve wherever and whenever they are needed.&nbsp; Each of our hands is at a different stage of life.&nbsp; Some have accomplished much while others are just beginning.&nbsp; All of these stages of hands shape lives and touch hearts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as I have thought about my loved ones&rsquo; hands, I have also thought about my Savior&rsquo;s hands and what they must have been like.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mormon states:&nbsp; &ldquo;Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God?&nbsp; Know ye not that he hath all power?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Mormon 5:23).&nbsp; What a great scripture! &nbsp;Picture in your mind the authority and power of God&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that in His younger years Christ learned the trade of a carpenter so I visualize His hands as strong and sturdy. &nbsp;We know that they were never idle and that He always used them in serving others. The powerful hand of the Lord created the very world we live in. &nbsp;With His hands he drove the moneychangers from the temple, guided Moses in the wilderness, gave sight to the blind and healed the lepers.&nbsp; I also envision them as loving and tender as he blessed the sick and the little children. &nbsp;I thought of all the times His hands healed the wounds of those who suffered spiritually and physically.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Peter began to sink into the sea because of his unbelief, Jesus rescued him &ldquo;And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him&rdquo; (Matthew 14:31).<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He promised us in D&amp;C 84:88,<em> </em>&ldquo;I will go before your face.&nbsp; I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you see how the Lord&rsquo;s hands are capable of all things?&nbsp; They can heal us, comfort us, express love to us, save us, and guide us by helping to bear us up.&nbsp; How do you picture the Savior&rsquo;s hands?&nbsp; If we can learn to recognize His love, influence, and generosity in our lives we will be greatly blessed and guided throughout our life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an illustration, I would like to share with you a personal experience where I was taught to recognize and give thanks for the Lord&rsquo;s hand in my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My husband and I were married in 1970.&nbsp; He graduated from BYU and ROTC and was commissioned as an officer in the Air Force in 1972.&nbsp; Thus began our career with our first assignment to pilot training in Lubbock, Texas.&nbsp; We moved into what we considered a rather nice duplex home at Reese Air Force Base. Craig absolutely loved flying. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t mind getting up at 3:00 am to study and then reporting to the flight-line for a 12 hour work day.&nbsp; We had a great career and future in the Air Force, wonderful friends and neighbors, a great ward, and a beautiful daughter, Jennifer.&nbsp; Craig served as the Elder&rsquo;s Quorum president and I served in our Relief Society presidency.&nbsp; Life was just so good!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December, 1972, we took time off from pilot training to go home to Idaho and Utah for Christmas.&nbsp; It was on our way back to Lubbock in early January that I noticed Craig was having some problems.&nbsp; It seemed like every time he picked something up with his right hand, it would simply slip right through his fingers.&nbsp; Once, while stopping at a Dairy Queen in Utah, we were on our way out to the car and he dropped the sack of food three times.&nbsp; While attending church in Moab, Utah, he couldn&rsquo;t pick up the sacrament and in Elder&rsquo;s Quorum he struggled with signing his name on the roll.&nbsp; When we got home to Lubbock, I insisted that he go into the doctor to make sure everything was okay.&nbsp; The next week, while at his appointment, Craig called to tell me the doctor wanted him to go to the Air Force neurological center in San Antonio for some tests.&nbsp; The doctor asked if I would want to join him but Craig said probably not because we had a 6 month old daughter and that would be hard for both of us to go.&nbsp; He was then put on the afternoon flight from Lubbock to San Antonio. &nbsp;The next morning, he called and said to me, &ldquo;I think you better come down and be with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; You see, while Craig was in the doctor&rsquo;s office, he looked at his own medical file lying on the doctor&rsquo;s desk and it said, in bold red letters &ldquo;possible brain tumor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Apparently, no one had felt it was necessary to tell him that the doctor was actually looking for a brain tumor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He asked me to call our families and let them know. &nbsp;The next day, Craig&rsquo;s brother and his wife left SLC, picked up Craig&rsquo;s dad in Moab, Utah and drove straight through to Lubbock.&nbsp; They stopped in Lubbock at our home, had a short nap and we were off to San Antonio.&nbsp; Just prior to their arrival, my home teacher and his wife were on my doorstep wanting to help.&nbsp; I learned that news travels fast throughout a military squad room.&nbsp; They offered to take Jennifer to stay with them for whatever time I needed to be gone.&nbsp; I hated to leave our daughter but I knew I needed to be with my husband.&nbsp; So we packed her bag and she was off to their home.&nbsp; Steve and Donna Jensen became the Lord&rsquo;s hands, serving my family.&nbsp; At this time, Craig and I had been married only 2 1/2 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we arrived in San Antonio, Craig told us that they were going to do a test called a numoinsephlagram the next morning and if they found what they thought they would find, they would immediately do surgery for a brain tumor. &nbsp;This was before the age of MRI&rsquo;s or CAT scans.&nbsp; That night, my father-in-law gave Craig a blessing of health and healing and told him that brain surgery would not be needed.&nbsp; He blessed us with faith to deal with whatever lay ahead of us.&nbsp; He blessed us that the doctors would be guided and that we would trust in their skill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next morning, after the procedure, the doctor came out and told us that as they watched the air go through the brain, they were unable to find any tumor.&nbsp; So, for now, there would be no surgery.&nbsp; My father-in-law, brother, and sister in-law left the next day and went back to Utah.&nbsp; I waited to fly home to Lubbock with Craig a week later.&nbsp; At first, his check-ups were scheduled every three months. Then they went to every six months, then to yearly and finally every 5 years. &nbsp;After the first year, they diagnosed his problem as a cranial disease of undetermined ideology. &nbsp;In other words, they had no idea what had happened.&nbsp; Throughout the years, the tests have always shown scar tissue which means that something happened but they just weren&rsquo;t sure what<em>. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The doctor recommended that we stay in the Air Force for the time being because if we got out, he would be un-insurable.&nbsp; We were also advised not to have any more children because I could be left a widow raising children alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a period of time, Craig was told he couldn&rsquo;t fly again.&nbsp; After much fasting and prayer, we followed the counsel about staying in the Air Force but the spirit told us otherwise about having children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By virtue of not flying again, we realized that this was a life changing experience.&nbsp; This was a hard time for us because all Craig had ever wanted to do was fly.&nbsp; He would never again have the thrill of pulling G&rsquo;s and soaring among the clouds. &nbsp;This change would affect all aspects of our military career.&nbsp; We would not be stationed at the same bases, meet the same people or do the same things.&nbsp; We would truly be on a different path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the young age of 22, I recognized that living righteously does not guarantee bad things would never happen to me.&nbsp; The Lord tells us, &ldquo;lean not on thine own understanding&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, for me, I couldn&rsquo;t lean on my own understanding because I had very little.&nbsp; I had to lean on the Lord&rsquo;s hand to help me bear my burden, guide and direct me, love me, and comfort me.&nbsp; Many hours were spent in fasting and prayer to be able to understand and learn what the Lord would have us do. We ultimately agreed together, that we would go and we would do whatever the Lord wanted us to.&nbsp; We knew from this experience and from our prayers that the Lord had a plan for us.&nbsp; We were committed to be faithful in all things and let the Lord&rsquo;s hand direct our life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through our experience, I also learned that I had to become more aware of happenings around me.&nbsp; I knew the Lord had reached into my life and because of His goodness I now had to reach out to those around me and touch their lives.&nbsp; My experience is truly a story about God&rsquo;s hand in our lives.&nbsp; I cannot begin to tell you of all the small miracles that happened to us each and every day.&nbsp; I felt the Lord&rsquo;s hand over and over blessing both of us and our family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In every ward, in every stake, in every family and situation around us, there are those who have felt the Lord&rsquo;s hand in their lives.&nbsp; Their experiences may not be as serious as mine, some have been even more difficult and some are very simple but all of them are very real.&nbsp; Each of us must know that through any kind of trial, the strength of the Lord is waiting for us if we put our hand in His.&nbsp; Since starting to prepare this talk, I began keeping a small notebook journal.&nbsp; Every time I heard a story or felt an impression that related to the Lord&rsquo;s hand in lives around me, I would write it down. &nbsp;I wish I could share all those wonderful stories with you as examples of how the Lord reaches down every second of every day and touches our lives with little, small everyday miracles.&nbsp; Once we have felt the Lord&rsquo;s hand in our life, we have a responsibility to do His work here upon the earth and serve others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Uchtdorf said:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Christ knows how to minister to others perfectly.&nbsp; When the Savior stretches out His hands, those He touches are uplifted and become greater, stronger, and better people as a result.&nbsp; If we are His hands, should we not do the same?&rdquo;<sup> 2</sup></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the Hands of God to bring about this great work.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Alma 26:3</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;How do we learn to extend our hand and become His hands?&nbsp; Elder Zwick stated that clear instruction came from the Lord to Joseph Smith:&nbsp; &ldquo;Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me. . . .Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you&rdquo; (D&amp;C 19:23, 38).&nbsp; The Lord will provide sustenance and support if we are willing to open the door and receive His hand of divine assistance.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There must be a trust that if we put our hand in His, He will sustain us, lift us and help us to know how to reach out to others. &nbsp;Each of us can be that earthly angel who helps miracles happen.&nbsp; Thirty eight years ago, the Jensen&rsquo;s stretched forth their hands and became earthly angels by taking my child into their home.&nbsp; They had an 18-month old and a 3 year old.&nbsp; Taking in a six-month old was not an easy thing.&nbsp; But, they wanted to serve.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me share a few other simple examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2008, my mother passed away.&nbsp; For the last several months of her life, there were times when she had to have someone all day and all night with her.&nbsp; There were four of us siblings who lived close by and tried to take turns with shifts.&nbsp; Because my one sister and I were still working, we did the night shifts.&nbsp; However, with work and life&rsquo;s responsibilities, there were times when the night shift was very difficult.&nbsp; There was an earthly angel who stepped up and said, let me help. &nbsp;Mary Wheeler, a neighbor and friend, was one of those people who never said, call me if I can help.&nbsp; She was one of those people who said, &ldquo;here I am, put me to work.&rdquo;&nbsp; So there were many nights when we had conflicts or were worn out, that Mary would sit with my mom all night and help out. &nbsp;It may seem like such a simple thing to some, but to us, she was truly an instrument in the Lord&rsquo;s hand and an answer to our prayer.&nbsp; Her willingness to serve was a great example to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon graduation from BYU-Idaho, my son Brady and his wife Erika decided to go to China and teach English for six months until they could begin their masters programs in Colorado.&nbsp; Upon arrival in China, they were met by their Chinese sponsor who took them out to dinner, then to their apartment where they were left on their own. &nbsp;School wouldn't be starting for another two weeks so they had a lot of free time. &nbsp;Their sponsor said if they needed anything, she would be happy to show them. &nbsp;However, they didn't want to be a nuisance nor did they know what they needed, so they remained at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first several days were very lonely because they couldn&rsquo;t speak the language which hindered them getting around to do some sightseeing.&nbsp; They had a difficult time buying groceries because they couldn&rsquo;t read the labels, and the food they did have, they didn&rsquo;t know how to cook. The help they received from the Chinese teachers seemed like just enough to get by. Needless to say, they were feeling pretty alone and isolated.&nbsp; They began to wonder what in the world they were doing there.&nbsp; They also began praying that the Lord would help them and bless them to know what to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, a knock came on their door.&nbsp; It was a woman from Australian and her two daughters who had previously taught at the Chinese school. &nbsp;The family had heard that Brady and Erika had just moved in and felt impressed that they should come by to introduce themselves and give them an introduction to living in China from a foreigner's perspective. &nbsp;The daughters were so happy and willing to teach them how to get around and what to do.&nbsp; It was somewhat of an instant friendship.&nbsp; Was it a chance meeting or a coincidence?&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t think so and neither do I.&nbsp; You see, Brady served his mission in Australia and so there was somewhat of an immediate link with them.&nbsp; This family helped them to be able to get out and use the transportation system, find their way around, shop (even finding a Wal-Mart), and find food to eat and actually figure out how to cook it.&nbsp; They were soon ready to begin the school semester. The most interesting part of it all was that the Australian family was preparing to move to a different area and only remained in town a couple more days. They didn&rsquo;t need to come over and introduce themselves but something led them to do so. &nbsp;It was just a short time after this that another couple arrived from Canada.&nbsp; Brady and Erika were able to pass on their knowledge and befriend this couple.&nbsp; If you ask them, they will tell you that they truly felt the Lord&rsquo;s hand reach down into their lives and bless them as a direct answer to their prayers.&nbsp; In return, they knew they were to be His hands in helping someone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how do we become the most effective instrument to do the Lord&rsquo;s work?&nbsp; We are taught &ldquo;I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived&rdquo; (D&amp;C 52:14). &nbsp;The scriptures teach us the pattern which will help us navigate along life&rsquo;s path.&nbsp; One of my favorite sections of scripture to study is King Benjamin.&nbsp; His life teaches us how to be prepared to become an instrument and do His work by serving and loving others.&nbsp; I would like to show you the pattern I see in King Benjamin&rsquo;s teachings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>King Benjamin taught his sons &ldquo;I would that ye should remember to search them (meaning the records of scriptures) diligently, that ye may profit thereby&rdquo; (Mosiah 1:7).&nbsp; Our testimony and conversion comes through diligent study and prayer.&nbsp; When we are converted, we can be a light to others. Understanding the gospel will help us be obedient &ndash; thus we become truly converted.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind&hellip;I have been suffered to spend my days in your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you.&rdquo; </em>(Mosiah 2:11-12)</p>
<p>King Benjamin never thought of himself as better than his people and recognized that he had his own weaknesses. &nbsp;If we keep ourselves humble, we can be assured that pride will not enter into our lives.&nbsp; Our humility helps us to reach out to others just as King Benjamin reached out to his people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, and that ye should not be laden with taxes, and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne.&rdquo; (Mosiah 2:14)</em></p>
<p>King Benjamin loved his people and chose to serve them.&nbsp; Service is truly the gospel in action.&nbsp; It blesses both the giver and the receiver.&nbsp; It is a gospel element that helps us be in tune and hear promptings of the things that need to be done in this world. &nbsp;It is what helps us reach out and love our neighbor as ourself.&nbsp; Our service shows gratitude and love for Heavenly Father.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another and to serve one another&rdquo; (Mosiah 4:15).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.&rdquo; (Mosiah 2:17) </em></p>
<p>Gaining wisdom is a lifelong journey. &nbsp;When we serve our fellowman, we serve our God.&nbsp; As we serve, we gain the wisdom that will guide us and help us return to our Father in Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;That ye are eternally indebted to your Heavenly Father, to render him all that you have and are&rdquo; (Mosiah 2:34). Gratitude is what keeps us grounded.&nbsp; As we acknowledge the Lord&rsquo;s guidance and hand in our life, we learn who we are and what we should do. &nbsp;Life&rsquo;s experiences teach us how grateful we should be to the Lord for all that we are.&nbsp; For me, I learned early in life to acknowledge His hand and know that I would be forever indebted to Him. &nbsp;He helped guide me, and taught me to seek Him and to come unto Him.&nbsp; His guidance will also help us understand and know that each of us is a child of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never ending happiness.&rdquo; (Mosiah 2:41)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;Our example may be the catalyst that helps someone else to be taught the gospel.&nbsp; Being faithful to the end is what our purpose and goal should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Living our lives as King Benjamin taught will bring about a mighty change of heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us;. . .which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.&rdquo;</em> (Mosiah 5:2)</p>
<p>A change of heart helps us have no desire to do evil but to strive to do good in all things and serve our fellowman.&nbsp; Our heart is the center of our whole being.&nbsp; It gives life to our temporal body.&nbsp; But a mighty change of heart, as King Benjamin taught, gives life to our spiritual body.&nbsp; It helps us hold on to the iron rod and move forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you study King Benjamin&rsquo;s teachings and life, you will see that he gave us a pattern to teach us how to better serve and be the Lord&rsquo;s hands here upon this earth. The very best thing about King Benjamin&rsquo;s teachings is that he didn&rsquo;t just teach it, he lived it.&nbsp; He reached out to all around him through service and example.&nbsp; I am sure his hands were much like our Savior&rsquo;s hands, continually serving and teaching those he loved.&nbsp; The scriptures are filled with patterns that teach us how to serve and find our way home to our Father in Heaven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters&hellip;The ultimate pattern, example, and use of hands came from our elder brother, as He hung on a cross and was crucified.&nbsp; As the nails were hammered through His hands, He again offered His love to us. &nbsp;Just imagine the wounds in His hands.&nbsp; Those hands which had loved and served so many around him, were now sacrificing everything for you and me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet: be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Amen.&rdquo;</em> (D&amp;C 6:37)&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Monson said:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Pitied is the hand that sins. Envied is the hand that paints.&nbsp; Honored is the hand that builds.&nbsp; Appreciated is the hand that helps.&nbsp; Respected is the hand that serves.&nbsp; Adored is the hand that saves&mdash;even the hand of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Redeemer of all mankind.&nbsp; With that hand he knocks upon the door of our understanding.&nbsp; Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Revelations 3:20)<sup>3</sup></em></p>
<p>His hand knocks at the door and wants us to answer and let Him in.&nbsp; We have the opportunity every day to help and see hearts changed, prayers answered and burdens lightened through our hands of service and love.&nbsp; To those of us who have experienced these everyday miracles, we cannot deny that the windows of heaven have been opened to us and that the Lord&rsquo;s hand blesses and comforts us.&nbsp; Once we learn how to recognize the everyday miracles that occur in our lives, we must then become that earthly angel who helps others have miracles in their lives.&nbsp; You never know what small act can be a miracle to someone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What will you do today to be the Savior&rsquo;s hands? &nbsp;In 1 Nephi 17:13 we find that the Lord tells Nephi: <em>&ldquo;I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you.&rdquo; </em>&nbsp;The Lord offers to be our beacon, our light, and our guide to prepare the way for us, I believe, in all things. &nbsp;He says, I will be always be there for you. &nbsp;I ask each of you, since the Lord is so willing to be there for each of us, could we not be there for someone else?&nbsp; Could you not be willing to serve and be His light in someone else&rsquo;s life? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf taught:</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;When we reach out to bless the lives of others, our lives are blessed as well.&nbsp; Service and sacrifice open the windows of heaven, allowing choice blessings to descend upon us.&nbsp; Surely our beloved Heavenly Father smiles upon those who care for the least of His children.&nbsp; As we lift others, we rise a little higher ourselves.&nbsp; President Spencer W. Kimball taught, &lsquo;The more we serve our fellowmen in appropriate ways, the more substance there is to our souls.&rsquo;&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></em></p>
<p>How and what can you do?&nbsp; Every day, I watch students and employees across campus.&nbsp; I wonder, what&rsquo;s happening in their life?&nbsp; What are they thinking?&nbsp; Can I help anyone?&nbsp; &nbsp;My thought is usually the same, why aren&rsquo;t they looking up and enjoying the walk across campus?&nbsp; Take a minute and sit in the quad or in a building and watch other students.&nbsp; Notice those around you in class that could use a hello or a smile. &nbsp;Help out a roommate and be patient with those around you. Who knows, you may find a new friend or a date or a future spouse!&nbsp; Find someone you can serve. &nbsp;Sometimes the simplest thing can touch someone else&rsquo;s life and in return bless your own.&nbsp; Looking up and connecting with others is a simple thing, but I think it is a key to noticing and doing the Lord&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; You never know when a simple gesture may be the thing that brings light to someone else.&nbsp; I know from my own experiences, that if you serve, if you bring light to someone else, you will truly be the benefactor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our life is all about choices.&nbsp; The choices you make now will determine who and what you become in the future.&nbsp; Make the right choice today and choose to be the Master&rsquo;s hands here upon the earth.&nbsp; He works for each of us and through each of us.&nbsp; The Lord will reach down many times throughout your life to guide you, direct you, bless you, humble you, and teach you if you will but unlock the door and let Him in.&nbsp; In return, He expects you to lift the hands that hang down and reach out and bless others around you.&nbsp; As you leave today, I want you to think about how you can serve someone else. &nbsp;I want you to truly mean it when you sing our closing hymn, &ldquo;Savior, may I learn to love thee, Walk the path that thou hast shown, Pause to help and lift another, finding strength beyond my own&rdquo; (Hymns, 1985, no. 219).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2001, President Henry B. Eyring pronounced a blessing upon this university and all those who are here.&nbsp; He said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Now, I leave you my blessing ... I bless you that every day, if you will ask in prayer to be shown where the hand of God intervened in your life that day, I bless you that you will see that. It will be made manifest to you. That you will see that He is leading and guiding and lifting you, and that He knows you. I bless you with confidence that if you will review the day at the end of the day and then pray and ask, you will have revealed to you evidence that the hand of God was lifting you and this institution. I so bless you.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I further bless you that you may have the capacity to influence others. I bless you that you will be a lifter, a teacher, and a leader. I so bless you in your families, in the Church, and in wherever place you may go to serve.&rdquo;<sup> 5</sup></em></p>
<p>Throughout my life, I have experienced and continue to experience the everyday miracles and blessings from my Heavenly Father.&nbsp; I know that He watches over me and blesses me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray that you will ask to see how the Lord intervenes in your life on a daily basis.&nbsp; That you will recognize His hand as He teaches you, guides you, blesses you, and lifts you.&nbsp; I bear testimony to you that He will show you the everyday miracles and help you bless others along the way &ndash; if you will but ask.&nbsp; I know God lives.&nbsp; I know He watches over us and blesses us because He has an individual plan for each of us.&nbsp; I am grateful for His Hand in my life as he has blessed me and taught me through everyday miracles.&nbsp; My prayer is that we will strive to live worthy of the day when we can place our hand in the hand of our Savior and be welcomed home.&nbsp; Then will He say to us, &ldquo;Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the mansions of my Father&rdquo;&nbsp; (Enos:27).</p>

<p>As I searched for inspiration on a topic for today I felt the Spirit say to me, &ldquo;Help them remember who they are.&rdquo; Today I want to share with you the importance of remembering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my children were at home and before they went out on activities with friends I always said to them: &ldquo;Remember who and what you are.&rdquo; Did your parents not say the same to you? My children heard it so often they&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;yeah, dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what is significant about this word <em>remember</em>? What was it I wanted them to remember?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you look in the dictionary for the most important word, do you know what it is? It could be &lsquo;remember.&rsquo; Because all of [us] have made covenants&hellip;our greatest need is to remember. That is why everyone goes to sacrament meeting every Sabbath day&mdash;to take the sacrament and listen to the priests pray that [we] &lsquo;may always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given [us].&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Remember&rsquo; is the word&rdquo; (<em>Circles of Exaltation</em> [address to religious educators, Brigham Young University, 28 June 1968], 8).</p>
<p>President Bruce Blanchard, a counselor here on BYU-Idaho&rsquo;s campus, serves as a member of my stake presidency. In stake conference he told the story of a man he counseled when he lived in Utah before coming to BYU-I. The man was in prison and had actually served as a missionary in the same mission as President Blanchard. President Blanchard asked him &ldquo;How does a temple-endowed returned missionary, who bore testimony, end up in prison?&rdquo; The man simply answered &ldquo;I forgot who I was. I forgot my Savior.&rdquo; He forgot and fell away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go back to my counsel to my children of &ldquo;Remember who and what you are.&rdquo; <em>Who</em> are we? To know who we are today we must first ask who we were before we came to this earth. I have always thought that if I but could remember who and what I was in the premortal existence I would definitely strive to be more righteous. One of my greatest fears in life is that I will not live up to what was promised me in the premortal existence and I would allow earthly moments to over shadow eternal truths and the pleasures of the earth to beckon me from my course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a great blessing it would be if we could but remember that important time of decision. Think about it. We were in the Great Council where we were taught the Plan of Salvation. We accepted that divine plan, including the privilege and responsibility of becoming sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, and even grandparents. We understood life&rsquo;s challenges. We were willing to come to earth no matter the conditions; even if it meant being born in Tremonton, Utah, like I was. We accepted whatever body Heavenly Father would give us, for the privilege of having a body. For some we accepted bodies that may not be complete or whole. For some we knew we wouldn&rsquo;t be considered handsome&mdash;and that includes most of us. We knew our lives might be filled with great trials and challenges. Yet we knew as we came to earth that we would be tested and tried to see if we would do all things whatsoever the Lord would command us. We looked forward to proving ourselves. In Abraham we learn:</p>
<p>"<em>Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon&hellip;" (Abraham 3: 22, 26)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Were we one of the noble and great ones?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We kept our first estate. But, so did billions of others. So why are we different? Today, all of us were born under the covenant, or have received the covenant through baptism and temple endowment. Because of this blessing I believe we have in us this nobleness and great potential. We must have proven worthy in the premortal existence to have the gospel in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What promises did we make there? President Spencer W. Kimball taught, &ldquo;We made vows, solemn vows, in the heavens before we came to this mortal life&hellip;.We have made covenants.&hellip;We committed ourselves to our Heavenly Father, that if he would send us to the earth and give us bodies and give to us the priceless opportunities that earth life afforded we would keep our lives clean and would marry in the holy temple and would rear a family and teach them righteousness. This was a solemn oath, a solemn promise&rdquo; (&ldquo;&lsquo;Be Ye Therefore Perfect,&rsquo;&rdquo; devotional talk, University of Utah Institute of Religion, 10 Jan. 1975).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was your age I remember hearing the brethren talk about the chosen generation and how I, Joshua Holt, was one of the chosen. I&rsquo;m thinking, &ldquo;A kid from Tremonton, Utah is part of the chosen generation? Wow! I must be something.&rdquo; Then President Hinckley came along and said this about your generation:</p>
<p><em>"There are young people in the Church of whom I am proud and concerning whom I have a great sense of gratitude and a compelling sense of optimism. In saying this, I do not wish to imply that all is well with all of them&hellip;.But&hellip; I have great confidence in our young people as a whole. I regard you as the finest generation in the history of the Church. I compliment you, and I have in my heart a great feeling of love and respect and appreciation for you." (from Ensign, May 1992, 69)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What? I am no longer one of <em>THE </em>chosen generation?! I felt usurped. How could this be? I teach you students. Many a day goes by and I think &ldquo;Are you THE chosen generation?&rdquo; How could President Hinckley say this? This caused me to reread what Peter said about &ldquo;chosen generation.&rdquo; As I did I noticed a small word that stood out.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people&rdquo;</em> (1 Peter 2:9).</p>
<p>Peter didn&rsquo;t say <em>THE</em> chosen generation but <em>A</em> chosen generation. This meant that I still could be part of a chosen generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a professor, sometimes if I struggle with a student&rsquo;s effort and attitude to school and my class, if I but take the time to remember that they are sons or daughters of God it helps me change how I see them. I then start to see them as our loving Father in Heaven sees them and how Pres. Hinckley sees them when he made these remarks at the Hinckley Building dedication on this campus:</p>
<p>SLIDE: First, I want to tell you that I love you. I love you kids, you wonderful young people of this Church. I love you. I believe you are the best generation this Church has ever had. No generation which has gone before measures up to the stature to which you measure up&hellip;.&nbsp;God bless you for what you are and who you are. (2002)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interesting! Even a prophet wants you to remember who you are and what you are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Hinckley knew it was important to remind you who and what you are, because sometimes we forget. Darkness and shadow overcome us and we lose our way. When I was a campus ward Bishop there were times when I met with ward members who were struggling or who had broken commitments, commandments, and covenants. I wanted to ask them &ldquo;How could this happen?&rdquo; But just as with the returned missionary at the beginning of my talk, who was in prison, I knew the answer. They had forgotten who they were. Because if they remembered that they are sons and daughters of a Heavenly Father, they would never put themselves in situations where they failed to keep their covenants. We all falter. We get discouraged. We succumb to temptations. Sometimes we fall in moments weak, because the Adversary wants you to forget. Lucifer does not want you to remember. But the Lord has given us tools to help us bring our premortal memories into our daily thoughts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge to remember who and what we are even affects the noble and great ones. Today I want to briefly discuss four resources that will help us remember.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the scriptures have been written and preserved at great cost so that we can &ldquo;treasure up&rdquo; the truths of the gospel. We have a responsibility to know what these scriptures contain. Sister Joanne Doxey, a former member of the Relief Society General Presidency, suggested:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If we treat the scriptures lightly, letting them gather dust on the shelves, unopened and&nbsp;unread, they are unable to bless our lives as planned. We will be denied the sweet whisperings of the Spirit in guiding our lives and the lives of our families unless we pay the price of studying, pondering, and praying about the scriptures.&nbsp; If we immerse ourselves daily in the scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon, we will have increased discernment.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Now, please pay close attention to Sister Doxey&rsquo;s, next words:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We will have power to do good and to resist evil, and our ability to solve problems will be expanded. Messages to help us in our day were foreseen by the Lord and were divinely placed on the pages of the scriptures to assist us and our families&rdquo; (Remember Him, Ensign, Nov 1989, 89).</em></p>
<p>The scriptures help us solve our problems. They assist us in facing the challenges of our day. Reading the scriptures gives us insight on how others tried to remember who and what they are.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Note how many times King Benjamin in the Book of Mormon uses the word <em>remember.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates [meaning the scriptures], which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children&hellip;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also these records are true. &hellip;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God.&rdquo;</em> (Mosiah 1:3-4,6-7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If King Benjamin&rsquo;s people had not had the scriptures, they would have been like the Mulekites, who &ldquo;denied the being of their Creator&rdquo; (Omni 1:17).&nbsp; The scriptures are your first resource to remembering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, covenants. Anciently the Lord made covenants with His children to help them remember who they were and what was expected of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The children of Israel made covenants, and certain tokens were given to help them remember the Lord their God. But through disobedience they forgot, just like the Nephites forgot, and they reaped the consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our day, we again have a chance to make covenants to keep us in remembrance that we are sons and daughters of God desiring to return to His presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teaching the importance of ordinances and covenants cannot be taken casually by Latter-day Saints. SLIDE: Elder Boyd K. Packer shared his insight when he said: &ldquo;Ordinances and covenants become our credentials for admission into His presence. To worthily receive them is the quest of a lifetime; to keep them thereafter is the challenge of mortality&rdquo; (<em>Ensign,</em> May 1987, p. 24).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping our covenants should make a difference in the way we live, the way we act, the way we speak, the way we dress, the way we treat each other. If we &ldquo;always remember him,&rdquo; we will &ldquo;always have his Spirit to be with us&rdquo; (Moroni 4:3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, by worthily receiving the sacrament, we are blessed by the Spirit to enter into a wonderfully beneficial circle of remembering, returning again and again in our thinking and devotion to Christ and His Atonement. Going to the temple regularly allows us to remember the covenants we make there. If you are endowed, return regularly to do sealing and initiatory work. If you aren&rsquo;t endowed go regularly to do baptisms and confirmations. Temple attendance helps you remember your own covenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A third resource to help us remember who we are is to learn from the examples of those who remembered. Let&rsquo;s look at two individuals heavily involved in the restoration of the church. Both men we highly favored of the Lord, yet were contrasting examples: Oliver Cowdery and Hyrum Smith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oliver Cowdery shared with the Prophet Joseph Smith many of the profound events of the restoration. Oliver had witness after witness of the truth of the restoration. He shared with the Prophet Joseph the events of John the Baptist and Peter, James and John in restoring the priesthood and authority to baptize. He was a party to the marvelous appearances in the Kirtland Temple, becoming one of the three witnesses of the Book of Mormon and Moroni&rsquo;s visit. Oliver penned all but a few pages of the Book of Mormon as it fell from the lips of the Prophet Joseph. President Faust said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No one except the Prophet Joseph was more honored with the ministering of angels than Oliver Cowdery. But when the Prophet Joseph fell upon hard times, Oliver was critical of him and became estranged from him. Despite the efforts of the Prophet to reach out the hand of fellowship to him, he became hostile to the Prophet and the Church and was excommunicated&hellip;&rdquo; (James E. Faust, &ldquo;&lsquo;Some Great Thing&rsquo;, Liahona, Jan 2002, 53&ndash;56).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oliver allowed his thoughts and concerns of the moment to overcome his experiences in the past and distort what he saw of the future. He forgot who he was and what he had experienced He forgot all the spiritual witnesses that the Lord had given him. Because of this forgetting, he became blinded by his own personal ambition and lost his exalted place in the leadership of the Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet later, a few years after the Prophet Joseph died, Oliver remembered who and what he had been in the church. Realizing the errors of his past Oliver repented&nbsp;&nbsp;and expressed interest in coming back to the Church. Oliver appeared before the high council and said:</p>
<p><em>Brethren for a number of years I have been separated from you. I now desire to come back. I wish to come humbly and be one in your midst&hellip;I seek no station. I only wish to be identified with you... I wish to become a member of the church again.&hellip; I&hellip;handled with my hands the gold plates from which [the Book of Mormon] was translated. I also beheld the interpreters. That book is true. (Reuben Miller, journal, 1848&ndash;1849, Family and Church History Department Archives, 21 Oct. 1848; punctuation and spelling modernized).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He remembered his testimony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast, President Heber J. Grant said of Hyrum Smith:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There is no better example of an older brother&rsquo;s love than that exhibited in the life of Hyrum Smith for the Prophet Joseph Smith&hellip;.They were as united and as affectionate and as loving as mortal men could be. &hellip; There never was one particle of&hellip;jealousy&hellip;in the heart of Hyrum Smith. No mortal man could have been more loyal, more true, more faithful in life or in death than was Hyrum Smith to the Prophet of the living God&rdquo; (Heber J. Grant, &ldquo;Hyrum Smith and His Distinguished Posterity,&rdquo; Improvement Era, Aug. 1918, 854&ndash;55).</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In D&amp;C 124:15 the Lord said;</p>
<p><em>And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hyrum responded to every need and request from his younger brother, Joseph. Though Hyrum did not have the spiritual witnesses of Oliver he spent his time moving forward the work of the church. He preached the gospel through several missions, recruited members for Zion&rsquo;s camp, when the Kirtland Temple was announced he immediately took his scythe and cleared the weeds and began digging the temple&rsquo;s foundation. He served as an Assistant President of the Church and served under his younger brothers, the Prophet Joseph. President Faust said, &ldquo;He was ever a source of strength and comfort to his brother, whether in Church service or in the Liberty Jail. As persecutions came and Joseph fled the mob at Nauvoo in 1844, Hyrum went with him&hellip;.[In] Carthage&hellip;they died as martyrs within minutes of one another. Hyrum had been faithful to his trust even to the laying down of his life. In all respects he was a disciple of the Savior&rdquo; (James E. Faust, &ldquo;&lsquo;Some Great Thing&rsquo;, <em>Liahona</em>, Jan 2002, 53&ndash;56).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oliver forgot, but eventually remembered but lost his exalted place in the church. Hyrum never forgot who and what he was and become a martyred witness for the truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last and most powerful resource to help us remember is our Savior, Jesus Christ. Consider the experience of Alma (see Alma 36:12&ndash;16). After contemplating his many sins, and his moments of weakness, he remembered the words his father had spoken:</p>
<p>"<em>And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more." (Alma 36: 17-19)</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting as Alma remembered the counsel of his father and turned <em>wholeheartedly</em> to Christ, he found that he could &ldquo;remember my pains no more&rdquo; and in verse 21 found there was &ldquo;nothing so exquisite and sweet as was [his] joy&rdquo; (Alma 36:21). This same joy awaits each of us as we yield ourselves to the &ldquo;enticings of the Holy Spirit, and [put] off the natural man&rdquo; (Mosiah 3:19).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Marlin K. Jensen said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If we pay close attention to the uses of the word remember in the holy scriptures, we will recognize that remembering in the way God intends is a fundamental and saving principle of the gospel. This is so because prophetic admonitions to remember are frequently calls to action: to listen, to see, to do, to obey, to repent. When we remember in God&rsquo;s way, we overcome our human tendency simply to gird for the battle of life and actually engage in the battle itself, doing all in our power to resist temptation and avoid sinning&rdquo; (emphasis added &ldquo;Remember and Perish Not,&rdquo; Ensign, May 2007, 36&ndash;38).</em></p>
<p>In Helaman 12 (starting with verse 5) Helaman tells them to remember the words of King Benjamin, and the Savior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"For they remembered the words which their father Helaman spake unto them. And these are the words which he spake."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Now he tells them their names were chosen to help them remember:</p>
<p><em>"Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first </em><em>parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"O remember, remember, my sons, the words which King Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall." </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman taught to his sons&hellip;"</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"And they did remember his words; and therefore they went forth, keeping the commandments of God..." (Helaman 12: 9, 12-14)</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>By remembering the rock our Redeemer and taking advantage of his atonement we have enabling power to accomplish all things and keep the promises that we made long ago. Keeping these promises along with the enabling power of the atonement will help us so that our lives may reflect our Saviors will so that we may return with honor, full of joy and happiness beyond our understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe, coming unto Christ and being perfected in Him is, the ultimate purpose of all remembering. The Lord has given us scriptures, covenants, righteous examples, and ultimately our Savior, to help us remember. The man in prison forgot who he was and forgot his Savior and fell away. If we but remember we will not fall away. Oliver temporarily forgot but finally remembered. Hyrum never forgot&mdash;always remembered and is an example to us of one who always knew who he was.&nbsp; Through this song, by Newell Dayley, I would like to share my testimony of the role of the Savior in leading us home. I want to thank my daughter, Amy Sadler, for accompanying me today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, by remembering who and what we are we may find our lives used in serving Him and His light will be a constant, guiding star to lead us to his eternal glory, which is our divine purpose. &nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of my favorite scriptures about BYU&ndash;Idaho is found in Doctrine and Covenants 97. It is a beautiful passage of scripture about the school in Zion. &nbsp;Speaking about those who are part of the school in Zion, the Lord says,</p>
<p>"Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice &ndash; yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command &ndash; they are accepted of me."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit." <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the Lord has brought you here. &nbsp;I know you have followed the whisperings of the Spirit by coming here. &nbsp;I know for many of you, if not all of you, it has required great personal sacrifice. &nbsp;I know there are things you do every day, every week that involve sacrifice. &nbsp;I want you to know that I know your sacrifice is accepted of the Lord. &nbsp;I know that in your private moments, in your prayers, and in the time you spend communing with the Holy Ghost, that the Lord will tell you that personally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for some reason, I have been impressed today to tell you that I have felt that your sacrifice is accepted of the Lord; that if you continue in humility and faith you will be the people He describes in this scripture. &nbsp;He will cause you to bring forth as a very fruitful tree, not only in your professional life, but also your personal life and the lives of those you love. &nbsp;He will bless you and be with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to renew an invitation I have extended to you before to do a few things on a regular basis in your classes. &nbsp;First, begin every class with prayer. &nbsp;We should take the opportunity to invite the Holy Ghost to come, to participate, and to teach. &nbsp;Second, I encourage you to set a good example for your students in your lives, in how you dress, and in how you carry yourselves. &nbsp;Third, be bold enough and brave enough to talk with a student you see is struggling. &nbsp;If you see evidence of disobedience on their part &ndash; perhaps they come to class dressed inappropriately or you can tell by their demeanor that something is wrong &ndash; I hope you will take action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Express a concern to them, probably privately. &nbsp;Ask them to consider what they are doing, invite them to make needed changes, and promise them blessings. &nbsp;That is the framework for having such a discussion: teach true doctrine about covenants and keeping commitments, invite them to act, and promise them the blessings of the Lord. &nbsp;Doing those things will be a great blessing to them.</p>
<p>In that same spirit, I also want to share with you something I have learned about teaching and the Lord&rsquo;s work in this university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When we teach, we are doing the Lord&rsquo;s work, no matter what we are teaching. &nbsp;Whenever we seek to help someone develop new understanding, we influence that person&rsquo;s life for good. &nbsp;In your teaching, you have access to the powers of heaven, and in particular, you have access to the pure love of Christ. &nbsp;I believe that if you act in faith, Christ will bless you and your students. &nbsp;You will see and feel the pure love of Christ in your classes and in your work with your students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three gifts that will come to you as you act in faith, and as you love and care about your students, as I know you do. &nbsp;First, we are blessed to feel what the Savior feels for these great young people. &nbsp;You will feel what He feels. Second, the Spirit will carry your words and actions into the hearts of your students. &nbsp;Those words and actions will be just what is needed in that moment. &nbsp;Third, you will be able to see the Lord working through you to bless them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first gift, to feel what the Lord feels, is a gift of the spirit. &nbsp;It may be just a glimpse or a faint impression, but you will feel what He feels for those young people. &nbsp;That will create in you feelings of empathy and understanding, and it will motivate you to action. &nbsp;I know all of you have been students and can remember what it is like. &nbsp;Especially for students who are new, you know how much fear, worry, and concern is in their hearts. &nbsp;God will bless you to feel what He feels for them. &nbsp;He knows them and loves them. &nbsp;You will have that as a gift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second gift is that He will help you say just what is needed for each of those students. &nbsp;It is a marvelous blessing that comes because the Holy Ghost ministers in your classroom. &nbsp;The hours you spend in preparation, the years of devoted study, the prayers you offer, your faith and devotion &ndash; they are like an offering that God will tailor to the needs of those students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Book of Moses, when the Lord calls Enoch to be a prophet, Enoch says, &ldquo;wherefore am I thy servant?&rdquo; <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The Lord responds,</p>
<p>"Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. &nbsp;Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance..."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes the reason you say and teach what you do, or interact in the way you do, is that the Lord has blessed you to know what to say or do or teach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, the Lord tells Enoch,</p>
<p>"Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore, all thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; therefore walk with me." <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you work, prepare, and do your very best with a good heart, the Lord&rsquo;s spirit will be with you. &nbsp;He takes what you say and He justifies it. &nbsp;He makes it great &ndash; just right for the students. &nbsp;It is a gift that will be yours because of your faith and devotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last gift is to see the Lord work through you. &nbsp;I know there are many testimonies you could give about that gift because you have seen it. &nbsp;It is a gift to see the Lord working through you to touch the lives of these wonderful young people. &nbsp;It comes because of God&rsquo;s love for them, His love for you, and your faith and devotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to commend to you the third chapter of Ephesians and a passage in which Paul offers what is essentially a prayer about love, God&rsquo;s power, and our work together.</p>
<p>"For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God." <sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, I love you very much. &nbsp;I thank the Lord for the opportunity to serve with you. &nbsp;I pray that His blessing will be upon you, not just this semester but always, every day, now and forever. &nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, I am happy to be with you on another great day at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; It is a joy to welcome you to a new semester.&nbsp; Sister Clark and I love you very much.&nbsp; I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us today that you and I may learn what the Lord would have us do to strengthen the spirit of gratitude in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to begin today with a personal story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Pitchfork</strong></p>
<p>When I was a boy, I loved to visit my grandparents in Cannonville, Utah.&nbsp; They had a farm there, and I loved to ride the horses and the tractors and play in the barn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On one visit<ins datetime="2010-09-08T14:50" cite="mailto:Kathy%20Webb">,</ins> when I was about 9 years old, I was playing in the barn just before supper.&nbsp; I saw an old pitchfork standing against the wall next to a few bales of hay.&nbsp; I grabbed that pitchfork and jammed it into the hay again and again, just like I had seen my grandpa do.&nbsp; I wanted to get more leverage and more power, so I braced my left foot on one of the bales.&nbsp; I lifted up the pitchfork as high as I could; and then, forgetting that my foot was in there, I stuck it down into the hay with everything I had.&nbsp; That pitchfork went through the hay, through the top of my black canvas sneakers, and right into my foot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>O, that hurt!&nbsp; But I was so embarrassed I went right into dinner and didn&rsquo;t say a word to anyone about my injury.&nbsp; In fact, I didn&rsquo;t say anything to anyone about it for a couple of days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, you can imagine the kind of pathogens that lived on that old, rusty, heavily used barnyard pitchfork.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t think about those germs at all.&nbsp; I looked at my foot, and all I saw was a little puncture wound.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to tell anyone about the stupid thing I had done, so I said not a word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My leg started to hurt the next day.&nbsp; At first it just felt like a pulled muscle, and I hid it pretty well.&nbsp; But the second day was much worse.&nbsp; My friends and I went swimming in our favorite pond that second morning.&nbsp; As soon as I put my left foot into the cold pond water, the pain shot up my leg.&nbsp; I was miserable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to hide the pain, but my Dad saw me limping around and came over to find out what was wrong.&nbsp; I told him what happened in the barn two days before, and he immediately put me in the car and hurried to the hospital in Panguitch.&nbsp; When we got there, the doctor took one look at my foot and leg and said:&nbsp; &ldquo;It looks like tetanus.&nbsp; You are lucky your Dad brought you in when he did.&nbsp; Any longer and this would have been really, really bad.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The doctor disappeared for a moment and then returned with the biggest needle and syringe I had ever seen.&nbsp; He shot a large amount of penicillin into my left arm; it really hurt.&nbsp; My arm went stiff and I couldn&rsquo;t lift it without pain for two weeks.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s what it took to kill the poison.&nbsp; And it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I walked into that hospital, there was poison in my foot and leg, poison that had begun to spread.&nbsp; If I had waited a few hours longer, my life would have been in danger.&nbsp; But the penicillin attacked the poisonous bacteria and worked with my own immune system to rid my body of that terrible threat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When physical poisons enter the body, they disrupt the body&rsquo;s systems and organs and can cause illness and even death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also spiritual poisons that disrupt our capacity to discern spiritual feelings and impressions.&nbsp; In their most advanced and virulent forms, spiritual poisons cause the afflicted to &ldquo;die as to things pertaining unto righteousness.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many kinds of spiritual poisons.&nbsp; Today, I would like to talk about a spiritual poison that hardens the heart and deadens the soul.&nbsp; I speak today of the spirit of entitlement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four years ago Elder David A. Bednar stood at this pulpit and warned us about the spirit of entitlement at BYU-Idaho and gave us a powerful promise:</p>
<p><em>In the authority of the holy Apostleship, I now raise a voice of warning and I make a solemn promise.&nbsp; If the day ever were to come that intellectual arrogance, a lack of appreciation, and a spirit of demanding entitlement take root on this campus&mdash;among the students, the faculty, the employees, the administration, or within the community of Rexburg&mdash;then in that day the Spirit of Ricks will be well on the way to being extinguished&mdash;and the heavenly influence and blessings that have prospered this institution and the people associated with it will be withdrawn.&nbsp; Conversely, as long as intellectual modesty, humility, gratitude, obedience, and frugality continue to characterize those who learn and serve at Brigham Young University-Idaho, then this university will shine forth ever brighter as a beacon of righteousness and of inspired educational innovation.</em><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I know that our student body is full of young people who are humble and faithful and grateful to be here.&nbsp; I know that our faculty and staff are full of men and women who love the Lord and have consecrated their lives to His work.&nbsp; But we live in a society awash in the poisonous spirit of entitlement.&nbsp; All of us need to be aware of, prepared for, and protected against the awful effects of this deadly poison.&nbsp; As I speak today, please keep in mind my experience with the pitchfork.&nbsp; There are many parallels between the poison that infected my leg and the spiritual poison that endangers our souls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Poison of the Spirit of Entitlement</strong></p>
<p>If you and I have the spirit of entitlement, it means we have an attitude and belief that the world <em>owes</em> us what we want.&nbsp; Like Laman and Lemuel, some who harbor the spirit of entitlement believe they have been shortchanged in life or aggrieved in some way and that they deserve more than they are getting.&nbsp; Often those who succumb to the spirit of entitlement feel superior to those around them, or believe certain rules should not apply to them, or that they should not be required to do what everyone else has to do.&nbsp; They believe they are entitled to special treatment and special privileges.&nbsp; They want something for nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The spirit of entitlement has a history that goes back to the War in Heaven.&nbsp; Satan was full of pride and the spirit of entitlement when he rebelled and fought against the Father and the Son.&nbsp; He said to God, &ldquo;I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.&rdquo;<sup>3&nbsp;</sup> Jesus, in contrast, said simply, &ldquo;Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the law of heaven that &ldquo;when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; But the blessing comes in God&rsquo;s &ldquo;own time, and in his own way.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; Not only was Satan&rsquo;s proposal contrary to God&rsquo;s law and plan, but he demanded the blessing of God&rsquo;s honor.&nbsp; Where Jesus was humble and submissive to the Father&rsquo;s will, Satan was proud and entitled.&nbsp; Satan embraced the demanding spirit of entitlement in the pre-mortal realm and was &ldquo;cast down.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp; Now he seeks to infect us with its deadly poison.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That infection often begins with small and simple feelings we might each encounter under certain circumstances; for example, a brother who was absent for several classes in the semester but claimed he should be treated differently because he was the head of a campus organization; or a sister who felt she had a right to an A in a class just because she had turned in all the assignments; or a brother who believed he had a right to park next to every classroom building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the poison that was in my leg, if we do not recognize these feelings early and stop their effects, the spirit of entitlement can be deadly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The spirit of entitlement is a poison that works on the spiritual heart.&nbsp; Our heart contains our deepest desires and commitments and our character and our will.&nbsp; It is to and in our heart that the Lord communicates spiritual truth and divine guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of your spiritual heart full of receptors and sensors tuned to the Holy Ghost with capacity to receive the gifts of the Spirit.&nbsp; Imagine that righteous desires and the doctrines of salvation have found a place in your heart.&nbsp; Now think of the poison of the spirit of entitlement seeping into your heart, working its way into those delicate and soft receptors and sensors.&nbsp; Think of the poison twisting and shrinking your righteous desires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you see in your mind&rsquo;s eye the poison wounding and scarring your heart, making it tough and insensitive?&nbsp; This is what the prophets call a hard heart.&nbsp; As our hearts harden, the spirit of entitlement gives license to the desires of the natural man.&nbsp; It rationalizes sin and opens up a place in our heart for unrighteousness.&nbsp; For example, if the spirit of entitlement leads us to believe that we have already put in more than our fair share of service, we may decide to shirk our responsibility to home teach or visit teach.&nbsp; Or, we may justify plagiarizing a paper with the thought that we simply are getting what is our due.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the spirit of entitlement gets into our hearts, we become overly concerned with measures of material success and preoccupied with indicators of rank and privilege.&nbsp; Greed creeps in, and we develop an attitude that we deserve to have our worldly wants and the desires of the natural man satisfied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Elder Dallin H. Oaks has warned:</p>
<p><em>The ancient evil of greed shows its face in the assertion of entitlement:&nbsp; I am entitled to this or that because of who I am&mdash;a son or a daughter, a citizen, a victim, or a member of some other group.&nbsp; Entitlement is generally selfish.&nbsp; It demands much, and it gives little or nothing.<sup>8</sup></em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The scriptures warn us repeatedly that the spirit of entitlement leads us to anger and to fight against God and His eternal plan.&nbsp; In the Old Testament, for example, we have the story of Naaman, the Syrian captain who was afflicted with leprosy.&nbsp; He came to Elisha the prophet to be healed, but he came with a spirit of entitlement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</p>
<p><em>And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and </em><em>wash</em><em> in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be </em><em>clean</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The spirit of entitlement blinded Naaman.&nbsp; Believing that he was entitled to privileged treatment and a more noble remedy, he became angry when Elisha did not meet him.&nbsp; Because of his anger, he almost lost the opportunity to be healed.&nbsp; Fortunately, his servants persuaded him to humble himself and go to the Jordan.&nbsp; He went and was healed.&nbsp; When a humbled, grateful Naaman returned to Elisha, the prophet met him and blessed him.&nbsp; Naaman not only was healed of the leprosy, but his heart was healed as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we may feel and act like Naaman before he was healed. &nbsp;We may feel entitled to more than we are getting or to special treatment, and we may bristle at people who don&rsquo;t give us what we want.&nbsp; Our hearts may grow hard, and we may chafe at requirements and harbor feelings of rebellion against authority, even against God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this happens, we are on our way to becoming like the people the Lord described in the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p>They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god.&rdquo;<sup>10&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, this is what the spirit of entitlement is and what it does.&nbsp; It separates us from God and makes us forget the Savior and our dependence on His mercy and grace.&nbsp; It is a deadly spiritual poison.&nbsp; But we can be like Naaman after he washed himself in the Jordan seven times.&nbsp; If we will turn to God, humble ourselves, and repent, the Lord Jesus Christ will take away the poison and heal and change our hearts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like physical pain and swelling, there are warning signs of the spirit of entitlement.&nbsp; And so, we need to search our hearts to see if we find any sign of the spirit of entitlement there.&nbsp; Here are some questions that may help in the search:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answers to these questions could be early warning signs that the spirit of entitlement is at work.&nbsp; If you or I ever feel these things or hear these things in our minds, we should not be like the little boy with the pitchfork wound in his foot.&nbsp; We should not foolishly wait for the poison to work.&nbsp; We should act in faith in Christ and repent&mdash;turn away from the spirit of entitlement and turn to the healing, redeeming power of the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Healing Power of Christ</strong></p>
<p>The process of healing and redemption is described in Matthew, chapter 11, verses 28-30:</p>
<p><em>Come</em><em> unto me, all ye that </em><em>labour</em><em> and are heavy laden, and I will give you&nbsp;</em><em>rest</em><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Take my </em><em>yoke</em><em> upon you, and </em><em>learn</em><em> of me; for I am </em><em>meek</em><em> and </em><em>lowly</em><em> in </em><em>heart</em><em>: and ye shall find </em><em>rest</em><em> unto your souls.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</em><sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the image of the yoke.&nbsp; We come to Him and put our burdened hearts in His hands.&nbsp; We confess our sins and our weaknesses and seek His forgiveness and His healing power.&nbsp; He offers us His yoke&mdash;His name, His covenants, and His will.&nbsp; We take His yoke upon us and learn of Him by honoring His holy name, keeping His covenants, and doing His will.&nbsp; We stay yoked to Him by surrendering our hearts and submitting to His will through all the trials and tests of mortal probation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we come to the Savior, repent of our sins, and take upon us His yoke, we open our hearts to the sanctifying, healing power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; The poison stops and the change and healing starts when we give our hearts to the Lord.&nbsp; The change we need may be difficult.&nbsp; It may be like the medicine in my arm; it may hurt.&nbsp; It may take time.&nbsp; We may need to forsake sin and overcome addiction.&nbsp; We may need new attitudes.&nbsp; We may need new capacity for patience and kindness.&nbsp; But His promises are sure:&nbsp; if we stay yoked to Him, He will change our hearts, we will find &ldquo;rest [to our] souls,&rdquo;<sup>12</sup> and He will protect us from the spirit of entitlement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude:&nbsp; The Great Protection Against the Spirit of Entitlement</strong></p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell has given us a key to obtaining that divine protection:</p>
<p><em>The lowly do not make high demands of life, though they have a high desire to serve.&nbsp; They are not drenched in an exaggerated sense of entitlement, but instead are drenched in gratitude over the marvelous basic blessings they have even in the midst of the disappointments of the day.&rdquo;</em><sup>13</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, gratitude is the great antidote, the great protection against the spirit of entitlement.&nbsp; What we need is deep gratitude for the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; We need to be drenched in gratitude for Him so that we &ldquo;confess . . . his hand in all things&rdquo;<sup>14</sup> and &ldquo;live in thanksgiving daily for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon [us].&rdquo; <sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to close by suggesting three things we can do to engender a spirit of gratitude in our lives:&nbsp; pray with real intent, partake of the sacrament with our hearts and minds focused on the Savior, and worship in the temple with thanksgiving. &nbsp;These are gifts from the Savior. &nbsp;He has created them for us and taught us how to use them. &nbsp;They are opportunities to help us always remember Him and express our love and gratitude for Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Prayer</strong></p>
<p>When we humbly kneel in prayer, we approach the Father in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, totally dependent on the Savior&rsquo;s merits, mercy, and grace.&nbsp; Prayer is an opportunity to remember what the Savior has done for us and to thank our Heavenly Father for specific blessings we have received.&nbsp; Prayer is also an opportunity to ask the Father to bless us with the spirit of gratitude.&nbsp; If we remember our Redeemer and clearly express our love and appreciation for Him in our prayers, feelings of gratitude will well up in us through the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; When we pray in this way, everything we say in our prayers, including our humble petitions to the Throne of Grace, will be tinged with gratitude.&nbsp; That will not happen if our prayers are casual or routine.&nbsp; But if we pray morning and night in humility and faith with real intent, God will answer our prayers and the spirit of gratitude will grow in us through our prayers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. &nbsp;The Sacrament</strong></p>
<p>Each Sunday when we take the sacrament bread and water, we have the opportunity to remember the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; It is a time to remember Him, to witness our willingness to take His name upon us, and to renew the covenants we have made with Him and with our Father in Heaven.&nbsp; It is a time to feel gratitude for the Atonement, its power in our lives, and the blessings and strength that are in the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; If we partake of the sacrament with our hearts and minds focused on the Savior, the Spirit will &ldquo;tell [us] in [our hearts]&rdquo; <sup>16</sup>&nbsp;what the Lord wants us to do.&nbsp; As we listen and commit to act, the yoke of Christ will feel good to us, and we will rejoice in gratitude for the mercy and grace of the Savior.&nbsp; The sacrament is a time for the spirit of gratitude to grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. &nbsp;The Temple</strong></p>
<p>The temple is the house of the Lord.&nbsp; When we enter the temple, we enter into the presence of the Lord.&nbsp; The temple experience is both inspiring and humbling.&nbsp; We feel the majesty and power of God, and we receive supernal blessings.&nbsp; And we see and feel through the power of the Spirit that all of these things come to us because of the sacrifice of the Son of God.</p>
<p>Of temples, President Gordon B. Hinckley declared,</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;These unique and wonderful buildings, and the ordinances administered therein, represent the ultimate in our worship.&rdquo;</em><sup>17</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every ordinance, every covenant we make in the temple is an opportunity to express our love and reverence for the Father and the Son and our devotion and allegiance to Them.&nbsp; If we faithfully and consistently worship in the temple, the temple truly will be &ldquo;a place of thanksgiving&rdquo; <sup>18</sup> as the Lord commanded.&nbsp; He will bless us with His protection and power, and our gratitude for Him and His atoning sacrifice will grow.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If we pursue these three sacred opportunities with full purpose of heart, we will have the spirit of gratitude in our lives and we will be protected from the spirit of entitlement.&nbsp; We will feel like and be like the people at the temple at Bountiful when the Savior appeared to them.&nbsp; For just a moment, imagine what that scene must have been like.&nbsp; Imagine Jesus descending with power and glory, declaring His divine identity as the Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp; Imagine coming unto Him one-by-one and feeling His hands, His side, and His feet.&nbsp; Now listen carefully to what happened next:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:</p>
<p><em>Hosanna!&nbsp; Blessed be the name of the Most High God!&nbsp; And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.</em> <sup>19</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later after He had taught them, Jesus invited all those &ldquo;afflicted in any manner&rdquo; <sup>20</sup>&nbsp;to come to Him.&nbsp; And they came and &ldquo;he did heal them every one.&rdquo;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp; Then the scripture says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they did all, both they who had been healed and they who were whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him . . . .<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I pray this will be our personal experience.&nbsp; It is my hope that in our prayers, in the sacrament, and in the house of the Lord, we, too, will feel that same joyous gratitude for the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such a spirit of gratitude will be a great blessing to each one of us.&nbsp; Everything about our lives will be better.&nbsp; There will be more joy, happiness, and peace in our families, in our work, in our studies, and in our relationships.&nbsp; And we will keep the spirit of entitlement and its deadly poison out of our lives and out of this university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the words of Elder Bednar, we will learn and serve together with a spirit of &ldquo;modesty, humility, gratitude, obedience, and frugality&rdquo; <sup>23</sup>&nbsp;and &ldquo;this university will shine forth ever brighter as a beacon of righteousness and of inspired educational innovation.&rdquo; <sup>24</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, brothers and sisters, remember the little boy and the pitchfork; and don&rsquo;t let the spirit of entitlement into your heart.&nbsp; Come unto Christ.&nbsp; He is the Living Son of the Living God. I bear witness of Him.&nbsp; He is the Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp; I know from my own experience of His redeeming love and healing power.&nbsp; I am grateful for Him.&nbsp; I pray that you will give your heart to Him, take His yoke upon you, and &ldquo;live in thanksgiving daily.&rdquo; <sup>25</sup>&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I want to take just a couple of minutes this afternoon to give you some words of encouragement at the start of this new semester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark and I often get questions from students regarding the Spirit and how to effectively use the guidance of the Holy Ghost in our lives.&nbsp; All of us seek to feel the sustaining power of the Holy Ghost when we are making big decisions or seeking specific blessings; but it is also the case that we can have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost and know that we have the guidance of the Spirit in everything we do!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In D&amp;C 121 we read these words of revelation:</p>
<p><em>"And let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven"</em></p>
<p><em>"[And] the Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion."</em><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Bednar once answered a student&rsquo;s question in home evening about how to get guidance from the Spirit by saying that you just have to &ldquo;be good&mdash;live the commandments and be good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April conference of 1990, Elder Wirthlin taught:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"When we are doing what is right, we will not feel timid and hesitant about seeking divine direction.&nbsp; We will know the Lord will answer our prayers and help us in our need."</em><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People who do what is right have integrity.&nbsp; They do what they say they will do.&nbsp; They live the standards they have committed to live and are firm in keeping covenants they have made. &nbsp;That is why Elder Bednar could say to a student at BYU-Idaho:&nbsp; &ldquo;just be good, keep the commandments, and the Spirit will guide you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all have the opportunity to live lives of integrity, lives of personal honor. &nbsp;To live a life of personal honor, we must be true at all times. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to read to you part of an e-mail President Clark received from a student recently.&nbsp; This student was at work at a business here in Rexburg and was approached by a Bureau of Land Management employee.&nbsp; The following conversation took place between the BLM employee and the student: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>"I have a question--Are you a student at the University?" I told him I was, and then he seriously asked, "What is a typical student like there?" I wasn't sure what he was getting at, so I paused to think how to answer him. &nbsp;He then explained that he had had to kick out a group of about 50 students who had built a bon fire in the wrong part of the sand dunes. &nbsp;He told me with slight awe that not one of them yelled or swore at him or made any sort of fuss (apparently that's what usually happens to him when he tells people they have to leave a place where they shouldn't be). &nbsp;They [the students] quickly obeyed and promptly put out their bon fire. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I told him that experience pretty much describes BYU-Idaho students--they probably just felt REALLY bad. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>He said that was exactly the impression he'd gotten. &nbsp;I could tell this man had been quite impacted by this experience. &nbsp;It seemed like he couldn't shake off how honest and simply nice the students had been.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I felt proud to be a BYU-I student, that's for sure. &nbsp;What if those students HAD been rude? &nbsp;What kind of impact would they have had on the man then?</em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful that those students did what was right.&nbsp; They were true at all times.&nbsp; They had integrity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Faust said:</p>
<p><em>"Integrity can be defined as a firm adherence to a code of moral values . . . and is the light that shines from a disciplined conscience.&nbsp; It is the strength of duty within us."</em><sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great blessing of a life of integrity is the companionship of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Elder Wirthlin taught:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"[A] reward of integrity is the confidence it can give us in approaching God.&nbsp; When virtue garnishes our thoughts unceasingly, our confidence is strong in the presence of God."&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"The consummate reward of integrity is the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost does not attend us when we do evil.&nbsp; But when we do what is right, he can dwell with us and guide us in all we do."<sup>5</sup></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful for these promised blessings.&nbsp; I am also grateful for the Spirit we feel on this campus because each of us seeks to be true at all times and to live lives of personal honor.&nbsp; Living lives of personal honor provides protection and is a preparation for the future.&nbsp; May we all seek to have integrity in our actions every day so that we can have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ,&nbsp;amen</p>

<p>I know enough about you and the circumstances that bring you here that I feel very humble and grateful to be with you today. I also appreciate your preparation for today&rsquo;s devotional. That preparation constitutes a wonderful invitation to the Spirit to be with us, for which I also have prayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have entitled my remarks &ldquo;As Ye Are Agents.&rdquo; When we hear the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in the scriptures, we typically think of what some call &ldquo;free agency,&rdquo; or more correctly, &ldquo;moral agency&rdquo;&mdash;our God-given gift of freedom to make choices. But there is another very important meaning. Of the twenty-two times the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; or &ldquo;agency&rdquo; is used in the scriptures, only six refer to moral agency. The other sixteen refer to &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in the context of being a representative of the Lord, as in Doctrine and Covenants section 64 verse 29:</p>
<p><em>"Wherefore, as ye are agents, ye are on the Lord's errand; and whatever ye do according to the will of the Lord is the Lord's business."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I have come to believe that only as we understand this dimension of &ldquo;agency,&rdquo; can we truly understand the other dimension of &ldquo;moral agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now why might this understanding be important for you? For many reasons. I will mention just a few. Most of you are at a time in your life when you are making significant decisions, like whom to date, whom to marry and when, where to live when you graduate, what to major in, and what to do to earn a living. Also you are dealing with issues such as how to look forward in faith in a world that seems to be increasingly dangerous and unstable.&nbsp; When you see problems in the world, in marriages and in the economy, you may even feel anxious about the possibility that you may not be able to experience some of the things you have dreamed of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may wonder what the idea of being an agent on the Lord&rsquo;s errand has to do with these issues. I hope you are wondering because wonder is often a prelude to learning. I can tell you now that this principle can totally change how you feel about your life and your choices. I suggest that it will not only influence your choices but, more specifically, <em>why</em> you make the choices you make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Two &ldquo;Agents&rdquo; of the Lord</strong></p>
<p>It is a unique experience to serve as a general officer in the Church&mdash;one for which I will be forever grateful. In visiting with friends now, I am often asked what was it like, and what did I learn from that experience. I will share with you a little about my experience in the next few minutes, but I will say now that at the top of the list of learnings was this principle of being an agent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me invite you to use your imagination for a few moments. Suppose that some day in the future, you find yourself living in a place where some people have become antagonistic toward you because of your religion.&nbsp; You are constantly being dragged into court on trumped-up charges and frivolous law suits and ridiculed and slandered in the local media, and you have real reason to believe that your life is in danger. Suppose, too, that you have a significant amount of property in your name, and from doing business and defending yourself in the courts, you have acquired a lot of debt. You must leave, but if you just slip away without dealing with your obligations, you know it would be wrong and it would provide even more ammunition for those who are attacking the Church. So you must select someone who can serve as an agent to legally represent you in resolving your affairs. Whom would you choose? How would you make that decision?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now suppose, on the other hand, that you were the person chosen as the agent to resolve all these issues for someone else. How would you feel? What would you do? Would you even accept? Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was actually the situation when Joseph Smith was forced to leave Kirtland, Ohio in 1838 and Oliver Granger was appointed by revelation to be his agent. Oliver worked at this almost impossible assignment so well that John W. Hawden (one of his creditors, who was not a member of the Church) wrote the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"[T]he closing up of my business with said society has been with their agent, Colonel Granger, appointed by them for that purpose; and I consider it highly due Colonel Granger from me, here to state that he has acted truly and honestly in all his business with me, and has accomplished more than I could reasonably have expected." </em>(HC, vol. 3, p. 174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you and I don&rsquo;t hear much today about Oliver Granger, but in addition to the fact that his name has been memorialized in the Doctrine and Covenants, we know that by the time he joined the Church in 1830 he had lost most of his eyesight &ldquo;due to extreme cold.&rdquo; However, he had still been able to perform his duties as a sheriff in New York and to serve as a colonel in the New York militia and a licensed exhorter in the Methodist church before he was converted through a very direct witness of the Book of Mormon. Whatever mortal weaknesses Oliver may have had, from all indication he was very faithful and effective as an agent for Joseph and the First Presidency of the Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God places great value on being a trusted agent. Consider the words the Lord used to describe Brother Granger as he faced this seemingly impossible task.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"And again, I say unto you, I remember my servant Oliver Granger; behold, verily I say unto him that his name shall be had in sacred remembrance from generation to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"Therefore, let him contend earnestly for the redemption of the First Presidency of my Church, saith the Lord; and when he falls he shall rise again, for his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase, saith the Lord." </em>(D&amp;C<em> </em>117:12-13)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In these verses, the &ldquo;redemption of the First Presidency&rdquo;<em> </em>means the resolution of their financial obligations<em>.</em> &ldquo;When he falls he shall rise again&rdquo; implies that Oliver would have some failures; yet if he would not give up and would keep trying, his faithful effort would be recognized by the Lord as more sacred than his success, for as the Lord said, &ldquo;his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How would you like to live so that our Father in Heaven would say of you what he said of Oliver Granger? Oliver Granger was an &ldquo;agent&rdquo;&mdash;an agent of the Lord and His Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let me tell you about another &ldquo;agent&rdquo; by sharing an experience I had some years ago with Brother J. Thomas Fyans, who later became a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. At the time, Brother Fyans was not a general authority but was serving as an administrative director in the Office of the Presiding Bishop. I was invited to a meeting where the Presiding Bishop, Victor L. Brown, was to speak, but at the last minute he had been called away and had asked Brother Fyans to give the talk in his place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bishop Brown and Brother Fyans were both very fine speakers, but they were quite different in their speaking style. At the meeting, Brother Fyans gave a very helpful and inspirational talk. However, it was very different than any other talk I had ever heard him give. As I was visiting with him later, I asked him about it. His reply contained a lesson I have not forgotten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He told me that he had been there to deliver Bishop Brown&rsquo;s message. As I thought about his reply, I realized that Brother Fyans had taken the bishop&rsquo;s notes and had done his best to deliver the message that the bishop would have delivered in the way he would have delivered it&mdash;not just in words, but in spirit. Brother Fyans did not read the talk (as I recall, it was not written out), but he used the knowledge he had of Bishop Brown and his priorities and gave his whole heart to the effort of communicating the content and intent of what he felt the bishop wanted communicated. He had no ego invested. He was not there to &ldquo;do his own thing.&rdquo; Just as Oliver Granger had acted as an &ldquo;agent&rdquo; of the Prophet Joseph over a hundred and fifty years earlier, Elder Fyans acted as an agent of Bishop Brown, as well as the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The Teacher&rsquo;s Divine Commission&rdquo; as an Agent of the Lord</strong></p>
<p>In 1977, Elder Bruce R. McConkie gave a classic talk entitled &ldquo;The Teacher&rsquo;s Divine Commission,&rdquo; which explains how this principle applies to teachers in the Church. This talk is printed in the manual <em>Teaching No Greater Call</em>. Elder McConkie said in part:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>In all our teaching we represent the Lord and are appointed to teach His gospel. We are the Lord&rsquo;s agents, and as such we are empowered to say only those things which He wants said.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Agents represent their principal. They have no power of their own. They act in someone else&rsquo;s name. They do what they are told to do. They say what they are authorized to say&mdash;nothing more, nothing less.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We are the Lord&rsquo;s agents. We represent Him. &ldquo;As ye are agents,&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;ye are on the Lord&rsquo;s errand; and whatever ye do according to the will of the Lord is the Lord&rsquo;s business&rdquo; (</em><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/64/29#29" target="contentWindow"><em>D&amp;C 64:29</em></a><em>).</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Our business as teachers is to teach His doctrine and none other. There is no other course we can follow if we are to save souls. We have no saving power of our own. We cannot create a law or a doctrine that will redeem or resurrect or save another person. The Lord only can do these things, and we are appointed to teach what He reveals on these and all gospel doctrines. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me give you a simple but profound example of how one teacher applied this principle in her classroom. One day while I was serving in the general Sunday School, a sister approached me with a question. She told me she was serving as a gospel doctrine teacher in her ward, and she was feeling a bit discouraged. There was a brother in her class who was always asking questions that seemed to be off-topic and were diverting and distracting. She found herself often getting frustrated with this brother, which was not helpful to her efforts to have the Spirit with her in her teaching. As we discussed the situation, I suggested to her that she re-read Elder McConkie&rsquo;s talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next time I saw her, she was excited and smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;That talk you suggested touched me deeply,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;As I read Elder McConkie&rsquo;s words, I realized that I needed to see my role as a teacher from an entirely different perspective. The reason this man bothered me was because I had been looking at his interruptions as efforts to distract me and pull me away from <em>my</em> teaching plan. But when I saw my role as the Lord&rsquo;s agent, I began to see this brother with different eyes and hear him with different ears. The issue was not about getting through my lesson; it was about teaching what the Lord would have taught to His children in that classroom in that moment, including this brother. It has changed the way I teach, the way I feel, and the whole spirit of the class. And it seems to have affected this brother also. I guess the truth is that he was not the one who needed to change; it was me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Crucial in Every Aspect</strong></p>
<p>This role of being an agent is crucial in every aspect of our lives and service to the Lord. Consider what is said in the Bible Dictionary under &ldquo;ministry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"The work of the ministry is to do the work of the Lord on the earth&mdash;to represent the Lord among the people, preach the gospel, and administer the ordinances thereof&hellip; A minister "called of God, as was Aaron" (Heb. 5: 4), and endowed with the holy priesthood, represents the Lord when he is performing his official duties, and is the Lord's agent. Therefore, what he does "according to the will of the Lord is the Lord's business (D&amp;C 64: 29)</em>&rdquo;<em> </em>(&ldquo;Ministry,&rdquo; Bible Dictionary, p. 732).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider how you feel about the priesthood. Do you see it solely as a blessing that enables you to do the things you want to do, such as get married for eternity, or offers help when you need it, such as when you or a loved one is seriously ill?</p>
<p>Or do you see the priesthood as President Boyd K. Packer described in his Saturday morning address at the April 2010 General Conference:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Priesthood is the authority and the power, which God has granted to men on earth to act for Him.&nbsp;When priesthood authority is exercised properly, priesthood bearers do what He would do if He were present."</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider how you feel about prayer. Is it something you do to get what you want? Or does the principle of being an agent apply here as well? According to the Bible Dictionary:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them."</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"We pray in Christ's name when our mind is the mind of Christ, and our wishes the wishes of Christ - when his words abide in us (John 15: 7). We then ask for things it is possible for God to grant. Many prayers remain unanswered because they are not in Christ's name at all; they in no way represent his mind, but spring out of the selfishness of man's heart" </em>(&ldquo;Prayer,&rdquo; Bible Dictionary, p, 753)<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Notice what it means to pray in Christ&rsquo;s name&mdash;that our mind is the mind of Christ. As the Lord teaches in the Doctrine and Covenants:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;He that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of God; wherefore it is done even as he asketh </em>(D&amp;C 46:30).</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>When planning a group activity, do you think primarily of what the others would like, what would be fun, or what would impress everyone&mdash;or do you think about what the Lord would have you do as His agent to truly bless His children?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the whole essence of being a disciple of Christ about seeking His help in doing what we want to do&mdash;or is it about doing what He would do and have us do in the situation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Three Grand Keys</strong></p>
<p>Now let me ask you this: If you were going to have someone to be your agent and to buy and sell and make commitments in your name, wouldn&rsquo;t you want someone who knew you&mdash;not someone who just some facts about you, but someone who knew your heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be an agent of God we need to seek to know the mind and heart of God&mdash;what He would want to have done and how He would want it to be done. If we know very little about the Savior and only feel the Spirit from time to time, we will have a hard time being an effective agent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore as the Lord&rsquo;s agents, we respond to His invitation.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me." </em>(D&amp;C 19:23).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do we learn of Him? The sacrament prayer gives three grand keys. Those who partake with real intent witness unto God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, that &ldquo;they are willing to take upon them the name of [His] Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first key is to be willing to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; This has to do with seeing ourselves as agents of the Lord. Years ago I left my home in California to attend BYU on a golf scholarship. I remember how excited I was when the team traveled eight hundred miles to play in our first collegiate tournament. As we met together wearing our matching team blazers with the BYU logo on the pocket, the coach said, &ldquo;Now remember, everywhere you go you will be seen as a representative of BYU and of the Church.&rdquo; I came to realize that, in effect, I had taken upon myself a new name, an expanded identity. I was no longer just Roger from California; I was now Roger from BYU, and in a very practical way I had become an agent or representative of BYU and of the Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second key we learn about in the sacrament prayer is to always remember Him. How often do we read of Him, think about Him, and ponder about His life, His mission, His eternal role? How often do we consider Him in the thoughts we think, the choices we make, the things we do? The Lord himself taught that always remembering Him is the key to having the Spirit. To the Nephites he specifically said:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you</em>." (3 Nephi 18:11)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost is the medium through whom we learn what God would have us do as His agents in any situation. How should you prepare to teach your priesthood, Relief Society or Sunday School lesson this week? How can you best work with the brother or sister you&rsquo;ve been assigned to assist with a ward activity? How do you deal with feelings of being fearful or alone? What do you say to your stepfather when he calls this week-end?&nbsp; What do you say to your brother, who doesn&rsquo;t think a mission is for him? How do you decide on a career? How do you decide on whom to marry&mdash;and when? The constant companionship and guidance of the Holy Ghost is truly a great gift, and the key to having that gift active in our lives is to always remember the Savior.</p>
<p>The third key to learning about God is to keep His commandments. As the Apostle Paul said:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are&hellip;" </em>(Romans 6:16)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, if we obey God we are His servants. If we tend to obey the rules of worldliness then we are servants of Satan, whom Paul refers to as &ldquo;the god of this world&rdquo; (2 Corinthians 4:4). We need to remember the Lord&rsquo;s words:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven." &nbsp;(Matthew 7:21)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in the simplest, most direct terms, the Lord says:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"If ye love me, keep my commandments." (John 14:15)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping the commandments is and always has been the foundation of all spiritual growth and the blessings of eternity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Highest and Best Use of Agency</strong></p>
<p>Earlier I said that the more we know about being an agent of the Lord, the more we will understand free agency or moral agency. Now let us consider some of the basic scriptural references about moral agency from Doctrine and Covenants section 29 and see if some aspects are highlighted differently in our minds as we hear these words. In verse 35, the Lord says:</p>
<p><em>"Behold, I gave unto him (meaning man) that he should be an agent unto himself&hellip; "</em></p>
<p>And in verse 36, He says:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"&hellip;for, behold, the devil was before Adam, for he rebelled against me, saying, Give me thine honor, which is my power; and also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency&hellip;"</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Notice the key phrase: &ldquo;Behold, I gave unto him that he should be &ldquo;an agent unto himself.&rdquo; In other words, we are given the gift to represent ourselves in our choices, and we will receive the results of those choices. In other words, we are both the principal and the agent. What we refer to as &ldquo;free agency&rdquo; is to be an agent unto ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what is the highest and best use of that agency? Listen reverently to these words of President Boyd K. Packer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Perhaps the greatest discovery of my life, without question the greatest commitment, came when finally I had the confidence in God that I would loan or yield my agency to him&mdash;without compulsion or pressure, without any duress, as a single individual alone, by myself, no counterfeiting, nothing expected other than the privilege. In a sense, speaking figuratively, to take one&rsquo;s agency, that precious gift which the scriptures make plain is essential to life itself, and say, &ldquo;I will do as you direct,&rdquo; is afterward to learn that in so doing you posses it all the more." </em>(&ldquo;My Greatest Discovery,&rdquo; Speeches of the Year Provo: BYU, 1971, pp. 1-7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our greatest act of moral agency is to consecrate or give our agency to God. In truth, that is the only thing we really <em>can</em> give to Him. In other words, we are given to be agents unto ourselves, and the highest and best use of that agency is to <em>choose</em> to become agents unto God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in all things, the Savior Himself set the perfect example. As he told his disciples:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me." </em>(John 6:38)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things." </em>(John 8:28)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Serving as &ldquo;Agents&rdquo; of the Lord Today</strong></p>
<p>One of the greatest blessings of my calling in the General Sunday School was the opportunity to serve with men and women who, in the similitude of the Savior, have chosen to become agents of the Lord.&nbsp; The general authorities and general officers with whom I served have become dear friends and have forever touched my life. Though they have abundant and varied talents, their hearts are unitedly about doing what the Lord would have them do. Their service is not about doing their own thing, looking good, or even making their unique contribution. It is about doing what the Lord would have done in a manner in which ego and pride are almost totally absent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course they are mortals and like all of us, they struggle more at some times than others. But their hearts are clearly set upon the things of the Lord and their example of learning, refining and course-correcting is both instructive and inspirational. My efforts to become a more useful disciple have been blessed by the humble examples of many who sought not their own will but the will of Him who sent them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the great miracles of the Church and discipleship is that it does not matter where we serve but how. While those I served with were and are marvelous examples of agents who have taken upon themselves the name of Christ, so also are tens of thousands of others in the Church throughout the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The great question for each of us is this: Have I truly taken upon myself the name of Christ? Are my heart and motives those of an agent of the Lord?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we feel what it means to be a true agent, we will place greater value on the gift of moral agency we have received. We will have a natural desire to learn more of God, and draw closer to Him. We will have a greater desire to have his Spirit to be with us. And as His spirit is more consistently with us, our gratitude and trust will grow to the point that we will have the desire to place our agency on the altar of faith that we might ever represent Him in all things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would hope and pray that each of us may use our great gift of moral agency to become agents unto the Lord, that we may say with President Monson:<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"The sweetest experience in mortality is to know that our Heavenly Father has worked through us." </em>(<em>To the Rescue</em>, p. 4)</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As we sing the closing hymn, I would ask that you please pay special attention to the words. I believe that this is a hymn of an agent of God and summarizes what I have hoped to bear witness to in this talk. I would like to read the words before we sing.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>"<em>It may not be on the mountain height</em></p>
<p><em>Or over the stormy sea,</em></p>
<p><em>It may not be at the battle's front</em></p>
<p><em>My Lord will have need of me.</em></p>
<p><em>But if, by a still, small voice he calls</em></p>
<p><em>To paths that I do not know, </em></p>
<p><em>I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine; </em></p>
<p><em>I'll go where you want me to go." </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"Perhaps today there are loving words </em></p>
<p><em>Which Jesus would have me speak </em></p>
<p><em>There may be now in the paths of sin </em></p>
<p><em>Some wand'rer whom I should seek. </em></p>
<p><em>O Savior, if thou wilt be my guide, </em></p>
<p><em>Tho dark and rugged the way, </em></p>
<p><em>My voice shall echo the message sweet;</em></p>
<p><em>I'll say what you want me to say."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"There's surely somewhere a lowly place </em></p>
<p><em>In earth's harvest fields so wide </em></p>
<p><em>Where I may labor through life's short day</em></p>
<p><em>For Jesus, the Crucified. </em></p>
<p><em>So trusting my all to thy tender care,</em></p>
<p><em>And knowing thou lovest me, â¨</em></p>
<p><em>I'll do thy will with a heart sincere: </em></p>
<p><em>I'll be what you want me to be."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>"I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,</em></p>
<p><em>Over mountain or plain or sea; </em></p>
<p><em>I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord;</em></p>
<p><em>I'll be what you want me to be."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;(&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Go Where You Want Me to Go,&rdquo; Hymns, #270)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear witness of Him whose agents we may be privileged to be, and pray that we might all so live. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Adam &amp; Eve.jpg" border="0" />&ldquo;In the beginning&rdquo;...when Adam and Eve were driven from the Garden of Eden, the Lord told Adam that he would thereafter &ldquo;eat bread in the sweat of [his] face&rdquo; (Genesis 3:19).&nbsp; Adam really had only one choice as to his life&rsquo;s work &ndash; he &ldquo;began to till the earth . . .&rdquo; we are told in Moses 5:1.&nbsp; He clearly had some challenges that you and I have not had to face.&nbsp; However, his work environment did have some advantages.&nbsp; Among others, he was able to set his own hours and approve his own sick leave and vacation time and he could not be fired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was not tempted by Jones&rsquo; law, either, &nbsp;which states that our needs are determined by what our neighbor has. Without neighbors there were no property line disputes.&nbsp; There was no coveting or jealousy, or envy, or selfishness or any of the sins that come with competition and comparison.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, Satan had very little to work with &ndash; there were very few sins with which he could tempt Adam and Eve.&nbsp; Think about it &ndash; if you were the first man or woman what could he tempt you with?&nbsp; Stealing? &ndash; no -- from whom?&nbsp; Coveting &ndash; no.&nbsp; Envy?&mdash;no.&nbsp; Gossiping? &ndash; impossible &ndash; think about it.&nbsp; Living beyond one&rsquo;s means? &ndash; also impossible.&nbsp; When you reflect on it, most serious sins involve others and would not become a possibility for Satan until the human race began to multiply and he could use competition and comparisons to appeal to the pride of men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Ezra Taft Benson.jpg" border="0" width="144" height="142" />In President Ezra Taft Benson&rsquo;s classic talk <em>Beware of Pride</em> he said that &ldquo;pride (the universal sin) is essentially competitive in nature . . .The proud make every man their adversary by pitting their intellects, opinions, works, wealth, talents, or any other worldly measuring device against others. In the words of C. S. Lewis: &lsquo;Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man. &hellip; It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest. . .&rsquo; (<em>Mere Christianity,</em> New York: Macmillan, 1952, pp. 109&ndash;10.) . . . Some prideful people are not so concerned as to whether their wages meet their needs as they are that their wages are more than someone else&rsquo;s. Their reward is being a cut above the rest. This is the enmity of pride.&rdquo; (Ezra Taft Benson, &ldquo;Beware of Pride,&rdquo; <em>Ensign</em>, May 1989, 4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The competition that Satan was so anxiously awaiting could not take place until Adam and Eve began to multiply and replenish the earth.&nbsp; When it finally did happen, it was in the work place and in the acquiring of material possessions where it occurred. It was here that he claimed Cain as his first victim as Cain fell prey to the Master Mahan principle &ldquo;that I may murder and get gain&rdquo; (Moses 5:31). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The acquiring of wealth and material possessions would become Satan&rsquo;s most fertile ground, tempting mankind with the cunning strategy that this world is our destiny and that anything and everything in this world is available for money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working in this world to make a living was part of the Lord&rsquo;s plan for His children, not just to survive, but to see how we would get along with others in making that living &ndash; to see if we would be honest in our dealings with our fellowmen.&nbsp; &nbsp;Satan quickly recognized the work environment as a strategic setting to stir up all manner of sin, including covetousness, jealousies, self-indulgence, living beyond one&rsquo;s means, anger, contention in marriages, infidelity, greed and envy, selfishness, even theft and murder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here at BYU Idaho you are learning, not only how to make a living, but more importantly, how to make a good and honest living.&nbsp; Your mid-term tests and final exams are indicators of your progress in preparing for a profession, but they pale in comparison and importance to the celestial tests the Lord will be monitoring as He observes your daily behavior in your dealings with your fellowmen. What you do to make a living, or how many dollars you earn, aren&rsquo;t nearly as important to the Lord as whether you:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Scrooge.jpg" border="0" title="(Still images from A CHRISTMAS CAROL (Renown Pictures Ltd. 1951) courtesy of VCI Entertainment.)" />In Charles Dicken&rsquo;s classic story,<em> A</em> <em>Christmas Carol</em>, Ebenezer Scrooge undergoes an amazing transformation, from a ruthless money lender, to a caring and charitable businessman and philanthropist.&nbsp; As his motives evolve in the story, transforming him from a cruel and stingy miser to a compassionate member of his community, we witness a marvelous impact on him and others that touches us profoundly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The motives that drive people are the hinges upon which major outcomes swing.</p>
<p>In making a living, the Lord identified two opposite motivators &ndash; God and mammon. &nbsp;&nbsp;We know that money itself is not evil; in fact, it represents &ldquo;the sweat of our face&rdquo; &ndash; a commandment of the Lord.&nbsp; Mammon goes beyond money to &ldquo;the love of money&rdquo; and is referred to as &ldquo;the root of all evil&rdquo; we read in 1 Tim. 6:10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to share some illustrations of the interplay between a love of God and our fellowmen on the one hand, and the need to make a living on the other. &nbsp;There are several combinations of these two motives which, for demonstration purposes, I will give the following grades:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong></p>
<p><strong>Primary Motivation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secondary Motivation</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>A</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Love of God and fellowmen &copy;</p>
<p>Income&nbsp; <strong>$</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>At the A-level, The Lord established the correct order with priorities as we read in Jacob 2:18-19,, &ldquo;Before you seek for riches, seek the kingdom of God.&nbsp; And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; At this level the primary motivation is a love of God and our fellowmen.&nbsp; Of necessity, there is a secondary motivation to earn a living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a love of God and fellowmen is the primary motivation, then the working man or woman will be a kingdom builder and a full-tithe payer. They will have a &ldquo;zeal towards their fellow men . . . and will be perfectly honest and upright in all things&rdquo; (Alma27:27).&nbsp; As a laborer they will be &ldquo;worthy of their hire&rdquo; (Luke 10:7). &nbsp;As an employer they will give a &ldquo;just recompense of wages,&rdquo; (D&amp;C 124:121).&nbsp; They will be a beloved employer and endeavor to help, not only their customers, but also their employees and community. They will have a baker&rsquo;s dozen mentality with superior customer service. Sometimes this person will even render service at no charge to help someone in need, such as those doctors who travel to Third-world countries to help the disadvantaged.&nbsp; Their products and services are of the highest quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those at the A-level aren&rsquo;t working for mankind, but living for mankind, trying to lift and help others. &nbsp;In addition to making a living, they are making a life.&nbsp; They have a different vision than those at lower levels.&nbsp; Because of their love for their fellowmen, they define their business in terms of <em>customers&rsquo; needs</em>, such as a builder of homes rather than merely a brick mason. &nbsp;&nbsp;At levels B through D, business is usually defined in terms of <em>products</em> <em>and services</em> rather than <em>customers&rsquo; needs</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong></p>
<p><strong>Primary Motivation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secondary Motivation</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>A</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Love of God and fellowmen&nbsp; &copy;</p>

<p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A love of God can only exist at the A-level, since the person who loves God would always put Him first, not being able to serve two masters.&nbsp; At the B-level, the primary motivation is money, but there is still a love of fellowmen and a genuine desire to provide good products and services to customers.&nbsp; This could even be an A-level person or company who has been sidetracked by the world.&nbsp; It is difficult for a company which goes public to remain at the A-level.&nbsp; The pressure on the board of directors and corporate officers to increase the value of the stock is so great that many lose sight of the A-level vision that helped them achieve their success in the first place.&nbsp; Concern for the stockholder and the bottom line will almost always force an &ldquo;A&rdquo; company to the B-level and sometimes lower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong></p>
<p><strong>Primary Motivation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secondary Motivation</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>A</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Love of God and fellowmen&nbsp; &copy;</p>

<p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>At the C- level, the &ldquo;love of money&rdquo; is the only motivator.&nbsp; The businessman or woman engineers minimal quality, or the appearance of quality, into their products and services so that they may be competitive and survive, but look for the cheapest ways to produce, without any true concern for their customer. Their personal integrity is compromised as they begin to engage in dishonest practices, such as deceptive advertising and meaningless guarantees.&nbsp; The customer is often considered a nuisance when problems arise and usually neglected so that the businessman or woman can be on to a new customer.&nbsp; Since the business already has its profit, they are slow to respond to customers with complaints.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve probably had a &ldquo;C&rdquo; company sell you something and then not service it afterward, which not only frustrated you, but caused you to lose any loyalty whatsoever to that company.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never shop there again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong></p>
<p><strong>Primary Motivation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secondary Motivation</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>A</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Love of God and fellowmen&nbsp; &copy;</p>

<p>Indifferent to clients or customers</p>
<p align="center"><strong>D</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Filthy Lucre&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>$</strong></p>
<p>Harmful to clients and customers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the D-level, the unwary are more victims than customers.&nbsp; Once again the motivation is the love of money, but this time at the peril of the customer, who will be harmed and maybe even injured or killed.&nbsp; Profits at this level are known as &ldquo;filthy lucre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Spencer W. Kimball.jpg" border="0" width="121" height="137" />&ldquo;Filthy Lucre,&rdquo; President Spencer W. Kimball said, &ldquo;is that had through sin or sinful operations and that which comes from the handling of liquor, beer, narcotics and those many other things which are displeasing in the sight of the Lord. . . those who deal in the forbidden are recipients of filthy lucre.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Melchizedek Priesthood Personal Study Guide 1984, p. 84)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the category of which the Doctrine and Covenants warned, &ldquo;In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you . . .&rdquo; (D&amp;C 89:4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to those things mentioned by President Kimball, we would also include tobacco, pornography, prostitution, and gambling, etc.&nbsp; While some of these things may be legal, they can still be unhealthy, immoral and maybe even lethal.&nbsp; In his insightful book <em>Winners Never Cheat</em>, Elder Jon M. Huntsman writes, &ldquo;Cigarettes are an example of a legal product that, when used as directed, causes death.&nbsp; Tobacco companies cloak their consciences with the simplistic observation that no one forces people to smoke." &nbsp;(<em>Winners Never Cheat</em> by Jon M. Huntsman, p 75)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interesting insight with this model is that all professions, businesses, and services can be found at all levels or grades A - D.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are A-level accountants and there are D-level accountants.&nbsp; The D-level accountant cooks the books, which occurred at ENRON and WorldCom where dishonest business practices eventually caused the business to collapse. &nbsp;Their focus was on the bottom line at the peril of their customers and shareholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are A-level bankers and D-level bankers.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/It's a Wonderful Life-1.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the movie &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life&rdquo; starring Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, Bailey&rsquo;s Savings and Loan is an A-level bank with a love of their fellowmen and a genuine desire to help families get out of the low quality housing in Potter&rsquo;s Field and into a respectable home of their own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Potter.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Potter, on the other hand, was a ruthless and uncaring man who thought nothing of stealing the $8,000 that Uncle Billy misplaced in a rolled- up newspaper while making a deposit.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Jimmy Stewart &amp; Potter.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one point in the movie, Potter makes George an offer he can&rsquo;t refuse, to come and work for Potter at many times the income George is currently making, including some very attractive benefits.&nbsp; One of those benefits was George&rsquo;s dream --to travel.&nbsp;&nbsp; George is momentarily mesmerized by the offer, and then realizes he is being offered a job with a D-level employer.&nbsp; Upset with himself for even considering the offer, he calls Mr. Potter, &ldquo;Nothing but a scurvy little spider&rdquo; (which is a good description for a D-level person) and walks out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Scrooge-2.jpg" border="0" /><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Tiny Tim.jpg" border="0" width="352" height="309" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In &ldquo;A Christmas Carol,&rdquo; Scrooge made the transformation from a ruthless D-level lender as the story begins, including a total disregard for his fellowmen and a desire to &ldquo;decrease the surplus population,&rdquo; to an A-level gentleman as the story concludes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One reason you occasionally hear jokes about attorneys is because people often consider it a profession that rarely transcends the D-level. Those at this level were referred to as &ldquo;cunning&rdquo; in The Book of Mormon. (See Alma 10:15) While it is true that there are lawyers at the D-level, there are many who are or have been A-level -- Howard W. Hunter, James E. Faust, Dallin H. Oaks, Quentin L Cook, &nbsp;D. Todd Christofferson, to name a few.&nbsp; One reason the book, <em>To Kill a Mockingbird,</em> has become one of the all time literary classics is because of the inspirational example of an A-level attorney, Atticus Finch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another profession, which people tend to place in the D category by nature, is politicians.&nbsp; You can think of several D-level politicians right now, as there are many to choose from throughout the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The A-level politicians are men like King Benjamin and Mosiah from the Book of Mormon, or George Washington and Abraham Lincoln from our history books.&nbsp; For these men money was not their primary motivator, but actually risked their own fortunes defending their country.&nbsp; They were true patriots, whose primary motivation was a love of God, their fellowmen and their country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Apple.jpg" border="0" width="104" height="196" />What about teachers?&nbsp; It is only fair that they should receive the same grades that they give their students.&nbsp; The best teachers get an A.&nbsp; They are often voted &ldquo;Teacher of the Year.&rdquo;&nbsp; D-level teachers are biding their time until retirement.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t really care for the children in their class and can even damage or destroy a child&rsquo;s self-worth by labeling him, calling him names and publicly ridiculing him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At our local grade school the vast majority of our childrens&rsquo; teachers have been at the A and B-level.&nbsp; However, in two different years, two of our children were placed in classes with D-level teachers.&nbsp; The D-nature of each teacher manifested itself quite quickly.&nbsp; It was clear that these teachers did not like teaching and did not like children, often doing cruel things to them.&nbsp; My wife is intolerant of &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;D&rdquo; level teachers assigned to our children.&nbsp; When the principal would not or could not move our children to another classroom and teacher, my wife pulled the children out of the school and placed them in a distant school less convenient to our family.&nbsp; The inconvenience of driving them to the other school was a small price to pay for the life-impacting benefits gained from the better teachers that our children received, in those instances.</p>

<p><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Carpenters.jpg" border="0" />How about carpenters?&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever purchased anything made by a &ldquo;C&rdquo; or &ldquo;D&rdquo; level carpenter?&nbsp;&nbsp; What was the product like?&nbsp; Do you still have it, or did you have to get rid of it because of poor quality?&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of carpenter do you think Brigham Young was?&nbsp; Or the carpenter from Nazareth?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;An A-level store owner gives, in the Savior&rsquo;s words, a &ldquo;good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over&rdquo; (Luke 6:38), while the D-level store owner uses &ldquo;a false balance&rdquo; (Proverbs 11:1) tipped in his favor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Medical Instruments.jpg" border="0" width="192" height="131" />Even for the respected industry of medicine, there are doctors at the A-level and there are doctors at the &nbsp;D-level.&nbsp; A D-level doctor is one who will selfishly perform unnecessary operations to satisfy his greed, or those who have signed up with rogue Internet pharmacies and prescribe dangerous drugs to people they have not examined. (See &ldquo;The Pill Peddlers, Reader&rsquo;s Digest, Oct. 2004, 141)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we hear stories of a D-level person who is not playing by the rules and appears to be prospering and out-performing those who are playing by the rules, almost as if they had an unfair advantage. In such cases we feel a sense of injustice and frustration, as noted in this quote from Jeremiah 12:1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?&nbsp; Wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appearances can be deceiving.&nbsp; It may seem that the wicked are prosperous and happy, but we know that &ldquo;wickedness never was happiness.&rdquo; (Alma 41:10) Given 20 more years, who do you think the customers will naturally gravitate to, George Bailey or Mr. Potter?&nbsp; Who will be most successful over the long run with the greatest customer loyalty?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most basic of all marketing principles is to give the customer what he or she wants and deserves.&nbsp; It is a principle that was taught by the Savior which we know as the golden rule, &ldquo;Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets&rdquo;&nbsp; (3 Ne. 14:12).&nbsp; &nbsp;Many businesses forget that principle.&nbsp; Some cut corners and produce inferior products.&nbsp; Some are guilty of price fixing.&nbsp; Some are guilty of deceptive advertising.&nbsp; These and many other strategies are the ways Satan tempts men to serve mammon.&nbsp; The following are some important questions to ask of everyone in the workforce:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scrooge finally started paying Bob Cratchet a fair wage and providing comfortable working conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Referring once again to the book, <em>Winners never Cheat</em>, Elder Huntsman referred to a<em> Wall Street Journal </em>report which ranked attributes that recruiters looked for in hiring new personnel.&nbsp; He noted that the three highest ranking traits were Christ-like attributes&mdash;Interpersonal skills, an ability to work well within a team, and personal integrity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Curiously,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;work experience and strategic thinking were in the middle of the list of the 20 most desired traits for new hires.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<em>Winners never Cheat</em> by Jon M. Huntsman, p 91-92)&nbsp; As the world becomes increasingly more wicked it will become more and more difficult to find people of integrity.&nbsp; I believe the search for people of integrity&nbsp; is already drawing more and more recruiters to BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; You are a rare and highly prized commodity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some decisions that face members of the Church are not always easy or clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are three helpful principles to help you make A-level choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can you ask the Lord&rsquo;s blessings with a clear conscience</strong><em>? </em>&nbsp;We learn in Alma 34:24-25 that you can pray for success in your labors -- &ldquo;over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them. . . over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.&rdquo; <em>&nbsp;The Church Handbook of Instruction </em>&nbsp;teaches us that &ldquo;Members of the Church should endeavor to be involved in activities and employment upon which they can conscientiously ask the blessings of the Lord and which are consistent with the principles of the gospel and the teachings of the Savior.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<em>Church Handbook of Instructions</em>, Book 1 2006, p. 179)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When questionable products or services are involved, is the person&rsquo;s involvement direct or indirect?&nbsp; </strong>Can an A-level grocer, for example, sell coffee and tea to those customers who know nothing of the Word of Wisdom and for whom it would not be a sin?&nbsp; The grocer might do so at the request of his customers to meet their demands when he clearly would never produce coffee himself.&nbsp; His involvement is indirect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Does the product or service hurt society?</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some products and services may be detrimental to the individual while others damage the community.&nbsp; Coffee and tea, for example, would be products that have individual consequences. Alcohol and pornography, however, have proven to also have community consequences.&nbsp; Alcohol has resulted in traffic accidents and domestic violence; pornography has led to divorce and broken homes, pedophilia, rape, murder, etc. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pornography damages individual lives, families, <em>and society . . </em>. Church members should . . . oppose its production<em>, dissemination, and use</em>.&rdquo; (Emphasis added, <em>Church Handbook of Instructions</em>, Book 1 2010, 166) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An A-level company feels a community responsibility that goes beyond respecting individual agency or rights and customer demands. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Spencer W. Kimball.jpg" border="0" width="115" height="146" />Years ago, while on a stake visit, President Kimball interviewed a brother who was a grocer by trade.&nbsp; I quote President Kimball,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you sell in this store?&rsquo; . . . &lsquo;Groceries and miscellaneous merchandise.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Your competitors sell other things including forbidden things, do they not?&rsquo;&nbsp; I asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, but we have felt it was not right. . . We lost trade, of course.&nbsp; People leave our store and go to the other store and buy many dollar&rsquo;s worth of groceries where they can get a few cans of beer or some wine, but we do not sell it.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I could not refrain from saying, &lsquo;God bless you, my faithful brother. . . . Your dollars are clean.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; (Melchizedek Priesthood Personal Study Guide 1984, p. 84)</p>
<p>&nbsp;With these additional thoughts, we can add one more level to the model which we will label &ldquo;F&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong></p>
<p><strong>Primary Motivation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secondary Motivation</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>A</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Love&nbsp; &copy;</p>
<p>Income&nbsp; <strong>$</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>B</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Money&nbsp; <strong>$</strong></p>
<p>Love&nbsp; &copy;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>C</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Love of money&nbsp; <strong>$</strong></p>
<p>Indifferent to customers</p>
<p align="center"><strong>D</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Filthy Lucre&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>$</strong></p>
<p>Harmful to customers</p>
<p align="center"><strong>F</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Filthy Lucre</p>
<p>Harmful to customers and to society, nations destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>At this level are the unscrupulous individuals and companies whose involvement is &lsquo;direct&rsquo; and whose <em>primary</em> business damages or destroys society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about those whose involvement in F-level products and services is not direct, nor is it their primary business, such as a grocer who sells beer and wine or pornographic magazines fearing he will lose business if doesn&rsquo;t provide it?&nbsp; Because his primary business and motivation is good, he may not be at the D or F-level, but due to his disregard for principle #3 above, and as an abettor of the forbidden, he is now excluded from the A category as that level has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many at the F-level were identified earlier at the D-level, but may actually fit better at this level because of their negative impact on communities and nations.&nbsp; At this level, we also find the parasites of society, those who don&rsquo;t contribute, but only take -- organized crime, con artists, internet scams, Ponzi schemes, etc.&nbsp; At this level, you have murder and elimination of competition.&nbsp; It is at this level where secret combinations operate, like the Gadiantons who destroyed both the Jaredite and the Nephite civilizations and according to Moroni will be a very real threat in our day. (see Ether 8:24.) &nbsp;These are they who by secret design and murder place their friends on the &ldquo;judgment seats&rdquo; of the world --dictators and tyrants who destroy nations. The Apostle Paul referred to such individuals as &ldquo;rulers of the darkness of this world.&rdquo; (Ephesians 6:12)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some at this level, like purveyors of pornography, justify their wares based upon law and legality.&nbsp; Will freedom of speech protect pornography in the New Jerusalem?&nbsp; Absurd!&nbsp;&nbsp; The phrases, &ldquo;Pro-choice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Freedom of Speech&rdquo; when promoted by Satan, are really evil euphemisms masquerading as good &ndash; a wolf dressed in sheep&rsquo;s clothing &nbsp;who is demanding to dine with the sheep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of the New Jerusalem and life in the millennium, work in a Zion society will be guided by the law of consecration and having all things in common. &nbsp;Because the earth has &lsquo;enough and to spare&rsquo; there will be no unemployment in the millennium.&nbsp; The great millennial motivators will be the first two great commandments, a love of God and a love of fellowmen.&nbsp; It was these same A-level motivators that resulted in the great prosperity and happiness enjoyed in both the City of Enoch and with the Nephites for 200 years following the Savior&rsquo;s visit to them.&nbsp; One way to prepare for future life in the millennial day is to make sure our motives and behavior are at the A-level today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Benson mentioned that, &ldquo;It was essentially the sin of pride that kept us from establishing Zion in the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith. It was the same sin of pride that brought consecration to an end among the Nephites. (See <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/4_ne/1/24-25#24" target="contentWindow">4 Ne. 1:24&ndash;25</a>)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pride seduces a person from the A-level to the B-level or lower.&nbsp; It would be difficult, if not impossible, for a proud person to remain at the A-level, because of the &ldquo;enmity&rdquo; he has towards his fellowmen men, citing Pres. Benson. (ibid)&nbsp;&nbsp; This enmity is opposite the love of God and our fellowmen which is the first motivator at the A-level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A common and recurring nightmare for many people is to suddenly realize they have forgotten to attend class all semester, and it is now time for the final exam.&nbsp; In the dream, they are panic stricken wondering how they could have ever been so absent-minded, with no time remaining to turn in assignments or to cram for the imminent final exam.&nbsp; They are grateful to awaken in the morning and realize it was only a dream.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This dream has a parallel.&nbsp; For many it will be a nightmare come true, when at judgment day, they realize they neglected the most important class of their life and are totally unprepared for the ultimate of all final exams. Alma forewarned of the nightmare when he asked, &ldquo;can ye imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect remembrance . . . ? (Alma 5:18)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Marley &amp; Scrooge.jpg" border="0" width="204" height="219" />In <em>A Christmas Carol,</em> Marley is living this nightmare, bound in the chains he &ldquo;forged in life, link by link.&rdquo;&nbsp; He vocalizes the nightmare, in response to a comment made by Scrooge, &ldquo;But you were always a good man of business, Jacob.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Business!&rdquo; cried Marley, . . . &ldquo;Mankind was my business.&nbsp; The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business.&nbsp; The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business! . . . Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode?&nbsp; Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;(<em>The Annotated Christmas Carol,</em> ed. Michael Patrick Hearn (1976), 79)</p>
<p>I mentioned your mid-term tests and final exams as indicators of your progress in preparing for a profession, but said they pale in comparison and importance to the celestial tests the Lord will be monitoring as He observes your daily behavior in your dealings with your fellowmen.&nbsp; In your pursuit of an income, may you remember, as Marley stated, that mankind is your true business. &nbsp;You should be congratulated if you earn &ldquo;A&rdquo; grades here at BYU-Idaho, but they are meaningless if you don&rsquo;t achieve the more important &ldquo;A&rdquo; grade in life.&nbsp; The Savior is your example in becoming an A-level individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, may each of you be guided by the Spirit in all your employment decisions -- in finding A-level employment and in being an A-level employee, yourself.&nbsp; May you each use your God-given talents in the service of your fellowmen and making your communities and world a better place to live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;bear my testimony of the Savior and his perfect example.&nbsp; His desire is for you to be happy and successful -&ndash; and to make both a living and a life.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.&rdquo;&nbsp; (John 10:10)&nbsp; He cares for you and will bless you as you follow true and correct principles, I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this devotional at BYU-Idaho. I express my appreciation for all the brothers and sisters who have contributed in any way to make this devotional possible. I feel gratitude for President and Sister Kim B. Clark for all they do, not only for this devotional, but for the great service they render to those of you who attend this university.&nbsp; They provide a great example for all of us and I know their impact will be felt for many years to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is an honor to speak a few words to a congregation like this one. You come from different backgrounds with a variety of hopes, dreams and aspirations. One thing you all have in common, however, is the present opportunity to be at this great university to study and prepare for your future life.&nbsp; I echo President Thomas S. Monson&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;This is the day of our opportunity, and we must grasp it.&rdquo;<sup>1 </sup>You are young people with a promising and challenging future ahead. You have so many dreams, and that is a great thing.&nbsp; Dreams can become reality. You are here to get an education and that is important. &nbsp;It is important for you, it is important for your family, it is important for the community and it is important for the Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my life I have valued the importance of getting an education since I was very young. I was born and raised in Montevideo, Uruguay, in South America. It was there that I learned the importance of getting an education. My father was a carpenter and he often reminded us of his principles or values.&nbsp; He was always saying that the best legacy that he could give us was not material things, but rather an education. It was not hard to accept this principle as a gospel principle once I became a member of the Church. Getting an education is a gospel principle. Like many gospel principles, it comes with at least one promise. In the year 2000, President Gordon B. Hinckley taught the youth of the Church about this principle. &ldquo;Be smart,&rdquo; he said. He advised the youth to get an education. He promised that those who train their hands and their mind would bring honor to their families and to the Church when he said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You belong to a church that teaches the importance of education.&nbsp; You have a mandate from the Lord to educate your minds and your hearts and your hands...And as you do so and as you perform honorably and with excellence, you will bring honor to the Church, for you will be regarded as a man or woman of integrity and ability and conscientious workmanship.&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a promise! Each of you has embarked on such a path. To this counsel from President Hinckley, we can add very practical advice given by our beloved living prophet. During an interview in May 2008, President Monson said: "You want to be prepared to take advantage of the opportunities that come your way. If you're not prepared, you're in difficulty . . . It isn't enough to simply get an education . . . Young men should plan to study something that they enjoy and will allow them to earn a living. A person may possess a fondness for, say, Egyptian pottery&mdash;but the job opportunities in such a field may be limited . . . Study something you like to do and something that will enable you to have a family and sustain your family." <sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you strive to get an education here at BYU-Idaho, you are also getting what we may call the ultimate education. It is the most relevant of all the educations. Whether you realize it or not, you are working to achieve much more than a college degree. You are working to become like Christ.&nbsp; In this sense, life is like unto attending school day and night. Each of us is in this school called life to show our God that we will be faithful in all things. In this process we go through life taking quizzes and exams. We know some of them are coming because they are like midterms. Most, however, are like pop quizzes. They are given without previous notice. Often we call those quizzes and exams the tests of life. As we pass these different tests, we advance in the curriculum of becoming Christ-like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, some of you may feel concerned about what the curriculum of this school of life has in store for you. You may wonder about your future, about tuition, about your grades, or about work. Some may feel lonely or left out. One thing is certain, though, we are not left to our own devices. In a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith in Manchester, New York, in March of 1830, the Lord gave some specific commandments. These commandments are instrumental in going through the school of life. That day in March of 1830, the Savior said: "Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me."<sup>4&nbsp;</sup> The sequence in the scriptures is oftentimes very meaningful. In this case, we are advised to engage in three specific activities, namely: learn, listen, and walk. We are also given the divine promise that by so doing, we will have peace in Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing we are commanded to do is to learn of Him. There are many ways to learn of Him and each of us may have our own way of doing so. One way is by observing the life of the Savior. During His ministry here on our continent, He said to His disciples: &ldquo;for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do."<sup>5</sup> We can learn a lot simply by observing Him and acting accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Observe what we learn in the book of Luke, for example, when the Savior was surrounded by a multitude of people as he headed to the house of Jairus. Jairus was a ruler of the synagogue, a prestigious member of society. He had come to Jesus and dropped to his feet, begging the Lord for help. His only daughter who was about 12 years of age was at home and she was dying. The scripture says that as the Savior headed to Jairus&rsquo; house, there in the multitude was a woman who was very ill with a blood issue. She had no hope of being cured and she had spent all her earthly possessions in medical treatment, to no avail. This woman reached out and touched the border of His garment. The Savior asked: &ldquo;Who touched me?&rdquo; Peter, perhaps somewhat confused, answered with a question of his own: &ldquo;Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?&rdquo; The woman, knowing that she had been discovered, confessed. Now listen carefully to the beautiful words the Lord uttered in response: &ldquo;Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can we learn from observing the Savior in this episode of His life? If it were possible for you to express your thoughts, I am sure that all of you would have ideas regarding what we can learn from this episode of the Savior's life. I would like to share what I observed and learned. &nbsp;Notice that He was surrounded by a multitude that called for his attention as much as they could. Further, He was on his way to help someone else. He was in a stressful situation, with a busy schedule, yet he stopped. He looked around for that one person, that one ill woman who needed Him in the midst of the multitude. He showed absolute concern for the one. We could review many examples in the Bible and in the Book of Mormon where the Savior shows this type of caring for the one. How does this attribute of the Savior relate to us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord commanded us to do those things that He did. Are we taking time to stop and look around to find that one person who needs our help? Are we looking for the one individual in the campus hall, in the store, in the ward, in your family? If you look around, you will find roommates, family members, friends, and others who are in need of comfort. These are the Marthas and the Marys and the Lazaruses and the lepers and the blind and the women with &lsquo;issues of blood&rsquo; that God has put in the multitude of your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will find it very useful to improve the quality of your life by observing how the Lord faced challenges similar to yours. Let me share an example. We all face temptations just as the Savior himself did. We know that "He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them."<sup>7</sup> When He was preparing for the ministry, He was "led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be with God and the tempter came to him and said, &ldquo;If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."&nbsp; The book of Matthew teaches us that the enemy tempted Him two more times. All three times, the Savior rebuked Satan by quoting the scriptures.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now consider your specific temptations. When you face them, do you know the scriptures in such a way that you can find strength in quoting them by heart? During your days as students, you may be so busy acquiring knowledge that you may fail to take the time to immerse yourselves in the scriptures. This immersion in the scriptures could be your life vest when the temptations come. Immerse yourself in the scriptures to look for answers to the questions of your life. Immerse yourself in the scriptures to search for gospel principles that you can "(write in the) fleshy tables of [your] heart."<sup>9</sup> We can learn so much from the life of the Savior based on the accounts we have in the scriptures! He did many good things, for &ldquo;he went about doing good&rdquo; always.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that context, I would like to draw your attention to another challenge that you may be facing this very moment. This challenge may come as a result of your unique situation, but you may know how to cope with it by learning of the Savior. For example, if you are single and your family is far away, the type of thoughts that may be going through your mind might include what shall I do today, what shall I study, what shall I eat, how shall I pay tuition, who shall I date, and so forth. The risk here is that you may become too self-centered. I am talking about what we may identify as the &ldquo;I&rdquo; syndrome that a person may suffer during the college years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you learn from the life and teachings of the Savior, you will realize that service to others is always one solution to any self-centered spree. In that spirit, I encourage you to analyze what you are doing with your spare time.&nbsp; You might find yourself in a chat room or spending many hours in online social networks.&nbsp; Social networks are a good way to keep in contact with friends and family, but don&rsquo;t let them be a substitute for face-to-face contact. Don&rsquo;t let social networks or video games consume too much time. You could more wisely use that time in helping someone in need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second thing we are commanded to do after learning of Him in the revelation given by the Lord is &ldquo;Listen to my words.&rdquo; One way we listen to His words is by searching the scriptures. Another way to listen and hear His voice is to hear the voice of His servants. For, it is the same.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In these latter days we are uniquely blessed to be able to listen to the words of living prophets, live, every six months. One of my favorite activities when I want to listen to His words is paying attention to the messages given during General Conference. Last month, we had the blessing of listening to those that He has chosen to teach us. I like listening to the teachings that are given. When I do that, I specifically enjoy paying attention to the promises that are given. They fill my soul with hope. They are very relevant, no matter what our station in the school of life may be. As you go through college, you are faced with many pressures and tasks. Each day may find you rushing to place a check mark showing that you can accomplish needed tasks. You may feel overwhelmed or that you are failing to complete your tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now listen to the words of the Lord through His servants. Last General Conference, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught about keeping things simple. He pointed out that simplification is the greatest of all sophistications. He also said: &ldquo;May I suggest that you reduce the rush and take a little extra time to get to know yourself better . . . Learn to see yourself as Heavenly Father sees you&mdash;as His precious daughter or son with divine potential.&rdquo;<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you really see yourself as His precious daughter or son with divine potential?&nbsp; Our Heavenly Father sees us as we really are. When we are sad, tired, laden, or discouraged, we can turn to Him for help. The Savior himself gave the example. After He had received the news of the passing of John the Baptist&mdash;very sad news&mdash;after teaching all day long to a multitude, after healing many of their infirmities, after feeding them, He went to a secluded place to pray to the Father. We could say such a day was a busy one for the Savior, but after all of that, He turned to His Father.<sup>13</sup> Are we following His example of turning to our Heavenly Father for help, knowing that we are His children? I know that our Father in Heaven is loving and willing to make our burdens light. Our Father in Heaven absolutely will help us to avoid the rush and the feeling of being overwhelmed. He is there to help each one of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The messages from the living oracles of the Lord will always help us to listen to His words and will contribute to our becoming Christ-like. One recent example is the message from President Thomas S. Monson during the Sunday morning session. He spoke about cultivating an attitude of gratitude. He said, &ldquo;Cultivate within [your] hearts an attitude of gratitude.&rdquo; You have so much to be grateful for. Each of you may have a long list of reasons to be grateful.&nbsp; We know that in that long list you have &ldquo;those things which provide deep and lasting happiness and gratitude&rdquo; as President Monson said. &ldquo;Things which money cannot buy: our families, the gospel, good friends, our health, our abilities, the love we receive from those around us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another reason to be grateful is the chance that you have to attend a school like BYU-Idaho. Be grateful because you are receiving higher education. Such gratitude will bring additional blessings to your life. Notice that President Monson promised that if you are grateful, the doors of heaven will unlock for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior himself gave us many examples of a life full of gratitude. In Chapter 19 of 3 Nephi, we learn that He kneeled and thanked His Father. He first thanked Him for the Spirit given to his disciples.<sup>14</sup> Later, the doors of heaven were unlocked and we see Him thanking for the purification of those that have been chosen.<sup>15</sup> When the doors of heaven are unlocked it is easier to understand President Monson's comment that &ldquo;to express gratitude is gracious and honorable, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live with gratitude ever in our hearts is to touch heaven.&rdquo;<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we are grateful, we will be happier and those around us will be happier as well.&nbsp; In President Monson&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;how much happier we are in the presence of a grateful and loving soul, and how careful we should be to cultivate, through the medium of a prayerful life, a thankful attitude toward God and man!&rdquo;<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now imagine what a difference this thankful attitude can make in your daily life and the life of those around you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hearing the words of the living prophets is one way of listening to the Lord&rsquo;s voice. As we learn of Him and listen to His words, the Holy Ghost will testify of every true principle. Our learning and becoming processes will be completed by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; I take great comfort in that knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third thing that we are commanded to do is "walk in the meekness of His spirit." Notice the operative word here is &ldquo;walk.&rdquo; We are to learn, listen, and then walk. When the Savior says, &ldquo;Walk in the meekness of my spirit,&rdquo; He is giving us a call to action. It is a call to walk as He walked. The Lord always does the will of the Father. He submitted his will to the will of His Father and He did it with deep love and trust in His Father. It is in the doing that you will get to know the Lord in an even more profound way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior himself expressed how important it is to do the will of the Father.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;The Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.&rdquo; The same applies to us; the Father will not leave us alone during the quizzes and tests of life if we do what pleases Him.&nbsp; If you take time&mdash;even today&mdash;to think of the things that please the Father and walk accordingly, you will not be left alone.&nbsp; You will be moving in the right direction in your process to become Christ-like.&nbsp; You will perhaps find yourself helping someone in need, being more spiritual or being more Christ-like.&nbsp; It pleases our Father when we learn of Him, listen to His words and walk in the meekness of His spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a very specific direction for success in the curriculum of the school of life. The sequence is clear and the promise that follows cannot be better, "you shall have peace in me." I testify to you that the type of peace Jesus Christ offers does bring gratitude and joy. As we take the necessary steps to find peace in Him, we will understand that "wickedness never was happiness." We will discover that in this life, in this very hour, we can live in a state according "to the nature of happiness."<sup>17</sup> We can have peace in Him in this very moment. Using the wording of Alma when he was preaching in Zarahemla, I would ask, &ldquo;can ye feel so now?"<sup>19</sup> This promise of "peace in Him" fills my soul with joy and hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is an honor for me to testify to you about the Savior. We are so blessed to be alive in the days of the restoration when we have essential knowledge that is important for our eternal salvation. The Book of Mormon is the word of God. I know it is a book of divine origin because it persuades me "to do good." The Book of Mormon helps me learn about the Savior. It helps me listen to the Lord's words. It helps me walk in the meekness of His spirit. This sacred book helps me to feel His peace.&nbsp; This knowledge about the Savior and His gospel came to us through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I know Joseph Smith was the prophet at the beginning of this dispensation. I especially testify that today President Thomas S. Monson is the living prophet of our living God. I know that Jesus Christ is the son of the living God. Jesus is the living Christ. He is the Holy Messiah. He is the Anointed One.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, Sister Oswald and I thank you for your kind invitation to come to Rexburg and to be with you today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that many of you are approaching the times and seasons of your life when you will be making some of the great decisions of mortality:&nbsp; Should I serve a mission<strong>? </strong>&nbsp;What career choice should I make?&nbsp; Whom should I choose as my eternal companion<strong>?&mdash;</strong>and, of equal importance,<strong> </strong>will they also want to choose me? <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Today I begin my remarks with a compelling question: &ldquo;Where <em>woul</em>d we&mdash;or <em>should</em> we&mdash;or <em>can</em> we go for directions on how to live our lives?&rdquo;&nbsp; The answers to all of these questions are so</p>
<p>important that I recommend that you seek out the divine help to which you are entitled.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In addition to fasting and praying for confirming answers, the holy scriptures&mdash;those books filled with deep insight, wisdom and knowledge&mdash;should also occupy a prominent place in helping you make the important decisions in your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I share with you three keys which have been helpful to me in opening the door to a greater understanding and appreciation of the scriptures?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key No. 1&mdash;&ldquo;<strong>F</strong><strong>east upon the words of Christ</strong>. . .&rdquo;&nbsp; The blessing promised for obedience to this commandment is that &ldquo;the words of Christ will <em>tell</em> you all things what ye should do&rdquo; (2 Nephi 32:3, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key No. 2&mdash;<strong>&ldquo;Ask,&rdquo; &ldquo;seek&rdquo; and &ldquo;knock.&rdquo;&nbsp; </strong>The blessing promised for obedience to this commandment is that &ldquo;<em>every one</em> that asketh <em>receiveth</em>; and he that seeketh <em>findeth</em>; and to him that knocketh <em>it shall be opened</em>&rdquo; (Matthew 7:8, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key No. 3&mdash;&ldquo;<strong>Receive the Holy Ghost</strong>. . .&rdquo;&nbsp; The blessing promised for obedience to this commandment is that the Holy Ghost &ldquo;will <em>show</em> you all things what ye should<strong> </strong>do&rdquo; (2 Nephi 32:5, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us begin by discussing Key No. 1.&nbsp; Throughout the scriptures w<strong>e </strong>are commanded to &ldquo;feast upon the words of Christ. . .&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some elements of feasting on the words of Christ include the Savior&rsquo;s admonition to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search<strong> </strong>the scriptures&rdquo; (John 5:39);</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Study my word . . .&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants 11:22);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . (L)earn of me&rdquo; (Matthew 11:29);&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search these commandments&rdquo; ((Doctrine and Covenants 1:37); and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Treasure] up my word@&nbsp; (Joseph Smith translation of Matthew 1:37), with this accompanying promise: &ldquo;And whoso treasureth up my word, shall not be deceived. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the plain and precious meaning of these commandments, we often neglect the scriptures.&nbsp; We do not take the time to &ldquo;feast upon the words of Christ&rdquo; as we should.&nbsp; Instead, we treat the scriptures like a &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; snack waiting to be picked up at some drive through window while rushing off to some other activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My former neighbor Elder Neal A. Maxwell described what feasting on the scriptures ought to entail: &ldquo;For me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Book of Mormon is like a vast mansion with gardens, towers, courtyards, and wings.&nbsp; My tour of it has never been completed.&nbsp; Some rooms I have yet to enter, and there are more flaming fireplaces waiting to warm me. . . There are also sumptuous banquet tables painstakingly prepared . . . which await all of us.&nbsp; Yet, we as Church members sometimes behave like hurried tourists, scarcely venturing beyond the entry hall to the mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his last General Conference Elder Maxwell shared this humorous true story suggesting that even his young grandchildren knew him for his love of the scriptures.&nbsp; He told about the time he visited his grandchildren late one evening.&nbsp; His grandson Robbie had already gone to bed when he arrived.&nbsp; Robbie&rsquo;s mother called to her son: &ldquo;Robbie, Grandpa Neal is here!&rdquo;&nbsp; Elder Maxwell heard a tired little voice coming from the bedroom asking, &ldquo;Shall I bring my scriptures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us begin by turning to one of my favorite scriptures&mdash;Alma, chapter 31, verse 5&mdash;as an example of how the scriptures can unexpectedly change lives of people.&nbsp; You will remember that the Prophet Alma became the leader of a mission to try to reclaim the apostate Zoramites&mdash;those who had once been active members of the Church, but had been seduced by false doctrines and had fallen away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the language in this verse, it appears that Alma tried a number of different ways to reclaim the apostates, but nothing seemed to work.&nbsp; Finally, Alma decided to do something different, to teach the Zoramites the word of God out of the scriptures.&nbsp; His success is reflected in these words: &ldquo;And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just&ndash;yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened to them&mdash;therefore Alma thought it was expedient they should try the virtue of the word of God&rdquo; (Alma 31:5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the latter-day Prophets I have known has counseled the members of the Church to &ldquo;feast upon the words of Christ&rdquo; and to &ldquo;try the virtue of the word of God.&rdquo; &nbsp;Let us review some of their teachings on these topics:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, each time I met with President Thomas S. Monson, he has shared the story of how he came to love the scriptures.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was my experience as a small boy&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to come under the influence of a most effective and inspired teacher who . . . taught us [from the scriptures] concerning the creation of the world, the Fall of Adam, [and] the atoning sacrifice of Jesus.&nbsp; She brought to her classroom as honored guests Moses, Joshua, Peter, Thomas, Paul, and, of course, Christ.&nbsp; Though we did not see them, we learned to love, honor, and emulate them . . . while [she] &lsquo;opened to us the scriptures?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley was a Prophet who practiced daily scripture study.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;I love to read the scriptures, and I try to do so consistently and repeatedly. . . I do not claim distinction as a scholar of the scriptures.&nbsp; For me, the reading of the scriptures is not the pursuit of scholarship.&nbsp; Rather it is a<strong> </strong>love affair with the word of the Lord and that of His prophets . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Hinckley was a practical man who said: &ldquo;I know that with the demands of daily living there is little time to read anything.&rdquo;&nbsp; But for those who would take the time, he gave this prophetic promise: &ldquo;. . . I promise you that if you will read . . . (the) scripture(s), there will come into your heart an understanding and a warmth that will be pleasing to experience.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of you will remember when President Hinckley invited all of us to read the Book of Mormon in 2005.&nbsp; With that invitation came this promise: &ldquo;. . . I promise you that if each of you will . . . read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes&rdquo; [1] &ldquo;an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord,&rdquo; [2] &ldquo;a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and&rdquo; [3] &ldquo;a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson was another Prophet whose ministry focused on getting members of the Church to read the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;I urge you to recommit yourselves to study of the scriptures.&nbsp; Immerse yourselves in them daily so you will have the power of the Spirit to attend you in your calling. . . [W]hen individual members and families immerse themselves in the scriptures regularly and consistently . . . Testimonies will increase.&nbsp; Commitment will be strengthened.&nbsp; Families will be fortified.&nbsp; Personal revelation will flow.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Always remember, there is no satisfactory substitute for the scriptures and the words of the living prophets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When President Spencer W. Kimball was serving as president of the Church, it was my privilege to be called to serve as his bishop.&nbsp; This close relationship gave me the opportunity to closely observe the importance of scriptures in his life.&nbsp; Often I would walk or drive by the Kimball home late at night where I noticed that the only light on in the Kimball home was the light in President Kimball&rsquo;s study.&nbsp; I knew that he was occupied in either studying the scriptures or writing in his personal journal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Kimball recommended the practice of &ldquo;Daily reading of the scriptures . . . as a powerful tool against ignorance and the temptations of Satan.&rdquo;&nbsp; In an<em> Ensign</em> article, President Kimball wrote: &ldquo;I am convinced that each of us, at least some time in our lives, must discover the scriptures for ourselvesCand not just discover them once, but rediscover them again and again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All through the scriptures&rdquo; President Kimball said, &ldquo;every weakness and strength of man has been portrayed, and rewards and punishments have been recorded.&nbsp; One would surely be blind who could not learn to live life properly by such reading . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Kimball found that the scriptures were a bridge connecting him to his Heavenly Father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I find,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away.&nbsp; If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Key No. 2 is one of the most common <em>themes</em> in all of scripture and is reflected in this passage from the Sermon on the Mount when Jesus said, &ldquo;Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. . .&rdquo; (Matthew 7:7).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar, but slightly different version of this theme is this one found in the Doctrine and Covenants: &ldquo;<em>Seek</em> me diligently and ye shall find me; <em>ask</em>, and ye shall receive; <em>knock</em>, and it shall be opened unto you&rdquo; (D&amp;C 88:63).&nbsp; Similar passages are also found in the Old Testament; the New Testament; the Book of Mormon; the Pearl of Great Price and in more than a hundred places throughout the scriptures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These scriptures describe the Lord&rsquo;s divine pattern for receiving personal revelation.&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s promise to those who will &ldquo;ask&rdquo;, &ldquo;knock&rdquo; and &ldquo;seek&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;in faith, nothing wavering&rdquo;&mdash;that they would enjoy these promises:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . everyone that <em>asketh </em>receiveth,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . he that <em>seeketh</em> findeth,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . to him that <em>knocketh</em> it shall be opened&rdquo; (See Matthew 7:8; Luke 11:10; and 3 Nephi 14:8, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These same promises from the New Testament and the Book of Mormon were renewed in this dispensation when the Lord through the Prophet Joseph restated this same theme, but added clarity by stating exactly what would be received: &ldquo;If thou shalt<em> ask</em>, thou shalt <em>receive</em> <em>revelation</em> upon revelation, <em>knowledge</em> upon knowledge, that thou mayest <em>know</em> the mysteries and peaceable things&mdash;that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal&rdquo; (D&amp;C 42:61, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The commandment to &ldquo;ask,&rdquo; &ldquo;seek&rdquo; and &ldquo;knock&rdquo; is not merely an academic exercise, but a process that can lead to our receiving personal revelation.&nbsp; Elder Bruce R. McConkie said, &ldquo;I sometimes think that one of the bestâkept secrets of the kingdom is that the scriptures open the door to the receipt of revelation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The classic example of how Key No. 2 works is to examine the life of Joseph Smith and the unfolding of the Restoration of the gospel.&nbsp; This dispensation commenced in the spring of 1820, when an untutored 14 year old boy, read the familiar Bible passage in the first chapter of James.&nbsp; The familiar passage read: &ldquo;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him&rdquo; (James 1:5).&nbsp; Joseph&rsquo;s response to this scripture was to do exactly as James directed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First&mdash;<strong>Joseph read the scriptures:</strong> He tells us: &ldquo;I was one day<em> reading</em> the Epistle of James . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second&mdash;<strong>Joseph felt the influence of the Spirit as he read:</strong>&nbsp; He writes: &ldquo;Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine.&nbsp; It seemed to enter with great force into <em>every feeling of my heart</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third&mdash;<strong>Joseph pondered on the scripture:</strong><em>&nbsp; </em>He said: &ldquo;I reflected on it<em> again </em>and<em> again . .</em> .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth&mdash;<strong>Joseph made the decision to ask</strong>:&nbsp; He declared: &ldquo;At length <em>I came to the conclusion</em> that I . . . must do as James directs, that is, <em>ask of God</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifth&mdash;<strong>Joseph prayed to God:</strong>&nbsp; He recorded: &ldquo;So, in accordance with . . . <em>my determination to ask</em> of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt&rdquo; (JS-History 1:11-14, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is not this the same heavenly pattern that each of us can follow as we <em>read the scriptures</em>,&nbsp; <em>feel</em> the Spirit as it touches our hearts,&nbsp; <em>ponder what we have studied</em>,&nbsp; then&nbsp; <em>pray</em> to God for wisdom and knowledge each time we open the scriptures?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result of Joseph Smith&rsquo;s reading, pondering and praying led him into the Sacred Grove where the heavens opened and he received a personal revelation from the Father and the Son.&nbsp; The events leading to the First Vision set the pattern for other visitations which followed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that the visitation by Moroni in 1823, and by John the Baptist in 1829, came as a result of Joseph&rsquo;s initiating the process of seeking personal revelation by &ldquo;asking,&rdquo; &ldquo;seeking&rdquo; and &ldquo;knocking&rdquo;&mdash;being hungry to know more about the things of God.&nbsp; Peter, James, and John and a host of other heavenly messengers numbering in the scores were sent to Joseph Smith.&nbsp; These heaven-sent messengers revealed ancient records, restored priesthood powers, conferred important keys, explained sacred ordinances, and fulfilled biblical prophecies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We learn from latter-day revelation that the Holy Ghost is a member of the Godhead and &ldquo;. . . is a personage of Spirit. &nbsp;Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us&rdquo; (D&amp;C 130:22).&nbsp; Joseph was told that &ldquo;A man may receive the Holy Ghost, and it may descend upon him and not tarry with him&rdquo; (D&amp;C 130:23).&nbsp; Our task is to ensure that the influence of the Holy Ghost, which is often referred to as a &ldquo;still small voice,&rdquo; remains with us.&nbsp; (See 1 Kings 19:9-12).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer explains how this works: &ldquo;The Holy Ghost speaks with a voice that you <em>feel </em>more than you <em>hear</em>. . . While we speak of &lsquo;listening&rsquo; to the whisperings of the Spirit, most often one describes a spiritual prompting by saying, &lsquo;I had a feeling. . .&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He continues: &ldquo;This voice of the Spirit speaks gently, prompting you what to do or what to say, or it may caution or warn you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Monson tells us that when we feel the promptings of the Holy Ghost, we should &ldquo;Open your hearts, even your very souls, to the sound of that special voice that testifies of truth. . . Be influenced by that still, small voice.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we want the Holy Ghost to become our constant companion, we must live a righteous life so that the Holy Ghost will be comfortable dwelling with us and in us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several years following his martyrdom, Joseph Smith appeared to President Brigham Young with this message: &ldquo;Tell the people to . . . keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right.&nbsp; Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach you what to do and where to go. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Brethren have taught us that one way to invite the Holy Ghost to be with us is to have a prayer in our heart as we study the scriptures.&nbsp; It is also appropriate to have a formal prayer either before, during or after our study.&nbsp; The reasons we pray as we read the scriptures is to enjoy the influence of the Spirit of Truth and to feel the comfort of the Comforter having the quiet assurance that the Holy Ghost &ldquo;will <em>show you all things what ye should do</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recall with me this lesson from Church History which shows the enlightening power of the Spirit.&nbsp; After Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery received the Aaronic Priesthood under the hand of John the Baptist and had baptized each other, Joseph writes:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately on our coming up out of the water . . . We were filled with the Holy Ghost. . . . Our minds being now enlightened, we began to have the scriptures laid open to our understandings, and the true meaning and intention of their more mysterious passages revealed unto us in a manner which we never could attain to previously, nor ever before had thought of. . .&rdquo; (JS-History 1:73-74).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parley P. Pratt describes what happens when a person is born of the Spirit and receives the Holy Ghost: &ldquo;His mind is quickened, his intellectual faculties are aroused to intense activity.&nbsp; He is, as it were, illuminated.&nbsp; He learns more of divine truth in a few days than he could have learned in a lifetime in the best . . . human institutions in the world.&rdquo;<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Over the last three decades, I have had the opportunity to meet with thousands of members of the Church located in more than 30 different countries.&nbsp; Many were your age and some were new in the Church.&nbsp; They would often ask me how they should study the scriptures.&nbsp; Let me share with you some of their most commonly asked questions and my response as I quoted to them these words of latter-day prophets and apostles:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 1&mdash;</strong>&ldquo;How long should we read, search and study the scriptures each day?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> President Ezra Taft Benson stated:&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed reading the scriptures and do so on a daily basis . . . I &ldquo;recommended studying (the Book of Mormon) half an hour each day (and) I commend that practice to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 2&mdash;&ldquo;</strong>How long does it take the average reader to read the entire Standard Works?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Elder Bruce R. McConkie said: &ldquo;We can read all of the Standard Works of the Church in one year if we proceed at the rate of about six pages a day.&nbsp; To do the sincere searching and the solemn pondering required will take more time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On one occasion I interviewed for baptism a very unusual 23 year old Russian investigator.&nbsp; She told me that in the weeks between meeting the missionaries and the day of her baptism, she had read the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and<em> A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</em> not once, but <em>twice. </em>&nbsp;I asked her: &ldquo;What prompted you to become such of voracious reader of the scriptures?&rdquo;&nbsp; She told me that once she picked up the Book of Mormon, she could not bear to put it down.&nbsp; She went without food and sleep to complete her reading.&nbsp; She confessed to me that each evening, she hurried home from work, picked up the Book of Mormon and read it until 4:00 a.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On one occasion I asked Elder Maxwell, how long he had spent reading the scriptures that morning.&nbsp; His answer surprised me and delighted me.&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;I spent 30 minutes this morning reading and searching a<em> single </em>verse.&nbsp; On another occasion I spent that much time pondering over the placement of a<em> single</em> comma.&rdquo;&nbsp; While you may be tempted to speed read the scriptures, slow down and ponder the meaning of each single verse and comma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 3&mdash;&ldquo;</strong>Is there a difference between <em>&ldquo;reading&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;searching&rdquo;</em> the scriptures?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Elder D. Todd Christofferson said studying (the scriptures) mean &ldquo;something more than reading.&rdquo;&nbsp; As you study (the scriptures), he recommends that you read &ldquo;a few verses, stopping to ponder them, carefully reading the verses again, and as you think about what they mean, praying for understanding, asking questions in your mind, waiting for spiritual impressions, and writing down the impressions and insights that come so you can remember and learn more.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Studying in this way,: he said, &ldquo;you may not read a lot of chapters or verses in a half hour, but you will be giving place in your heart for the word of God, and He will be speaking to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you stop and ponder the scriptures in your &ldquo;mind&rdquo; and &ldquo;heart&rdquo; here are some questions you may want to ask yourself while you study:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>!&nbsp;&nbsp; What <em>principle</em> or <em>doctrine</em> is the Lord teaching?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>!&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the Lord want me to <em>learn</em> from this verse?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>!&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the scripture teach something that will help me with a <em>problem</em>, <em>concern</em>, or <em>challenge</em> in my life?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>!&nbsp;&nbsp; How might the teachings found in this scripture help me in my responsibilities at <em>home</em>, school, or in my current Church <em>calling</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>!&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the Lord want me to <em>do</em> or <em>act upon</em> as a result of the things I have learned?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 4&mdash;&ldquo;</strong>What is the best and most effective way to study the scriptures?&rdquo;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; The &ldquo;best way&rdquo; to study the scriptures is to find the one that works best for you; however, always being open to new ideas from the Brethren and others.&nbsp; Elder David A. Bednar in a most interesting CES Fireside talk identified different ways to study the scriptures.&nbsp; These include: (1) &ldquo;R<em>eading</em> a book of scriptures from beginning to end. . .&rdquo; to study.<sup> </sup>&nbsp;(2) <em>&ldquo;Studying</em> the scriptures by <em>topic</em> . . .&rdquo;, and (3) &ldquo;S<em>earching</em> the scriptures for <em>connections, patterns, and themes.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp; I recommend that each of you reads Elder Bednar&rsquo;s talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 5&mdash;&ldquo;</strong>What can I do to form the habit of daily scripture study?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; President Henry B. Eyring said: &ldquo;The only way you can be sure that a busy schedule doesn&rsquo;t crowd out scripture study is to establish a regular time to study the scriptures.&nbsp; I have found&rdquo; he said &ldquo;that the beginning of the day and the end of the day are mine.&nbsp; Those times I can usually control . . . When . . . I break out of the pattern, it&rsquo;s hard on me.&nbsp; Once you get used to regular scripture study, you miss it if you don&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer suggests that the best time to study the scriptures is to follow the commandment &ldquo;to arise from your bed early&rdquo; (<a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/88/124#124" target="contentWindow">D&amp;C 88:124</a>) &ldquo;. . . when your mind is clear . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; The hard part about that, as some of can attest, is going to bed early.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Let me say a brief word about scripture memorization as part of your scripture study.&nbsp; We have in the Church a rich heritage from the early brethren who believed there was value in memorizing scriptures.&nbsp; Elder Orson Hyde memorized the entire Bible in both English and in Hebrew.&nbsp; It was said that you could read to him any verse of scripture and he would then, from memory, quote the verse before it and the verse that came after it as well as to give you the citation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charles W. Penrose, prior to age 20, had committed to memory most of the New Testament.&nbsp; Prior to his death at age 93, he had extended this scripture mastery to all of the Standard Works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While these brethren had a capacity and a commitment beyond most of ours, there are some basic scriptures, which, if committed to memory, allow us to speak and teach with greater power and authority as we have the ability to recall these scriptures at will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a young missionary in Scotland, I committed myself to memorize all of the scriptures used in the 15 missionary discussions then in use.&nbsp; When I had mastered these scriptures, I turned to memorizing longer passages of scripture such as the Ten Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, Paul&rsquo;s discourse on Charity, and Sections 4, 13, and 135 from the Doctrine and Covenants.&nbsp; I have never regretted that decision although it was hard at first to acquire the skill.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>In summary, today we have discussed three keys to understanding the scriptures:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key No. 1 admonishes you<strong> </strong>to &ldquo;<strong>feast upon the words of Christ</strong>. . .&rdquo; because &ldquo;the words of Christ will <strong><em>tell </em></strong>you <strong>all things</strong> what ye should <strong>do</strong>&rdquo; (2 Nephi 32.3, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I urge you to &ldquo;feast upon the words of Christ&rdquo; and immerse yourselves in the scriptures daily.&nbsp; If you have not started your &ldquo;love affair&rdquo; with the scriptures, decide to start today!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key No. 2 admonishes you to <strong>&ldquo;ask,&rdquo; &ldquo;seek&rdquo; and &ldquo;knock&rdquo; </strong>promising<strong> </strong>that<strong> </strong>that &ldquo;every one that asketh <em>receiveth</em>; and he that seeketh <em>findeth</em>; and to him that knocketh <em>it shall be opened</em>&rdquo; (Matthew 7:8, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that if you will &ldquo;ask,&rdquo; &ldquo;seek&rdquo; and &ldquo;knock&rdquo;<strong> </strong>there is spiritual knowledge and there are revelatory experiences that will come to you as you read, ponder and pray about the scriptures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key No. 3 admonishes you to &ldquo;<strong>receive the Holy Ghos</strong>t. . .&rdquo; because the Holy Ghost &ldquo;<strong>will show you all things what ye should do</strong>&rdquo; (2 Nephi 32:5, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that that as you read and study, your scriptures will become like a Liahona or a Urim and Thummim that will invite the Holy Ghost to attend you.&nbsp; They will open the door to personal revelation to give you direction and &ldquo;show you<em> all</em> things what ye should do&rdquo; as you seek His guidance in making the great decision of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, I testify that President Thomas S. Monson is the Lord&rsquo;s prophet, seer and revelator in our day.&nbsp; His prophetic words when speaking as God&rsquo;s Prophet become scripture to us and should be carefully followed.&nbsp; I thank him not only for his life-long &ldquo;love affair&rdquo; with the scriptures, but for his personal example in using the scriptures as a preacher and a teacher of righteousness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>As I speak to you this afternoon, I invite you to consider the various contexts in which we use the phrase &ldquo;being true and faithful&rdquo; in our gospel experience.&nbsp; It is used in the scriptures.&nbsp; It is used in our sacred hymns, as we have just sung.&nbsp; For those of you who have been to the temple, you recognize that it has a place in the endowment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I want to explore with you the doctrine of what it means to be true and faithful. After exploring that doctrine, I would like us to consider a practical approach to applying it in our lives &ndash; what can &ldquo;we&rdquo; do to be true and faithful?&nbsp; And, finally, I would like to review the promises that are ours if we are successful in our quest. Let&rsquo;s begin by reading in Revelations 19:11, 16.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.&rdquo; <sup>[i]</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus Christ &ndash; King of Kings and Lord of Lords &ndash; then, is called true and faithful by John the Revelator.&nbsp; He is the embodiment or the exemplar of what it means to be true and faithful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s consider the definition of the adjective &ldquo;TRUE.&rdquo; There is an especially meaningful definition of this word &ldquo;true&rdquo; in the Greek dictionary, where it expresses the meaning of the word &ldquo;alethinos.&rdquo; Please pay special attention to this definition:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which has not only the name and the resemblance, but the real nature &ndash; corresponding to the name in every respect, corresponding to the idea signified by the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I read that definition, it seems to me that the person who wrote it could, perhaps, have been reading in the Book of Mormon, where Mosiah asks us about having the Savior&rsquo;s image engraven in our countenance?&nbsp; We will revisit this definition several times this afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the background for this doctrinal discussion, let us travel back together in our minds&rsquo; eye to the pre-existence &ndash; to a time when Heavenly Father asked: &ldquo;Whom shall I send?&rdquo; As spirit children of celestial parents, we had come to the point at which we had to anticipate a period of mortal separation from our Heavenly Parents and from our lives as they had been in their presence. We were excited for the opportunity to experience mortality and we shouted for joy when it was explained to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Heavenly Father&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;Whom shall I send?&rdquo; two diametrically opposite plans were proposed. One was a plan of compulsion and the other was a plan based on the principles of agency and personal choice.&nbsp; It was at that moment when there began to be &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; in all things &ndash; good and evil, light and darkness, truth and lies, joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain. It is true that we had agency, but until that moment, there had never been &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; &ndash; not until Lucifer chose to openly oppose Christ and his plan. And, from the moment in which God made the decision to send His beloved son, Jesus Christ, to be our Savior and Redeemer, rejecting Lucifer&rsquo;s plan of compulsion and self glorification, the following sequence of events began to unfold for the rest of us:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We learned that Jesus Christ, has never done anything that He has not already seen His Father do. In John 5:19, we read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do: for what things soever He (the Father) doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>[ii]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus, who is True and Faithful, defers to His Father and gives Him all glory and honor for everything that He does. He willingly submits to the will of His Father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Father and I are one.&nbsp; I am in the Father and the Father in me; and inasmuch as ye have received me, ye are in me and I in you.&rdquo;<sup> </sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>[iii]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this verse, we learn that there is a three-way, symbiotic relationship in which God the Father, Jesus Christ, and we are all interconnected through the gospel plan, through our spiritual DNA, and through our divine potential. This is in part what it means when the scriptures tell us that we have the capacity to become joint heirs with Christ to &ldquo;all that the Father hath.&rdquo; It also applies to the scriptural declaration by God that his work and his glory are to bring to pass our immortality and our eternal life, which is to say that he strives to help us live the life that he now lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having focused first on the meaning of &ldquo;true,&rdquo; we can begin to understand what it means to be faithful when we read in Section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 19 and 20:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness. For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>[iv]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another truth that we learned in the pre-existence was that, when our brothers and sisters &ndash; fully one third of them &ndash; exercised their agency poorly and rebelled against Christ&rsquo;s Plan of Happiness &ndash; in making that choice, they lost the opportunity to ever gain a body, to progress any further, and they, with Satan, were cast out of heaven.&nbsp; In that act of rebellion, they became the instruments through which we are tempted and tried while here on the earth. They are our opposition. Their purpose is to spread darkness, lies, infidelity, fear and persecution. And they are happiest when they can thwart or frustrate anything related to Jesus&rsquo; plan of happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You and I participated actively in the war caused by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. By doing that, we &ldquo;kept our first estate&rdquo; and it was then that, for the first time, we took upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. In that war, the sides were clearly identified and we experienced what it means to have &ldquo;opposition in all things.&rdquo; Our standard or banner was one of truth, light, faithfulness, humility and doing the will of our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; The captain of our host was Jesus Christ &ndash; whose name is &ldquo;True and Faithful,&rdquo; as we read in the Book of Revelations. Remember how John the Revelator described him as riding on a white horse and waging war?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standard or banner of the opposition was &ndash; and still is &ndash; one of lies, darkness, infidelity, pride, sin, and selfishness. We learn that Satan &ndash; their captain &ndash; is the &ldquo;father of all lies;&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>[v]</sup></a> that he loves darkness and is an enemy to the light. In Section 82 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 5, we read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch, for the adversary spreadeth his dominions, and darkness reigneth.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>[vi]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 3 Nephi 27:27 the Savior poses this question, which pertains to the expectations that he has for each of us during mortality:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, what manner of men (and women) ought ye to be? Verily, I say unto you, even as I am.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>[vii]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This admonition, to become &ldquo;like&rdquo; the Savior, is not a metaphor. It is the pattern by which we measure the success of our efforts in this, our second estate. Satan would have you believe that it is not something to be taken literally &ndash; because if he can convince you that Jesus Christ is just too perfect; if he can convince you that you can never become that good; if he can convince you that, for you, &ldquo;close enough is good enough,&rdquo; he can cause you to lower your standards and to accept something less than the Savior would have you be. Do not fall for this deception!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pre-existence, when we took upon ourselves for the first time the name of Jesus Christ, we learned that our central mission in mortality would be twofold &ndash; first, to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ again here in mortality and, second, to acquire His attributes as we prepare to become joint heirs with him to all that the Father hath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; In the 88<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, verses 6 and 11, we read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He (Jesus Christ) that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, in that he comprehendeth all things, that he might be in all and through all things, the light of truth; And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings;&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>[viii]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you noticed how often the attributes of light and truth appear together in the scriptures?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>[ix]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And behold, I am the light and the life of the world.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>[x]</sup></a><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Light and truth are inseparable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, light and truth are synonymous.&nbsp; They are fundamental elements that are always in balance &ndash; especially as they reflect the divine attributes of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife, Joyce, is a master gardener.&nbsp; She loves plants and her gardens are places of beauty.&nbsp; Those of you who know her know that she loves beautiful flowers and fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; Each year, in the fall, she carefully brings inside the house a selection of flowers that she protects and nourishes through the winter so that they can be propagated into next year&rsquo;s foundation plantings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last winter she brought several large geraniums inside to care for them. We placed one of these plants by our patio door, where it could receive as much light as possible.&nbsp; Within just a few hours, the leaves of this geranium began to turn toward the light. Over the course of the winter months, the side of the plant that received more light grew lush and healthy, while the side that faced away from the light did not thrive nearly as well. Scripturally, you might say that it did not &ldquo;abound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why? Remember in Doctrine and Covenants 88:13?&nbsp; Christ is the light that is in all things, which giveth life to all things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You and I are just like that geranium.&nbsp; We seek the light because it gives us life. We turn to it and are &ldquo;quickened&rdquo; by it.&nbsp; To &ldquo;be quickened&rdquo; means that we thrive and grow in its presence. It was important for us to regularly turn the geranium so that the entire plant thrived and was quickened by the light. Might I suggest that, in our own self-evaluations, we consider what areas of our lives need more light and seek diligently through repentance, study, prayer and spiritual activity to gain the light that we need to abound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I caution you: do not be deceived by the adversary. This light is not a metaphor. It is real. To the extent that you and I embrace the light &ndash; which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God &ndash; and are warmed by its rays, two things happen to us. First, we take in light ourselves and become more like Jesus Christ, and, second, we have our intelligence &ldquo;quickened.&rdquo; &ldquo;And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings.&rdquo; To have your &ldquo;understanding quickened by the light of Christ&rdquo; is one of the reasons why your choice to attend BYU&ndash;Idaho was so important. The Lord&rsquo;s university is a place from which light emanates because his spirit is here. You are here to take in as much light and truth as you possibly can. Light and truth abound here, if you are open to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Five years ago, Elder James E. Faust told the following story: &ldquo;I recently recalled a historic meeting in Jerusalem about 17 years ago. (Which would have been in 1988.) It was regarding the lease for the land on which the Brigham Young University&rsquo;s Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies was later built. Before this lease could be signed, President Ezra Taft Benson and Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, then president of Brigham Young University, agreed with the Israeli government on behalf of the Church and the university not to proselyte in Israel. You might wonder why we agreed not to proselyte. We were required to do so in order to get the building permit to build that magnificent building which stands in the historic city of Jerusalem. To our knowledge the Church and BYU have scrupulously and honorably kept that nonproselyting commitment. After the lease had been signed, one of our friends (I believe that it was Teddy Kolleck, Mayor of Jerusalem) insightfully remarked, &lsquo;Oh, we know that you are not going to proselyte, but what are you going to do about the light that is in their eyes?&rsquo; He was referring to our students who were studying in Israel.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>[xi]</sup></a><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look closely at one another. If you could see what your bishops see, or your stake presidents see, or what anyone who holds the keys of ecclesiastical stewardship sees, you too would discern the light of Christ that is growing within you through the Holy Ghost. As members of the Church, we have been given the special gift of the Holy Ghost to help us to both discern and accumulate light.&nbsp; &nbsp;People who are not members of the Church can discern the light within you, as did this friend of the Church in Jersualem &ndash; even though they may not be able to correctly identify its source or its meaning.&nbsp; It is real. It is something to be sought after diligently. When you have it, or begin to have it, it is something to cherish and to protect with all of your soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul Harvey, a famous news commentator, visited one of our Church school campuses some years ago. Following that visit, he observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each &hellip; young face mirrored a sort of &hellip; sublime assurance. These days many young eyes are prematurely old from countless compromises with conscience. But [these young people] have that enviable headstart which derives from discipline, dedication, and consecration.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>[xii]</sup></a></p>
<p>To be faithful, then, is to be obedient and diligent in keeping the commandments of God.&nbsp; Consider that the word &ldquo;faithful&rdquo; means &ldquo;full of faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elder Bruce R. MConkie, in Mormon Doctrine, teaches us that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith is a gift of God, bestowed as a reward for personal righteousness.&nbsp; It is always given when righteousness is present, and the greater the measure of obedience (that we demonstrate) to God&rsquo;s laws, the greater will be the endowment of faith (that is bestowed.)&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>[xiii]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, let us briefly review the points of the doctrine of being true and faithful:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the problems that we face as we work out our salvation and seek to become more like the Savior is the tendency to view our mortal probationary period as somehow disconnected from the rest of eternity.&nbsp; In that regard, President Brigham Young provides the following counsel:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no life more precious than the present life which we enjoy; there is no life that is worth any more to us than this life is. It may be said that an eternal life is worth more. We are in eternity, and all that we have to do is to take the road that lead into the eternal lives. Eternal life is an inherent quality of the creature, and nothing but sin can put a termination to it.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>[xiv]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this life, then, we learn and grow, line upon line and precept upon precept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lest we become discouraged with the size and difficulty of becoming like Christ, He knew that in our &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; we would sometimes &ndash; perhaps even &ldquo;often&rdquo; fall short and make a mistake. He knew that would happen, so he provided prayer as a means for us to reconnect with him and seek his help.&nbsp; He provided repentance as a means of making mid-course corrections, and he provided the Holy Ghost as a constant guide and companion to coach and advise us along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a devotional address in 2002, Brother Dennis L. Largey, Associate Professor of Ancient Scripture at BYU, explained the relationship between faithfulness and obedience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When light is diminished in our lives, motivation toward spiritual things also diminishes to one degree or another. We are less exact in our commandment keeping and less dedicated to activities such as home teaching, Church attendance, temple attendance, scripture reading, and prayer--the very things that intensify light in our lives. With insufficient light we are more susceptible to temptation, and like a plant without the nourishment of the light of the sun, without the nourishment of the light of the Son of God, we can also weaken and shrivel and eventually die spiritually.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>[xv]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you have that same light in your countenances.&nbsp; Having it is a living testimony that you are worthy and that you are taking in truth and light and becoming like the Savior. You might say that you are becoming like him &ldquo;line upon line&rdquo; and &ldquo;lumen upon lumen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to focus this afternoon on two gospel principles adherence to which will increase our capacity to be true and faithful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>King Mosiah taught:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>[xvi]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate this principle, let me share with you the words of President Henry B. Eyring on this subject from April Conference 2006:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like you, I have felt what King Benjamin meant when he said that we could become like a little child before God. I have prayed, as you have, to know what to do when choices that I faced would have eternal consequences. Over many years I have seen a recurring pattern in the times when the answers to such a prayer have come most clearly.</p>
<p>Once, for instance, I prayed through the night to know what I was to choose to do in the morning. I knew that no other choice could have had a greater effect on the lives of others and on my own. I knew what choice looked most comfortable to me. I knew what outcome I wanted. But I could not see the future. I could not see which choice would lead to which outcome. So the risk of being wrong seemed too great to me.</p>
<p>I prayed, but for hours there seemed to be no answer. Just before dawn, a feeling came over me. More than at any time since I had been a child, I felt like one. My heart and my mind seemed to grow very quiet. There was a peace in that inner stillness.</p>
<p>Somewhat to my surprise, I found myself praying, &ldquo;Heavenly Father, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I want. I don&rsquo;t care anymore what I want. I only want that Thy will be done. That is all that I want. Please tell me what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that moment I felt as quiet inside as I had ever felt. And the message came, and I was sure who it was from. It was clear what I was to do. I received no promise of the outcome. There was only the assurance that I was a child who had been told what path led to whatever He wanted for me.</p>
<p>I learned from that experience and countless repetitions that the description of the Holy Ghost as a still, small voice is real&hellip;.Only when my heart has been still and quiet, in submission like a little child, has the Spirit been clearly audible to my heart and mind.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>[xvii]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christ taught: Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.&nbsp; When we talk about being joint heirs with Christ and inheriting &ldquo;all that the Father hath,&rdquo; we should remember that what we are inheriting is the Celestial Kingdom, or the life that our Heavenly Father now has. This earth, once it is celestialized, is our destiny. It is our Celestial Kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark, in a devotional address given from this pulpit in January 2006, taught us that we must be diligent in the small things. He said at that time:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to talk today about principles that are central to the special character of BYU&ndash;Idaho, and central to your lives now, and to the glorious future that awaits you. These principles are laid out in a beautiful and powerful way in the 64<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Let&rsquo;s turn to that section and read together verses 33 and 34:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great. Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days.&rsquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>[xviii]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s translate these principles and President Clark&rsquo;s counsel into an introspective plan of action that will lead us to greater faithfulness and the accumulation of more personal light and truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider, for instance the Honor Code that we have each committed to obey.&nbsp; The Honor Code is a minimum standard &ndash; a baseline, if you will.&nbsp; President Clark has asked us to raise the bar and to have our personal comportment here be at a higher level than the Honor Code. &nbsp;Please answer these questions for yourself:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I obey the Honor Code cheerfully, or do I grumble and complain about its particulars?</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I honorably uphold the commitment that I made to my bishop when he endorsed me to attend BYU&ndash;Idaho?</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I obedient to the spirit of modesty and grooming that are integral to the Honor Code?</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brethren, did you shave today? Do you shave every day?</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I willingly obey the spirit of the curfew?</p>
<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I attend my Church meetings? All of them? Am I on time?</p>
<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the spirit in my apartment? Do I treat my roommates with respect and dignity?&nbsp; Is there anyone in my apartment who gets treated less respectfully? Is there ever a spirit of contention there?</p>
<p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I a diligent and faithful home teacher or visiting teacher?&nbsp;</p>
<p>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I have a calling in my ward? Do I fulfill that calling faithfully?</p>
<p>10)&nbsp; &nbsp;How often am I AWOL from my campus ward on Sundays?</p>
<p>11)&nbsp; &nbsp;Does my language reflect the level of light and truth that I desire to have?</p>
<p>12)&nbsp; &nbsp;Do I ever take food that doesn&rsquo;t belong to me?</p>
<p>13)&nbsp; &nbsp;Am I irritated when someone preaches to me about the Honor Code?</p>
<p>14)&nbsp; &nbsp;Do I willingly keep the Sabbath day holy?</p>
<p>15)&nbsp; &nbsp;Do I have a current temple recommend and do I worship there often?</p>
<p>16)&nbsp; &nbsp;Do I attend devotional services?</p>
<p>17)&nbsp; &nbsp;Am I quick to repent when I have fallen short in my commandment keeping, or do I seek to rationalize, minimize and blame others?</p>
<p>18)&nbsp; &nbsp;Do I savor the opportunity to partake of the sacrament each week and to renew my covenants with Heavenly Father?</p>
<p>19)&nbsp; &nbsp;Do I seek to stand in holy places?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate the principle of faithfulness, I would like to tell you about an experience that our family had with my mother when she was in the hospital just before she died.&nbsp; Mother was 92 years old and had lived a long and faithful life.&nbsp; She and we knew that she would not be healed this time and we were preparing together for her passing.&nbsp; Her calling in the Church had, for several years, been as a visiting teaching supervisor.&nbsp; She expressed concern to us that she had not called all of her visiting teachers yet that month so that she could make her report on time. She asked for our help in making that happen.&nbsp; And later that afternoon, just before she died, she looked at us and asked: &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;ve done enough?&rdquo; &ndash; meaning, &ldquo;is it okay for me to go now?&rdquo;&nbsp; I cherish my mother&rsquo;s example of faithful service right to the end of her life. &nbsp;Never give up. Serve the Lord for as long as you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we consider the two companion principles of becoming submissive and of being more exact in our commandment keeping, they are sufficient to help us decipher the &ldquo;set of our hearts.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that an interesting phrase?&nbsp; &ldquo;The set of our hearts.&rdquo; Elder Neal A. Maxwell described &ldquo;the set of our hearts&rdquo; in slightly different words. He called it &ldquo;Turning away from the world and toward God, toward home&hellip; and it represents the first tentative steps, as Peter explains in 1 Corinthians 2:16, in the process of beginning to develop &ldquo;the mind of Christ.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>[xix]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process of developing the mind of Christ, means the same thing as Mosiah&rsquo;s admonition that we &ldquo;receive his image in our countenances.&rdquo;&nbsp; As we turn away from darkness and embrace the light, we literally &ldquo;develop the mind of Christ&rdquo; and begin to receive his image in our countenances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the screen is a picture of the Argus C3 Camera that I took with me on my mission to Brazil. It was big and bulky and not automated in any way.&nbsp; I had to buy 35-mm film for it and protect that film from exposure to the light and moisture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also took with me a light meter, without which my exposures would have been</p>
<p>only guesses &ndash; and my mission photos would have been chronically over-exposed or under-exposed.&nbsp; I would aim this light meter at the subject of my intended photo and it would tell me how much light was emanating from my subject and how far to open or close my lens for a good photograph.&nbsp; Of course, much has changed for the better since that time and you now have fully automatic digital cameras that are almost always focused correctly and adjusted perfectly to the light. They don&rsquo;t require film and they focus automatically. Even our cell phones often have photographic capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a true principle that we can learn from this light meter. It is that, when we finish our second estate and have accumulated all of the light and truth that we possibly can; when we are &ldquo;finished,&rdquo; I believe that the process of being judged in the final judgment will be one of measuring the level of our accumulated light and assigning us to a kingdom with which we and our light and truth are compatible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, like the camera, as we become more exact in our commandment keeping and more submissive to the will of our Father, our ability to perceive the light and to seek it and make it a part of us through the Holy Ghost is enhanced. In a very real sense, our systems &ndash; like those of the camera over time &ndash; are becoming better, more refined, more exact.&nbsp; We are better instruments in the hands of a loving Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness. That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light growth brighter and brighter until the perfect day. And again, verily I say unto you, and I say it that you may know the truth, that you may chase darkness from among you;&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn20" target="_self"><sup>[xx]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to read to you from the words of Elder B.H. Roberts, one of the early apostles in this dispensation.&nbsp; He expressed this process of becoming true and faithful in these words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who so walks in the light and wisdom and power of God, will at the last, by the very force of association, make the light and wisdom and power of God his own &ndash; weaving those bright rays into a (divine) chain, linking himself forever to God and God to him.&nbsp; This is the sum of the Messiah&rsquo;s mystic words, &lsquo;Thou father, in me, and I in thee&rsquo; &ndash; beyond this, human greatness cannot achieve.&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>[xxi]</sup></a><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ. With Heavenly Father, He is the author of the great Plan of Happiness. Part of that plan is for each of us to seek his divine attributes. We can accomplish this during this lifetime, if we, like him, are true and faithful. You have divine potential. You can become a joint heir with Christ to everything that Heavenly Father has and is. I promise you that as you seek to be humble and to be more exact in keeping the commandments, you will accumulate light and truth. Of this I bear testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>I never cease to stand all amazed at the miracle the Lord has enacted and continues to bring forth at Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho.&nbsp; At this pulpit as I look over this large congregation and into your faces, it is clear to me that this facility has been constructed at this time and in this place for reasons we do not yet fully comprehend or understand.&nbsp; As &ldquo;we wait upon the Lord&rdquo; (Isaiah 40:31), His purposes will be revealed and accomplished&mdash;and you and I will declare that indeed The Lord is able to do His own work (see 2 Nephi 27: 21).&nbsp; This dedicatory service today truly is historic, and you will one day tell your children and grandchildren that you were present when this remarkable facility was dedicated by President Henry B. Eyring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Repetition helps us learn.&nbsp; Important truths and lessons are repeated frequently in the scriptures, in the messages of the living apostles and prophets, and in many of our daily experiences.&nbsp; Please permit me now to repeat several key elements of a warning and a promise that I expressed during the groundbreaking service for this building and the addition to the Manwaring Center on October 31, 2006.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the day ever were to come that intellectual arrogance, a lack of appreciation, and a spirit of demanding entitlement take root on this campus&mdash;among the students, faculty, employees, the administration, or within the community&mdash;then in that day, the Spirit of Ricks will be well on the way to being extinguished&mdash;and the heavenly influence and blessings that have prospered this institution and the people associated with it will be withdrawn.&nbsp; Conversely, as long as intellectual modesty, humility, gratitude, obedience, and frugality continue to characterize those who learn and serve at and who support BYU&ndash;Idaho, then this university will shine forth ever brighter as a beacon of righteousness and of inspired educational innovation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, please do not take for granted or become complacent about the spiritual and temporal blessings that have been poured out upon this campus.&nbsp; Today and always, please have a grateful heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thank Latter-day Saints from all over the world whose faithfulness in obeying the law of tithing makes your experience at this university possible.&nbsp; I express my appreciation to and admiration for all of the people and organizations that have contributed in any way to the successful completion of the BYU&ndash;Idaho Center and the Manwaring Center.&nbsp; Mostly importantly, I acknowledge our loving Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son for their bounteous blessings and tender mercies&mdash;in our individual lives and at this great university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am privileged to be the first member of the Quorum of the Twelve to bear my testimony in the BYU&ndash;Idaho Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I declare my apostolic witness of the reality and divinity of God the Eternal Father and of his Only Begotten Son, even Jesus the Christ.&nbsp; I know and witness that they live, that they know us as individuals, and that they speak today.&nbsp; I testify Jesus Christ is our Redeemer and Savior.&nbsp; His true Church has been restored to the earth in these latter days through the Prophet Joseph Smith.&nbsp; And a resurrected and living Savior directs the affairs of His living Church through a living prophet, even President Thomas S. Monson.&nbsp; With my love and with all of the energy of my soul, I witness these things are true, in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Sister Wendy Nelson and I are delighted to be with you on this historic occasion.&nbsp; We thank President Henry B. Eyring for this opportunity and privilege to be with him, Sister Eyring, and with each of you.&nbsp; We are also grateful to be with my associate in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Elder David A. Bednar, and his dear wife, Susan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This institution has had many outstanding presidents. Since the year 1971, it has been my privilege to work closely with six great men inaugurated as presidents of this institution.&nbsp; You know of their greatness and their goodness. &nbsp;They are Henry B. Eyring, Bruce C. Hafen, Joe J. Christensen, Steven D. Bennion, David A. Bednar, and Kim B. Clark.&nbsp; We are honored to be among them here today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this day of the dedication of the new BYU-Idaho Center, you could each take this opportunity to rededicate yourselves to the same principles that have made these presidents such great individuals.&nbsp; They follow the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; As they emulate Him, they likewise set examples worthy of our emulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though they come from different backgrounds in life, they have each become disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; They have taken His holy name upon them.&nbsp; Willingly and submissively, they have allowed their will to be swallowed up in the will of the Lord.&nbsp; Among their many shared virtues, perhaps I could identify four attributes that we can apply in our own lives.&nbsp; They and their eternal companions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>P</strong>ray regularly</p>
<p>$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>R</strong>egard other people respectfully</p>
<p>$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; </em><strong>S</strong>tudy spiritual and secular subjects symmetrically, and</p>
<p>$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> </em><strong>T</strong>ithe faithfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can easily remind yourself of these attributes by remembering four letters of the alphabet.&nbsp; They are <em>p</em>, <em>r</em>, <em>s</em>, and tCstanding for <em>p</em>ray, <em>r</em>egard, <em>s</em>tudy, and <em>t</em>ithe.&nbsp; You know these topics very well.&nbsp; And I know these men and their companions very well.&nbsp; I know them well enough to know that they are truly diligent in their commitment to pray regularly, to regard other people respectfully, to study spiritual and secular subjects symmetrically (in proper balance), and to tithe faithfully.&nbsp; As you apply these attributes in your own lives, as they have in theirs, you will also be blessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highest hope in their heartsCand in yoursCfor joy and success here and hereafter is enabled by developing an unshakable faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; This life can be mighty frightening at times, with its challenges, surprises, and heavy trials.&nbsp; Now is the time to fortify your faith.&nbsp; Believe in God.&nbsp; Believe in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Believe in the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Believe in your capacity to be strengthened and sustained by them even through your darkest hours of despair.&nbsp; Listen to these words of the Lord, as recorded in Section 98 of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AVerily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AWaiting patiently on the Lord, for your prayers have entered into the ears of the Lord . . . , and are recorded with this seal and testamentCthe Lord hath sworn and decreed that they shall be granted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ATherefore, he giveth this promise unto you, with an immutable covenant that they shall be fulfilled; . . . all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my name's glory, saith the Lord. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ponder that incredible promise!&nbsp; The Lord chose the strongest words to certify his intent.&nbsp; Your prayers are recordedCwith a seal and testamentCsworn and decreed with an immutable covenantCthat your afflictions will accrue to your good, and be certified by His holy name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later in that same section, this promise of the Lord is extended to the posterity of His faithful children.&nbsp; Listen to this remarkable promise: AI, the Lord, would fight their battles, and their children's battles, and their children's children's,...to the third and fourth generation. <sup>2</sup>&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, that promise can also be yours, through your faithfulness!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that God lives.&nbsp; Jesus is the Christ.&nbsp; His Church has been restored.&nbsp; President Thomas S. Monson is His presiding Apostle today.&nbsp; As you follow the Lord and His leaders in His Church and in this University, you will be blessed now and forever more.&nbsp; I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the assignment from President Thomas S. Monson to be with you today.&nbsp; I always feel blessed to represent him and to testify of the keys he holds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am particularly grateful to return to Rexburg for the dedication of two remarkable facilities, this BYU-Idaho Center and the newly remodeled and greatly expanded Manwaring Center.&nbsp; The dedication of these buildings is an important event for at least two reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, they represent vast contributions of time, effort, and tithes.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Today we honor and express our appreciation to all who have sacrificed to make the construction of these facilities possible.&nbsp; So today we give thanks to more people than we can name for more acts of personal dedication than we can describe or measure.&nbsp;&nbsp; My earnest hope is that they can feel today that their offering is gratefully accepted and will be remembered for generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have an additional opportunity today.&nbsp; These structures, significant in their own right, are also symbolic.&nbsp; They were approved by the Board of Education, which is chaired by the President of Church, for special reasons.&nbsp; They are central to the mission of a university that has a vital role to play in the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am blessed to know personally some of the history of this institution.&nbsp; I first came to Ricks College in the summer of 1971.&nbsp; In the preceding decade, the campus had more than tripled in size.&nbsp; Yet it was still small relative to what we see today.&nbsp; The ground on which this building stands was a baseball field.&nbsp; The Manwaring Center was roughly one-third of its current size.&nbsp; Each morning and evening, I passed between the Manwaring Center and the baseball field as I walked to and from our temporary home in a student trailer court, located at what was then the remote southwest edge of the campus.&nbsp; My office in those days was in the old Spori Building, built seventy years earlier by pioneering Saints in their poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was then, as now, an unusual feeling here which came from people more than from facilities.&nbsp; It came from students, employees, and citizens of Rexburg and the surrounding towns who wanted something more than secular learning and social experiences here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I arrived the college was small enough that the president was privileged to shake the hand of every new student as he or she registered for classes.&nbsp; For three days each Fall, I stood in the Hart Building, immediately north of us, shaking the hands and looking into the eyes of the students.&nbsp; None of them was perfect; some young women needed encouragement to dress more modestly, and I invited some of the young men to visit with a barber we had onsite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, in a remarkably large fraction of those eyes, I could see a special light.&nbsp; As never before in my life and rarely since, I felt that I was among covenant-makers who had gathered to a place where covenant-keeping was a collective priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my second year of shaking hands, I noticed that the lines of students were shorter and that we finished sooner.&nbsp; I confirmed that enrollment had in fact dropped and Baby Boom-demographics were likely to produce further declines.&nbsp; For the first time in more than twenty-five years, it appeared that the college would shrink rather than grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lessons about education and the Church I learned in the months that followed have guided my service since.&nbsp; Eager to seek counsel from the Board, I disclosed our projections for a steep drop in tuition income to the Commissioner of Education and to the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New as I was to my job, I knew the history of this institution and of the sponsorship of Church colleges by the Boards of Education over generations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ricks College had faced financial crisis many times.&nbsp; And every time the Board had expected the principal or the president to solve his own problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I was not surprised to be told to develop a plan for reducing the school&rsquo;s operating budget.&nbsp; Since by far the largest part of the budget was wages and salaries, it was clear that no plan would work without reducing the payroll.&nbsp; And that would mean the asking for terrible sacrifice by those who had given their lives and their hopes to the college and sacrifice for their families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After several painful weeks of counseling among ourselves, it was my duty to take a plan for salary cuts and staff reductions to the Commissioner and to the Board.&nbsp;&nbsp; To my great relief, which I can still feel today, I was thanked for our efforts and told that no salary cuts or layoffs would be necessary.&nbsp; The next Fall, enrollments inexplicably increased and remained at a level high enough that no further cost cutting became necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can now see some of the names of the people who might have been let go in that cost cutting plan that was never needed.&nbsp; They are listed in the Manwaring Center alcove where the university honors employees for careers of distinguished service.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are great blessings that come from following prophets in times of uncertainty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am often asked if I knew, as the president of Ricks College, what its future held.&nbsp; I did not see that the college would become the university it is today.&nbsp; There were only subtle impressions&mdash;feelings that this was a special place that needed to keep its spiritual standards high while staying close to its roots.&nbsp; I particularly felt the need to maintain our pioneer frugality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I felt the need too strongly.&nbsp; Members of the Board would occasionally ask, &ldquo;Hal, isn&rsquo;t there something more we could do for you up at Ricks College?&rdquo;&nbsp; They seemed to be worried that we wouldn&rsquo;t ask for enough.&nbsp; That was our heritage.&nbsp; We knew that it was the Lord&rsquo;s school, and that His work didn&rsquo;t depend on having the finest physical things.&nbsp; In fact, I worried that temporal blessings could distract us from the Lord&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; My vision and my determination was that Ricks College would continue to be His school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;was surprised, more than twenty years later when I was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve and Commissioner of Education, to be called into President Gordon B. Hinckley&rsquo;s office to discuss the possibility of Ricks College becoming a four-year university.&nbsp; It was obvious that he had already received revelation about the new university, including details such as a new name and a focus on undergraduate instruction.&nbsp; He had a plan to allow the college to give baccalaureate degrees while staying rooted in its foundation of humility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One year after President Hinckley&rsquo;s announcement that Ricks College would become BYU-Idaho, he assigned me to come and speak about the mission of the new university.&nbsp; I worked hard to prepare, feeling a dual burden.&nbsp; I knew both that the errand was from the Lord and that the people here might heed my words.&nbsp; After weeks of labor, I took a draft of my remarks to President Hinckley and gratefully received his suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, one week before the scheduled trip to Rexburg, terrorists attacked the World Trade Towers and the Pentagon.&nbsp; You may remember, as I do, feelings of doubt and even fear in those uncertain days after the attacks.&nbsp; Yet I observed none of those emotions among the members of the First Presidency (President Hinckley, President Monson, and President Faust).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no postponement of my assignment.&nbsp; They confidently sent me here as planned, with encouragement to testify that change brings opportunities for getting better, for seeking inspiration and being blessed with innovation. &nbsp;That has always been true at this institution, and I was grateful for the Brethren&rsquo;s reminder that the pace of change in the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom will increase as His return becomes more imminent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four years ago, I was surprised yet again to learn of the Board&rsquo;s approval of these two buildings that we dedicate today.&nbsp; When, in the summer of 2000, President Hinckley announced the creation of BYU-Idaho, he projected that the school would grow in terms of students served.&nbsp; But he cited year-round operation and innovative instructional technologies as the primary means for enabling that growth.&nbsp; &ldquo;With some additions and modifications,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the physical facilities now in place in Rexburg are adequate to handle the new program.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, some changes to the campus will be necessary.&nbsp; However, they will be modest in nature and scope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because I remembered that statement clearly, I was amazed to learn not only how large this BYU-Idaho Center would be, but also how its size was determined.&nbsp; President Kim Clark and his administrative team, responding to an observation by President Monson in October 2005 that the Hart Auditorium seemed too small to meet the university&rsquo;s needs, boldly proposed a facility with capacity to seat 12,000, or nearly every student and employee simultaneously.&nbsp; The Board approved the proposal, and the BYU-Idaho team began their work in accordance with the approved project scope and timeline.&nbsp; However, one week later, President Hinckley called President Clark and said, &ldquo;I have a feeling that you need to make the auditorium bigger.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also suggested that the work be undertaken sooner than planned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The past four years have brought many unexpected changes, both on the construction sites of this building and the expanded Manwaring Center, and in the world at large.&nbsp; This BYU-Idaho Center, which seats 15,000 rather than the 12,000 originally proposed, took longer to rise out of the ground and cost more than planned.&nbsp; In addition to having hard winters, Rexburg has hard ground.&nbsp; The early administrators and board members of Ricks College discovered that nearly one hundred years ago when they began to build a gymnasium with a swimming pool in the basement.&nbsp; Digging down only a few feet, they encountered lava rock that resisted their best efforts to excavate.&nbsp; The gym building, on which I looked out from my office in the old Spori, was finished a year later than planned, in 1918.&nbsp; It also cost twice as much as expected&mdash;$80,000, instead of the budgeted $40,000.&nbsp; The cost overrun stemmed both from construction difficulties and from wartime inflation of the prices of labor and raw materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar challenges were encountered in the construction of this BYU-Idaho Center:&nbsp; unforgiving lava rock and rising construction material prices increased the expected investment of time and money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, President Hinckley&rsquo;s suggestion to move quickly proved prophetic.&nbsp; Because his counsel was heeded, the funds for construction were committed before the 2008 drop in the world&rsquo;s financial markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prophetic inspiration behind these facilities has become apparent in other ways.&nbsp; In 2006, when these two buildings were approved, universities and colleges were enjoying what seemed to be a golden age.&nbsp; Strong student interest and financial markets produced record revenues in higher education.&nbsp; Many institutions expanded their faculties, curricular offerings, and campus facilities, as though student demand and public support for their services was assured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, many traditional universities and colleges face the need to retrench, and most have been forced to raise the prices they charge to students.&nbsp; One result is an increased need for the relatively low-cost, high-quality education that BYU-Idaho offers.&nbsp; As humble, faithful employees of this institution have heeded prophetic counsel and sought and received inspiration, they have discovered ways to serve more students at an affordable cost.&nbsp; Because of its unique design and consecrated employees, BYU-Idaho can grow to meet the needs of would-be students for whom a college education might otherwise be out of reach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure of what the Lord has planned for this university.&nbsp; Some future growth seems likely and the university seems to have been prepared to respond.&nbsp; These two facilities we dedicate today may be part of that preparation.&nbsp; I was with President Hinckley when he wrote the announcement that Ricks College would become BYU-Idaho, and I stood next to him as he read it publicly.&nbsp; I do not know whether he foresaw these two buildings.&nbsp; But I know that the Lord spoke through him, as the Lord also speaks through President Monson today.&nbsp; I also know that President Hinckley was as careful about the tithes of the Church and about his choice of words as anyone I have ever met.&nbsp; His description of these facilities as modest changes to the BYU-Idaho campus will, in time, seem perfectly apt.&nbsp; This institution, where frugality will continue to be a guiding spiritual and temporal principle, has been given by the Lord&rsquo;s prophets just what it needs to perform its divinely appointed role in His kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cannot see the future with precision but we can know what the Lord intends to accomplish and what it will take each of us to qualify personally to participate.&nbsp; He has laid plans for preparing the Church for His return. &nbsp;He reveals those plans a line at a time not only to prophets but to all of His worthy servants whose assignments require such revelation.&nbsp; These facilities, along with other buildings on this campus and the temple on the hill above it, have been constructed in accordance with His plans.&nbsp; The university is on a steady, upward course that will allow it to play a remarkable role in the Church and the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The institution&rsquo;s success in playing that role depends on the desires of its individual members.&nbsp; We must come to want what the Lord wants.&nbsp; We must come to want His approval more than that of the world.&nbsp; That is not easy in a world of agencies and people eager to certify, rank, and censure educational institutions.&nbsp; Making the changes the Lord wants will take uncommon courage and more than human wisdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because innovation means, by definition, doing things differently, receiving a steady stream of inspiration will require hearts that welcome change.&nbsp; Everything I have experienced and observed in this place gives me confidence that this institution will rise to the heights to which the Lord has designed it.&nbsp; I leave you with my blessing that your hearts will be filled with faith that the Lord goes before your face and that angels will be by your sides to bear you up as you go forward and upward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, please bow your heads and join me as I dedicate these two buildings, the BYU-Idaho Center and the expanded Manwaring Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prayer of dedication:</strong></p>
<p>O God, our Eternal Father, with thankful hearts we approach Thee in prayer on this day when we dedicate the BYU-Idaho Center and the expanded Manwaring Center.&nbsp; We are grateful for the prophetic vision that has guided the creation of these magnificent buildings.&nbsp; We are thankful for the faculty, administrators, and faithful servants in this university who have created the plans for these buildings.&nbsp; We also give Thee thanks for the architects, the contractors and subcontractors, and all who served in any capacity to construct these facilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We thank Thee for the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ, which makes this campus unique and valuable in the eyes of the students and the parents who trust their precious children to our care.&nbsp; We thank Thee for Thy Church and kingdom, established through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith.&nbsp; We thank Thee for the many facilities on this campus, including these structures, which will bless those who come to worship, to study, and to serve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acting in the authority of the holy priesthood in us vested, and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Creator of the Heaven and our Earth, we dedicate these buildings today.&nbsp; We dedicate the footings, the foundations, floors, ceilings, and roofs.&nbsp; We dedicate the walls, that they will remain strong and secure against any tremors or storms which may beat against them.&nbsp; We dedicate all the rooms and the appointments therein for Thy holy purposes, to teach and bless the wonderful young people who shall be privileged to learn the sacred truths of Life Eternal within these precincts.&nbsp; We bless those who will teach, learn, direct, perform, and serve in these buildings.&nbsp; May those who come here do so with gratitude and respect for the sacrifice which made these buildings and this university possible.&nbsp; May they also feel Thy welcome and Thine approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We invoke Thy blessing upon these structures and upon all who will enter them.&nbsp; We dedicate these buildings in the name of our Redeemer, whose life and Atonement have done for all of us what no other could do.&nbsp; At this season, we remember the gift of Thy Son and His resurrection, which gives us, and all His children, assurance that we may rise in the resurrection to live with Thee again.&nbsp; We express gratitude to Thee for the restored knowledge of our mortal and eternal possibilities to grow ever closer to Thee and more like Thee and Thy Son.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We thank Thee for all Thy bounteous blessings to this university and to this place.&nbsp; We thank Thee for the temple, which rises on the hill above these structures.&nbsp; We thank Thee for the influence of that holy house and pray that it may always be felt by those who come onto this campus and into these buildings dedicated to Thee and to Thy Son.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we recognize Thee as the Almighty God, the Father of all Thy sons and daughter who walk the earth in common brotherhood.&nbsp; We recognize Thee as the one who is above all, who is the greatest of all, and yet who loves us each one.&nbsp; We thank Thee, dear Father, for Thy wondrous blessings.&nbsp; Accept our gratitude and hear our petition we humbly pray as we dedicate these structures and dedicate ourselves to enlarging the tremendous opportunities which have come to us from Thee and which we are pledged to offer to others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do all this in the name of Thy Beloved Son and our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, it is a great day at BYU-Idaho. &nbsp;I am grateful for the opportunity to share a few remarks on this day of dedication.</p>
<p>My office window looks out on the two buildings that President Eyring will dedicate today&mdash;the BYU-Idaho Center and the new Manwaring Center.&nbsp; Every day for the last three and a half years I have watched the progress of construction and thought about and prayed about these buildings. &nbsp;I have walked through them many times.&nbsp; They are very familiar to me.&nbsp; And yet every time I walk into them, I feel a sense of wonder.&nbsp; You probably felt that sense of wonder as you came into the BYU-Idaho Center today, perhaps for the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first it is the building itself that seems so impressive. &nbsp;The sweep and scale of this structure are remarkable.&nbsp; But the wonder is not in the building, as impressive as it is. &nbsp;The wonder we feel is in the work that the Lord will do here. Speaking of the Restoration of the gospel, the Lord said:</p>
<p>"Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder." <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wonder we feel is in the Restoration, the spirit of gathering, and the powerful influence the Lord will have on the hundreds of thousands of young people who will gather here and whose lives will be changed forever by what they experience here.&nbsp; We sense the impact these wonderful young people will have in their homes, their communities, and the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our feelings of wonder, therefore, are tinged with gratitude and love.</p>
<p>* Gratitude for the Lord, for His tender mercies, and for His many blessings and miracles large and small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Gratitude for living prophets who have guided these projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Gratitude for those valiant pioneers whose faith, sacrifice, and hard work built this school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Gratitude for the widow&rsquo;s mite and the sacred offerings of so many Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Gratitude for the talents, skills, and devotion of the people who designed and built these buildings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Gratitude for the inspiring dedication and sacrifice of the good people who clean the buildings, set up the equipment,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shovel the snow, teach the classes, and do everything else that makes these buildings work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Gratitude for our privilege to serve the Lord in His marvelous work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* And finally, gratitude for the faith, humility, and goodness of the students of BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what we feel today on this day of dedication&mdash;wonder and gratitude as the Holy Spirit whispers to us of the love of our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;May it ever be so, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>At this long-awaited and very important rite of passage in your life, Sister Clark and I extend to you our congratulations and our love.</p>
<p>Today I want to leave you with two principles to help you on your journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principle #1: Keep the world out of your heart and the Spirit in it. </strong></p>
<p>Never, ever let the things of the world get into your heart. &nbsp;Never set your heart on things&mdash;on money, or houses, or cars, or snowmobiles, or 4-wheelers, or jewelry, or clothes, or anything else of the world. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let pleasure, or thrills, or career, or position, or power, or the honors of men get into your heart. &nbsp;They can get there very easily if you are not careful. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set your heart on the Lord and His kingdom, on your family and the things of eternity. &nbsp;Open your heart to the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, you will need all the gifts and powers of heaven and the healing, redeeming power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ that comes to you through the ministry of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;The Spirit is so important in your lives. &nbsp;Keep it with you. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t do anything, or wear anything, or say anything, or read anything, or listen to anything, or watch anything, or go anywhere that would drive the Spirit away. &nbsp;Keep the Spirit in your heart. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principle #2: Serve the Lord</strong></p>
<p>You will have many opportunities to serve the Lord. &nbsp;Here is my advice: &nbsp;always accept and always magnify callings in the Church. &nbsp;No matter what your bishop calls you to do, accept and magnify. &nbsp;When the call goes out to help with something in your ward, be the first one to stand up and say, &ldquo;Here am I, send me.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when the promptings of the Spirit come sending you on the Lord&rsquo;s errand of service, act on those promptings quickly, as soon as you can.&nbsp; This is your personal ministry. &nbsp;It comes from the Lord. &nbsp;The person who needs you may be right down the hall in your own home. &nbsp;It may be someone across the world. &nbsp;It may be a nephew or a neighbor. &nbsp;It may be a lost soul you do not know. &nbsp;Whoever it may be, when the impressions come, go!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is my counsel. &nbsp;It is the counsel you have heard so many times: be a good boy; be a good girl; and go&mdash;go where the Lord wants you to go, do what He wants you to do, be what He wants you to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I leave you with my love and my witness. &nbsp;I know that God lives. &nbsp;He is our Father in Heaven. &nbsp;His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer. &nbsp;He lives! &nbsp;This is His work, His church, and His kingdom restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith.&nbsp; Thomas S. Monson walks today where Joseph walked.&nbsp; He is the prophet of God. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have a marvelous destiny and a great work to do in the kingdom.&nbsp; I pray the Lord&rsquo;s choicest blessings on you and your families, this day and always. &nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a joy to be with you in this remarkable building on this important day in your lives.&nbsp; I have some understanding of your efforts to make it to this day and congratulate you on the accomplishment.&nbsp; I also have a deep regard for the efforts of others that have made this day possible for you; your parents and other family members, those who work at BYU Idaho, the Board of Trustees of this University, the many donors to the university, and the faithful tithe payers of the Church around the world. &nbsp;I offer my gratitude to you all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to read one phrase from the Doctrine and Covenants, give a little context to the phrase and then briefly explore its application to you at this point in your lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the phrase.&nbsp; &ldquo;&hellip;his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase&hellip;&rdquo; (D&amp;C 117:13).&nbsp; This phrase comes in some instructions regarding Oliver Granger.&nbsp; Oliver Granger is less familiar to us than some of his contemporaries like Brigham Young, Parley P. Pratt and Heber C. Kimball.&nbsp; The revelation and instructions came at a tumultuous time in Church history.&nbsp; Many saints were in the process of moving from Kirtland, Ohio to Northern Missouri because of persecution and apostasy in the Kirtland area.&nbsp; Oliver was an agent for the Church appointed to sell properties in Kirtland to help cover the debts of the Church and its leaders.&nbsp; He faithfully went about his duties and acquired a reputation in the local area for his integrity and goodness.&nbsp; He later moved to Illinois where the bulk of the saints were, and after a brief time there was called to return and preside over the church in Kirtland where he died and is buried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oliver did what he was called to do.&nbsp; He was willing to follow the Lord&rsquo;s counsel.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all the Lord asks of any of us.&nbsp; The blessings that come from that are never ending.&nbsp; The Lord also says in the same section, &ldquo;&hellip;let no man despise my servant Oliver Granger, but let the blessings of my people be on him forever and ever.&rdquo; (D&amp;C 117:15) And, &ldquo;I remember my servant Oliver Granger; behold, verily I say unto him that his name shall be had in sacred remembrance from generation to generation, forever and ever&hellip;&rdquo; (D&amp;C 117:12).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have done a lot of things together during your time here.&nbsp; You have attended devotionals and classes together.&nbsp; You have worshipped in your wards together and have participated in activities and study groups.&nbsp; You are now attending this commencement as a group.&nbsp; But from this point on your paths will diverge both geographically and in other aspects of your lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what your particular path will bring, but I do know that your sacrifice is more sacred than your increase.&nbsp; Whether that increase comes in the form of wealth, position or prominence, your sacrifice is more sacred than that increase.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this life whatever our increase is, we can use it to build up the kingdom.&nbsp; But, in the end, we will be judged on what we did, not on what we had.&nbsp; Whether your path is to prominence or relative obscurity, a life of modest means or of great wealth, your sacrifice is more sacred to the Lord than your increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you move forward in your life you will be invited many times to sacrifice.&nbsp; There will be thousands of opportunities to sacrifice for family and for the kingdom.&nbsp; Most of these will be small sacrifices of time and personal preference, but even some of those can be very difficult.&nbsp; As we learn to sacrifice in the normal course of our lives, the Lord is pleased and knows He can count on us to do whatever he asks of us.&nbsp; While most sacrifices won&rsquo;t get written up in the Ensign or the newspapers for all the world to see, the Lord is aware and we can sense His love for us.&nbsp; We will also find that we are blessed enormously for our willingness to follow the Lord&rsquo;s commandments and we will find ourselves becoming more like Him.&nbsp; We find real peace and true joy.&nbsp; Truly your sacrifice shall be more sacred than your increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time of year is a particularly wonderful time to remember the sacrifice of the Savior Jesus Christ, which is the most sacred of all sacrifices.&nbsp; I know that God lives and that His son, Jesus Christ, lives.&nbsp; I know they love us stand ready to bless and help us.&nbsp; I pray that the Lord will bless you as you move forward to a wonderful life.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Good morning, brothers and sisters!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a thrill it is for my wife, Kathy, and me to be with you graduates and your loved ones on this memorable day. You are an impressive sight. Based on my own experience with the aging process, I recommend you take lots of pictures today. As far as I can tell, it will be pretty much downhill from this point on!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rejoice with you in the accomplishment that your graduation from college represents. According to the United States Census Bureau, only 29 percent&mdash;slightly more than one quarter&mdash;of the U.S. population over age twenty-five has a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher. Whether you are receiving an associate&rsquo;s or a bachelor&rsquo;s degree today, you have indeed achieved something significant and become part of a select group. On behalf of all of us who have come to celebrate with you graduates today, I express admiration and commendation to you for your hard work, your perseverance, and your desire to prepare well for the future. I know that what you have learned here will bless you and your families throughout this life and will, as promised, rise with you in the resurrection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know, too, that my commencement address is essentially all that remains between you and total happiness today! A German saying from my mission comes to mind: &ldquo;In der K&uuml;rze liegt die W&uuml;rze.&rdquo; Roughly translated this means, &ldquo;In brevity there is power.&rdquo; I think on a day such as this, in brevity there is also wisdom. Accordingly, I have but two simple points to make. I will make the first with a &ldquo;brief&rdquo; story.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty years ago Kathy and I led the New York Rochester Mission for two years. One day a local leader of a large and prominent church called me. He explained that he was the chairman of a committee that had the assignment to revitalize the attendance and activity of the young adult members of his church in the greater Rochester area. He had scouted around and found that of all churches in that area, the LDS Church had the most active and engaged group of young adults. He inquired if I would be willing to share with him and his committee the secrets of our Church&rsquo;s success? As you can imagine, this was a wonderful invitation for an eager mission president to receive! I thanked him for asking, but told him I wanted a day or two to think about how I could be most helpful before accepting his offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days later&mdash;after considerable reflection&mdash;I called him back. I told him that there was a way I might help him and his church produce faithful and believing young adults, but there was a hitch: my solution would require them to adopt Mormonism&mdash;in its entirety! He thanked me politely, but declined. I was disappointed, but not surprised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What led me to respond to him as I did? It was the realization that the production of religiously interested and spiritually strong young adults&mdash;and there are about 1300 of you present and graduating today&mdash;isn&rsquo;t simply the result of an identifiable Church program or activity or curriculum; rather, it represents the fruits of the incomparable way of life to be had by living the restored gospel of Jesus Christ&mdash;in its entirety!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it. Even before a baby is born we know of its spiritual existence, and we typically await its arrival on earth with great anticipation. Clothing and supplies are purchased, baby showers are held, prayers are offered, and no effort is spared in preparing for such a blessed moment. In this country, where approximately 40 percent of all babies are now born out of wedlock, consider the blessing of being born to parents who are married&mdash;eternally&mdash;and who at their baby&rsquo;s birth immediately adore him or her and begin to offer security, love, and a gospel-centered way of life. That is truly coming to earth with a &ldquo;head start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But life has only just begun. In the Latter-day Saint home, the newborn makes its public debut within a few weeks, when he or she is brought before the ward family to be given a name and a blessing. Ever after, that baby has an immediate extended family of three or four hundred people who know the child by name and are interested in its welfare. As a young boy growing up in such a ward, word of my misdeeds always arrived home before I did! By eighteen months the acculturation and teaching of the child begins in the Primary nursery. At age three he or she is promoted to the wonderful status of a &ldquo;Sunbeam&rdquo;! Through gospel instruction&mdash;including the learning of never-to-be-forgotten songs, such as &ldquo;Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam,&rdquo; &ldquo;I Am a Child of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Follow the Prophet,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Book of Mormon Stories&rdquo;&mdash;the child begins preparation for baptism at eight years of age. This early opportunity for an LDS child to participate in a sacred ordinance and to make covenants with God is an event that never leaves his or her consciousness. Who among us can&rsquo;t vividly recall the details of our own baptism and our promise to follow Christ and keep His commandments?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider, too, how helpful it is to renew those promises every Sunday of our lives by partaking of the sacrament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary ends at age twelve, when young men are ordained deacons in the Aaronic Priesthood and join the Young Men&rsquo;s program, while girls join the Young Women&rsquo;s auxiliary. At that point, in addition to Sunday church meetings, young people meet one night a week for &ldquo;Mutual,&rdquo; the youth program. They also begin to participate in Duty to God and Personal Progress programs that provide wide-ranging opportunities for personal development. A few years later, as they enter ninth grade, they begin attending an hour-long class five days a week known as &ldquo;seminary.&rdquo; During the four years this goes on, Latter-day Saint youth work their way through a course of study involving the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Book of Mormon, and Church history. Many even get up long before the sun does to be able to attend such a class. During these years youth also participate in a variety of service projects, summer camps, youth conferences, and, if they desire, they can obtain what President Thomas S. Monson has called a &ldquo;Personal Liahona&rdquo; by receiving a patriarchal blessing. These growing up years aren&rsquo;t just times of passive Church attendance. Most young people serve as leaders in their quorums and classes. As part of this service, they sit in councils with their bishopric and youth leaders, where plans and decisions are made, and they have opportunity to minister and serve in tangible ways. It is a wonderful time of learning, service, and growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the institutional path for LDS youth I have described is really secondary in importance to what goes on at home during those formative years. In the best of cases, there is a wonderful religious rhythm to Latter-day Saint domestic life. Days are begun and ended with family prayers, dinner-time gatherings and conversations are regular and lively, the Holy Scriptures are individually owned&mdash;this alone is remarkable&mdash;and are also often regularly read in the family circle. Even if a family specializes only in the First Book of Nephi, as was the case with our family&rsquo;s Book of Mormon reading program, there is great benefit to be had from the consistent striving. Monday night&rsquo;s family home evening&mdash;reserved for a song, a lesson, a game, and a treat&mdash;is a unique feature of Latter-day Saint home life. Although on any given Monday night anxious parents may wonder whether they&rsquo;ve done more harm than good, the cumulative positive effect of such evenings over the period of a child&rsquo;s life at home is incalculable. Where the family head is a father, there is also the influence at home of priesthood and its power. Sometimes a caring home teacher or uncle or bishop can be a substitute for a missing father. Priesthood blessings are given when a family member is ill, upon a child returning to school, on the eve of a child&rsquo;s marriage, and on other special occasions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also the doctrinal dimension of home life to consider. Parents have been commanded to teach their children the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ, and baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost&mdash;and most do. Most also understand that they can have power and influence with their children only when they honor agency and lead their family with gentleness, meekness, and love unfeigned. In this connection, I vividly remember Kathy and I beginning an interview with one of our daughters&mdash;in a day when we thought those individual monthly sessions with each child were doing such good&mdash;with the daughter exclaiming, &ldquo;Okay, mom and dad, hammer away!&rdquo; Sooner or later most parents are guided by the Spirit to know that it is a combination of example, love, agency, teaching, and Spirit that helps a child internalize gospel principles and want to live his or her life accordingly. This intergenerational transfer of faith and of the LDS way of life&mdash;without compulsory means&mdash;is the quest of all right-thinking Latter-day Saint parents and is the source of some of life&rsquo;s greatest joys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all goes as hoped and planned, at eighteen the young men and women of the Church usually have some combination of three worthy goals in mind: a mission, an education, and eventually eternal marriage. &ldquo;Turning in one&rsquo;s papers&rdquo;&mdash;which in this digital age is no longer an accurate description of the missionary application process&mdash;is one of the most anxiously anticipated events of a young man&rsquo;s and, increasingly, of a young woman&rsquo;s life. It is also attended by a spiritual milestone of great significance: participation in the temple endowment ceremony and, for young men, being ordained an elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood. Here again, as with baptism, in the temple a young Latter-day Saint experiences a sacred and highly educational ordinance, coupled with meaningful covenants designed to produce a life of integrity and consecration to the Lord&rsquo;s purposes. It will soon be fifty years since the experience of my own first endowment in the Logan Temple. I can recall the details and my feelings with great clarity. When it is entered into with real intent, the endowment ceremony can become life changing and acts to instill in the participant a lasting loyalty to the Savior and His kingdom. The missionary service that follows is one of the miracles of this world. A constant force of approximately 50,000 young adults deployed across the world in full-time service, supported primarily by self and family, is something simply incomprehensible to most non-LDS observers. With 25,000 of these young adult missionaries returning home each year&mdash;each one having become more knowledgeable about life, committed to the gospel, and focused on a constructive future&mdash;it&rsquo;s no wonder, as I discovered in Rochester, that the Church&rsquo;s single adult activity rate is something to be envied! Following a mission, an education, and the crowning ordinance of eternal marriage become the next steps. You graduates know much about both of these&mdash;or you soon will! I must also observe that the educational opportunity you have had here at BYU-Idaho&mdash;in terms of both curriculum and faculty&mdash;is exceptional!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point you&rsquo;re probably wondering why I have surveyed in such detail the path most of you have walked in reaching the educational summit on which you stand today. It&rsquo;s to make my first point: Please&mdash;this day and always&mdash;recognize and remember and be grateful that you are the beneficiaries of and have grown up under the greatest religious, cultural, and social system on earth, the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. And, you have been blessed to experience it in its entirety! In short, you have been reared according to God&rsquo;s plan. In that process, the investment of love, teaching, and tangible resources the Church and your families have made in you to this point in your lives is phenomenal. We often hear about how good you are&mdash;that you are a chosen generation&mdash;and I sincerely believe that is true. But I must honestly add: you ought to be! You ought to be! No effort, no expense, no opportunity has been spared to enable you to achieve your God-given potential. To borrow a line from <em>The Sound of Music,</em> &ldquo;nothing comes from nothing, nothing ever could . . . !&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That leads me to my second and final point: Therefore, what? Therefore, what? That profound question, by the way, was once posed as the sole comment President Boyd K. Packer reportedly made in reviewing a general conference talk one of the other Apostles had prepared! President Packer&rsquo;s intent, I believe, was to help his fellow Apostle realize that to be complete, the talk he had written needed to suggest some application of the principles it contained, some action that ought to follow, some improvement that should occur. Is that not a fair expectation to have of you graduates today as well? Given the life&rsquo;s experiences most of you have had thus far growing up in and being so richly blessed by the restored gospel of Jesus Christ&mdash;and I want to give you due credit for your personal efforts and wise use of agency&mdash;what now is your future obligation? Therefore, what?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a suggestion: My hope is that you will consider your blessed beginning in life as a prelude to a deep and lasting commitment to become a true disciple of Jesus Christ. His invitation, &ldquo;Come, follow me&rdquo; (Luke 18:22), speaks to the soul of every man or woman who acknowledges His divinity and has experienced the miracle of His forgiveness. Consciously choosing to live a life of discipleship will enable you in time to translate all the experiences, teachings, ordinances, and covenants of your youth into improved personal behavior&mdash;into becoming more Christlike. You have already learned many things in your young lives, but knowledge alone cannot save. It&rsquo;s difficult to improve on the sobering words of King Benjamin, who said, &ldquo;Now, if ye believe all these things see that ye do them&rdquo; (Mosiah 4:10).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Living the life of a disciple will help you &ldquo;put off&rdquo; the natural man or woman, and then you will find yourselves becoming more saintly (Mosiah 3:19). I see evidence of this wherever I go in the Church. In every land there are good men and women, not particularly concerned with social or economic status, who are becoming saintly. It is my fondest hope that this will be your future as well. Please don&rsquo;t simply be inheritors of the spiritual riches I have described, but rather be active disciples of the Lord. Serve and love and learn and teach and share and bless others&mdash;and practice the self-denial of a disciple that will allow you to master appetites and passions. And above all, do all of this at home. We make our covenants in churches and temples, but they are best kept at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A life of discipleship&mdash;of consistently seeking to live as Christ did and to become like Him&mdash;is, I believe, the way we best come to know Him; and coming to know Him and His Father, our Father, is &ldquo;life eternal&rdquo; (John 17:3). For many years I have had inscribed at the front of my triple combination this priceless quote from the prophet of my youth, President David O. McKay: &ldquo;That man [and I&rsquo;ll add &ldquo;that woman&rdquo;] is most truly great who is most Christlike. What you sincerely in your heart think of Christ will determine what you are, will largely determine what your acts will be&rdquo; (Conference Report, April 1951, p. 93).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, think enough of Christ to make Him your master and to strive all your life to be His disciple. On this most memorable and pivotal day in your young lives, I wish you good health, good happiness, good fortune, and lives as committed disciples of the Savior. I know that &ldquo;No man cometh unto the Father, but by [Him]&rdquo; (John 14:6). Maybe all we really need to know we did learn in Primary: Let&rsquo;s be sunbeams for Him! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
