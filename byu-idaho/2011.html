<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Kim B. Clark became the 15th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in August 2005. &nbsp;From April 2007 through April 2014, he served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br /><br />President Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and raised in Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;After serving as a missionary for the Church in Germany, he married his wife, Sue, in 1971. &nbsp;President Clark earned bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in economics from Harvard University.<br /><br />In 1978 Kim Clark became a member of the faculty at the Harvard Business School, and in 1995 he became dean of the school. &nbsp;He served in that capacity until his departure to become the president of BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 22 grandchildren.</p>
<p>I am grateful to be with you on this historic day-another great day at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us today.<br /><br />Sister Clark spoke about the courageous pioneers who settled this valley and built this school.&nbsp; At the very heart of their courage and devotion was faith in Jesus Christ, in His Church, and in His living prophet.&nbsp; That faith had been tried and tested on the plains of Nebraska and Wyoming and in the mountain valleys of Utah.&nbsp; There was strength in that faith, spiritual strength that fortified and blessed those men and women.&nbsp;<br /><br />You and I do not have to survive brutal winters in a mud-roofed dugout or dig canals in the freezing rain and driving wind.&nbsp; We do not have to travel 200 miles on horseback to find a doctor or try to feed a family when all the crops have been destroyed by a late frost.&nbsp; That is not our call.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our call is different; but we, too, need great faith in the Savior because storms rage in our day as well.&nbsp; Elder Henry B. Eyring talked about those storms and the faith we need to endure them well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What we will need in our day of testing . . . is to have developed faith in Jesus Christ so powerful that we can pass the test of life upon which everything for us in eternity depends. . . . We will need to have . . . nurtured faith in Jesus Christ long before Satan hits us, as he will, with doubts and appeals to our carnal desires and with lying voices saying that good is bad and that there is no sin.&nbsp; Those spiritual storms are already raging. . . . [T]he great test of life is to see whether we will hearken to and obey God's commands in the midst of the storms of life.&nbsp;<sup>[1]</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>You and I are embarked on a great journey in a world no less challenging and perhaps even more spiritually dangerous than the one the pioneers faced.&nbsp; Sister Clark and I love you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know of your goodness and your faith.&nbsp; We know of the challenges you face now, and we know something of the storms and tests you will face in the years ahead.&nbsp; We know that Heavenly Father has prepared for you marvelous gifts and blessings that will increase your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the parable of the grain of mustard seed, the Savior taught His apostles about the kind of faith we need.&nbsp; Please turn with me to Matthew, chapter 13, verses 31 and 32:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the&nbsp;<a href="http://new.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/13?lang=eng" target="_self">birds</a>&nbsp;of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.&nbsp;<sup>[2]</sup></p>
<p>Please keep this image in your minds and turn now to Matthew, chapter 17, verses 19 and&nbsp;20. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.&nbsp;<sup>[3]&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Remember what we have learned about the mustard seed:&nbsp; It isn't just tiny; it is incredibly dynamic.&nbsp; It can grow into a tree so large and inviting that birds come to lodge there.&nbsp; The Savior's message is clear:&nbsp; If your faith in Jesus Christ is active and vibrant, if it grows and develops in you like the mustard seed grows and develops into a tree, "nothing shall be impossible unto you."&nbsp;<sup>[4]</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to focus today on what you and I can do to have faith like a grain of mustard seed-active, dynamic faith in Jesus Christ that brings heavenly power into our lives.&nbsp; I will speak about three fundamental principles:&nbsp; 1) faith in Jesus Christ is a gift of the Spirit; 2) faith in Christ is a principle of action; and 3) faith in Christ is a principle of power.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Faith in Jesus Christ is a Gift of the Spirit</strong><br />Paul taught:&nbsp; ". . . faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."&nbsp;<sup>[5]</sup>&nbsp; Faith in Jesus Christ is the spiritual assurance and evidence that inspires confidence and trust in Him, in His power, and in what He says and promises.&nbsp; Our faith is in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; We trust in His will, His timing, and His way.&nbsp;<br /><br />Increased faith in Jesus Christ is a gift of the Spirit "come from God, for the benefit of the children of God."&nbsp;<sup>[6]</sup>&nbsp; It comes by hearing the chosen servants of the Lord bear witness of Christ through the power of the Holy Ghost.<sup>&nbsp;[7]</sup>&nbsp; This is what the scriptures call "the words of Christ."&nbsp;<sup>[8]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />When the Lord's servants bear witness of Christ, "the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men."&nbsp;<sup>[9]</sup>&nbsp; As Alma taught us, if our hearts are open to the Spirit, the words of Christ stir our souls.&nbsp; We receive what the Lord called "the words of eternal life . . . the record of heaven; the Comforter; the peaceable things of immortal glory. . . ."<sup>&nbsp;[10]</sup>&nbsp; The words of Christ lift our sense of what is possible and strengthen our faith in Him because we feel "the record of heaven."&nbsp;<sup>[11]</sup>&nbsp;President Joseph F. Smith said of this marvelous gift:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[I]n coming here, we forgot all. . . .&nbsp; But by the power of the Spirit, in the redemption of Christ, through obedience, we often catch a spark from the awakened memories of the immortal soul, which lights up our whole being as with the glory of our former home.<sup>&nbsp;[12]</sup></p>
<p>I felt that "record of heaven"&nbsp;<sup>[13]</sup>&nbsp;the first time I saw and heard a prophet speak.&nbsp; I was 11 years old.&nbsp; President David O. McKay had come to dedicate our new ward chapel.&nbsp; I remember the feeling I had when I heard he was coming.&nbsp; I felt such a strong desire to be there that I went very early and got a seat on the front row.&nbsp; I saw President McKay and heard him bear witness of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; I knew he was a prophet of God.&nbsp; I was lifted and strengthened in my faith in Christ that day by God's living prophet.&nbsp; It was a wonderful gift from my Heavenly Father.&nbsp;<br /><br />We all need to hear the word of Christ from people whose lives are living testimonies of the Savior and who speak by the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; That is why we encourage you and invite you to come to devotional each week and to participate actively in your wards and stakes.&nbsp; That is why the Brethren put so much emphasis on daily scripture study and prayer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hearing the words of Christ raises our spiritual sights and helps our faith grow.&nbsp; But if we are hearers of the word only, our faith will wither and die.&nbsp;<sup>[14]</sup>&nbsp; The gift of faith in Christ will be like the grain of mustard seed only if we receive the gift and act in faith in Him.&nbsp; That brings us to the second principle:&nbsp; Faith in Christ is a principle of action.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Faith in Christ is a Principle of Action</strong></p>
<p>When we act in faith in Christ, we take action to keep our covenants in the face of opposition, even before we know how things are going to work out.&nbsp; The Lord has blessed us with agency to act for ourselves, but there is opposition in all things.&nbsp; Opposition may come from temptations of the adversary or from our own fears or weaknesses.&nbsp; It may come from the actions of others or the natural elements.&nbsp;<br /><br />That opposition means that when we act in faith in Christ, our faith is tried and tested.&nbsp; Think about Nephi going into Jerusalem to get the brass plates.&nbsp; He had an assignment from the Lord, and he had opposition.&nbsp; He and his brothers had already tried twice to get the plates and failed. &nbsp;But Nephi would not give up.&nbsp; He acted in faith in Christ, and he went back:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.&nbsp;And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.<sup>&nbsp;[15]</sup></p>
<p>As Nephi went toward Laban's house, the Spirit guided him.&nbsp; But he was at the limit of his understanding of what to do.&nbsp; He was at the personal frontier of his assignment.&nbsp; In order to keep his covenants, Nephi had to go beyond the frontier with faith in Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to share with you a story about two missionaries tracting on a hillside above Baden, Switzerland, who learned the power of this principle.&nbsp; One of the missionaries had trouble with his right contact lens.&nbsp; He took it out; but the wind caught it, and it was lost.&nbsp; They searched to no avail and then decided to pray.&nbsp; Here is what happened in Elder Richard Cracroft's own words:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As I concluded the prayer and stood up, I received one of those Joseph Smith "flashes of intelligence."&nbsp; . . . Explaining the plan to my startled companion, I stood . . . in the same place I had stood earlier [and] squeezed out my left contact lens.&nbsp;Assured that my companion was on his knees and at the ready, I put my left lens . . . on my finger some six inches from my face. . . .&nbsp; A slight breeze caught my left lens, and it was gone. . . .&nbsp; I stood stock-still, heart in throat, until Elder Reading said, "I see it.&nbsp; It's still in the air."&nbsp;"Don't lose it," I pled.&nbsp;"It's still up," he whispered. . . .&nbsp; Then, from . . . further away, he exclaimed, "It's starting to fall!"&nbsp;"Keep your eye on it," I pled again.&nbsp;"I see it!&nbsp; I see it!" he said.&nbsp; There was a long pause and then, "Oh . . . ! Oh&nbsp;. . . !"&nbsp;I braced.&nbsp;He said, . . . "it's landed almost right on top of the other lens!"&nbsp;"You see the other lens?"&nbsp; I shouted.&nbsp;"Yes, it's right here!"&nbsp;Unable to see a thing, I crawled over to him.&nbsp; Slowly, he planted in my palm, in order, my left and right lenses. . . .&nbsp; I wet the lenses and . . . implanted them . . . .&nbsp; [W]e knelt, and full of gratitude I thanked . . . God for tender mercies.&nbsp;<sup>[16]</sup></p>
<p>Elder Cracroft and Elder Reading acted in faith and experienced something President Eyring has taught, "Increased spiritual strength is a gift from God which He can give when we push in His service to our limits."<sup>&nbsp;[17]</sup>&nbsp; That is where we find our personal frontier.&nbsp; There is a personal frontier for each one of us in every covenant, commandment, calling, and assignment we receive from the Lord.&nbsp; The frontier is defined by the light we have already received and by our knowledge, understanding, skill, and experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are many examples all around us.&nbsp; As I share these examples with you, please consider this question:&nbsp; Where is the frontier in my life?&nbsp; As you reflect on that question, the Holy Ghost will inspire you and guide you.&nbsp; Here are some examples of the frontier:&nbsp;</p>
<p>These situations and the hundreds of others we could describe are the frontier.&nbsp; You may have felt promptings today about your own frontier.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the frontier we can't see how it is going to work.&nbsp; We can't see how to do what lies before us.&nbsp; We don't know what to do.&nbsp; We don't feel we have the ability to do it.&nbsp; That is the frontier.&nbsp;<br /><br />The frontier is where the Savior works.&nbsp; It is where we keep our covenants by acting in faith in Christ.&nbsp; We face opposition and hard decisions, and we act in faith in Christ trusting that the Lord will open the way.&nbsp; We pray for help, and then we go to work-we study hard; we seek out the angels in the tutoring center; we talk to our roommates; we go to the bishop; we dress modestly; we work to forgive; we raise our hand in class; we take the internship and a thousand other things with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we do these things, we establish a pattern of faith for life.&nbsp; We keep our covenants no matter what the opposition is.&nbsp; We push beyond whatever frontier we face trusting in the Savior; and He blesses us with increased faith, preparing us for new frontiers in His service.&nbsp; Elder D. Todd Christofferson has taught us how this happens:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[A]s we honor our covenants, . . . faith expands.&nbsp; In the first place, the promised fruits of obedience become evident, which confirms our faith.&nbsp; Secondly, the Spirit communicates God's pleasure, and we feel secure in His continued blessing and help. . . .<sup>&nbsp;[18]</sup></p>
<p>Increased faith comes as a gift from the Lord.&nbsp; It is like the mustard seed and sunlight.&nbsp; The seed works and works to put out that little sprout, and then comes the life-giving light.&nbsp; When we hear the words of Christ and act in faith, we invite the Lord to work in our lives.&nbsp; As He taught the Prophet Joseph Smith, "I work not among the children of men save it be according to their faith."&nbsp;<sup>[19]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />When our faith in Christ is like a grain of mustard seed-active and vibrant-He will work miracles in our lives, increasing our faith and blessing us with His almighty power.&nbsp; This brings us to the third principle:&nbsp; Faith in Jesus Christ is a principle of power.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Faith in Christ is a Principle of Power</strong><br />The power that comes into our lives through faith in Jesus Christ is the power of God.&nbsp; Through His submission to the will of His Father, through His atoning sacrifice and glorious resurrection, Jesus descended below all things, overcame all things, and received all power over all things.&nbsp; He is the light and life of the world.&nbsp; Jesus Himself bore witness of His power to His Apostles just before He ascended into Heaven:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.&nbsp;<sup>[20]</sup></p>
<p>Jesus invites each of us personally and individually to come to Him, to exercise faith in Him that He might bless us with that power.&nbsp; In His atoning sacrifice Jesus walked the path He bids us to walk.&nbsp; He carried the crushing weight of our sins, our sorrows, our challenges, our problems, our mistakes, and our pain.&nbsp; He faced every frontier we face, and He overcame them all.&nbsp; He knows that He can save us from the awful darkness of sin, addiction, and error.&nbsp; He knows that His grace is sufficient to strengthen us in the face of any challenge.&nbsp; He bids us to come and promises us His blessing.&nbsp; Please turn with me to 3 Nephi, chapter 9, verse 14, and listen to the certainty in His voice:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall have eternal life.&nbsp; Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me.&nbsp;<sup>[21]</sup></p>
<p>And so the Lord Jesus Christ stands at the frontier-at every personal frontier-with His arm of mercy stretched out inviting us to come unto Him, exercise faith in Him, and be blessed through His power.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>A Story of Faith</strong><br />I would like to close today with a story about a young man who came to BYU-Idaho, accepted the Lord's invitation, and learned the power of faith in Christ.&nbsp; I talked with him just a few days ago.&nbsp; Here is his story, in his own voice.&nbsp; As you listen, please notice how the gift of increased faith blessed his life.<br /><br />&nbsp;Let me give you some background to my story. &nbsp;I was kind of an average student in high school, probably an underachiever.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I didn't realize early on that things like trigonometry were related to anything important later in life.&nbsp; I did okay in school, but was not really plugged in academically.&nbsp; I was on the seminary council, and I tried to do things the right way.&nbsp; I didn't think about going to school at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp;<br /><br />I had made some plans for college, but was still really unsettled about it. One day I drove up the canyon to think.&nbsp; As I sat there, I had this strong feeling come to me:&nbsp; "Go home."&nbsp; So, I went home and pulled out my patriarchal blessing. &nbsp;As I read, there was a line in the blessing that seemed like it was highlighted in yellow.&nbsp; It just jumped off the page.&nbsp; The line told me that the Lord would help me to organize my life at the right time to accomplish my eternal purposes.&nbsp; In that moment BYU-Idaho came into my mind.&nbsp;<br /><br />I went downstairs and told my parents that I was thinking about going to BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; They were happy.&nbsp; I applied and got in, and I went to Rexburg.&nbsp;<br /><br />That is where my life began.&nbsp; I have been to some very good schools since then, but I have never had an educational experience like the one I had at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; I decided to study physics, which scared my parents and worried me, but it felt like the right thing to do.&nbsp;<br /><br />I took a math class I needed for my major, but realized right away I was in over my head.&nbsp; I went to the tutoring center and one of the students there figured out that she would need to teach me mathematics from the very beginning.&nbsp;<br /><br />I burned a tremendous amount of midnight oil.&nbsp; It was a total awakening. And it was very hard.&nbsp; I remember one night, especially.&nbsp; I was struggling mightily in that math class.&nbsp; I was in trouble and really behind.&nbsp; I didn't think I could do it anymore, had actually filled out a card to drop the class, and was about to hand it in.&nbsp; I called my dad and talked to him.&nbsp; He encouraged me and gave me some good advice about getting more help.&nbsp; That night I decided not to give up.&nbsp; I decided to have faith that somehow the tide would turn.&nbsp;<br /><br />And it did.&nbsp; My classmates helped me, my teacher helped me, my tutor helped me, and the Lord was there.&nbsp; I can see now that I was surrounded by people who wanted me to succeed.&nbsp; These people cared about me, and I felt the Spirit of the Lord help me to learn.&nbsp;<br /><br />That experience completely turned my life around academically.&nbsp; I passed that class and did well in school.&nbsp; That experience gave me an idea of who I was and of my potential as a child of God.&nbsp; It prepared me to serve a mission.&nbsp; I will be forever grateful for that experience.&nbsp;<sup>[22]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Today, this young man and his wife have a beautiful family.&nbsp; He has a productive professional career and has served the Lord in many capacities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />He still has that drop card he decided not to turn in.&nbsp; He has kept it because it helps him remember that with the gift of faith and the Lord's blessing of power he can do hard things.&nbsp; He still faces frontiers in his life, and he still acts in faith in Christ trusting in His almighty power.&nbsp; He has faith as a grain of mustard seed.&nbsp; That is a pattern he established at BYU-Idaho, where people who know taught him the truth of this promise of the Lord to all the children of God:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.&nbsp;<sup>[23]</sup></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Testimony</strong><br />I conclude today with an invitation, my witness, a blessing, and a promise.&nbsp; In the October 2010 General Conference President&nbsp;<br /><br />Thomas S. Monson said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Who was this "man of sorrows, . . . acquainted with grief"?&nbsp; "Who is this King of glory,"<sup>&nbsp;</sup>this Lord of lords?&nbsp; He is our Master.&nbsp; He is our Savior.&nbsp; He is the Son of God.&nbsp; He is the Author of Our Salvation.&nbsp; He beckons, "Follow me."&nbsp; He instructs, "Go, and do thou likewise."<sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>He pleads, "Keep my commandments."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Let us follow Him.&nbsp; Let us emulate His example.&nbsp; Let us obey His words.&nbsp;<sup>[24]</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is our call, brothers and sisters.&nbsp; It is a call we can fulfill only with faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I bear witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior, and Redeemer.&nbsp; He leads His Church and kingdom on the earth through His living prophet, President Thomas S. Monson. Faith in Christ like a grain of mustard seed is a gift from a loving Heavenly Father through His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; It comes from hearing the word of Christ, acting in faith in Christ, and trusting in His almighty power.&nbsp; I so testify.&nbsp;<br /><br />I invoke the Lord's blessings upon you, that the word of Christ will stir your souls; that you will feel the record of heaven and be lifted and strengthened in your faith in Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />I promise you that if you will act in faith in Christ to push beyond whatever frontiers you may face, He will bless you with His power, your faith in Christ will be like a grain of mustard seed, and "nothing shall be impossible unto you."&nbsp;<sup>[25]</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I leave you with this promise and blessing, my witness and my love in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>I am honored to be with you this afternoon.&nbsp; I love the young adults of the Church.&nbsp; I don't know of any group in the Church that has more vitality, more enthusiasm, more potential and more opportunities for service than you do.&nbsp; Thank you for who you are, for all you do, and for how you make us feel when we are in your presence.<br /><br />When Sister Dahlquist and I were growing up in the Boise 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Ward, as teenagers we had a Mutual theme - much the same as we do today.&nbsp; One year, the theme was from Alma 34, verse 32:&nbsp; "For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors."&nbsp; I would like to use that scripture as my text - my theme this afternoon.&nbsp; Years after I memorized the scripture, I heard the message expressed in these words:&nbsp; "Five minutes before the dance is no time to learn the Samba."&nbsp;<br /><br />I know how busy most of you are, with studies and work and Church service and families.&nbsp; And I hope that for a few minutes this afternoon, we can pause amidst the "things" and "events" of life, to see this as a marvelous time of preparation for all that will happen for the rest of your life - for it has been my experience that what is important to you now, will also determine your values throughout the remainder of your life.&nbsp; And so, in that vein, I mention six suggestions to help you make the most of this time of preparation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Number 1: Remember who you are.&nbsp; In Primary, most of us learned the children's hymn, "I am a Child of God."&nbsp; I know of no better reminder of who we are, than the words of this little hymn:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am a child of GodAnd He has sent me here,Has given me an earthly home,With parents kind and dear.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>If we will remember who we are and whose name we bear, it will have a profound impact on our lives, our decisions and the opportunities we have.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am a father and a grandfather, and just as I love and am mindful of each of our five daughters and our 12 grandchildren, so our Heavenly Father is aware of each one of us.&nbsp; He has said, "For behold, this is my work and my glory - to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;There may be times when we forget, and feel discouraged and alone.&nbsp; If you get into one of those "down times" and wonder if there is anyone listening to your pleas, may I bear witness that God does live, that we are his children, that he hears and answers our prayers and that we are not alone.&nbsp;<br /><br />One Sunday when I was a stake president I was at home - a fairly rare occurrence.&nbsp; That day our oldest daughter had a meltdown, told us we were the worst parents in the world, went downstairs to her room, slammed the door and turned her music up to at least 2,000 decibels.&nbsp; After several minutes of the entire house rattling, I went downstairs to tell her to turn her music down.&nbsp; As I approached her room, I heard the words of her music: "You're not alone."&nbsp; I stopped and thought, "If there is any message that should be blasted into the very soul of every Latter-day Saint - young or old - it is that one!"&nbsp; So I turned around and went back upstairs - without even mentioning to her that I had been there.&nbsp; In a few minutes, the music came down on its own. She came up and said, "I'm sorry."&nbsp; We said the same, and the Spirit returned to our home.&nbsp; It has been many years since that Sunday, but I have never forgotten the message:&nbsp; We are children of a kind Heavenly Father and are, indeed, not alone.&nbsp;<br /><br />The scriptures are filled with reassurances of our divine being and the fact that we are not alone.&nbsp; One of those in Hebrews reads: &nbsp;"What is man, that thou art mindful of him?...Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands..."&nbsp;<sup>3</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>I am a Child of God,His Promises are sure,Celestial Glory Shall be mine,If I can but endure.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>He lives, we are His Children and we are not alone.&nbsp;<br /><br />My second suggestion: take seriously your academic preparation.&nbsp; Now is, indeed, the time to prepare.&nbsp; When I was trying to decide on a career, my father said, "I don't care what you do - only that you do it well!"&nbsp; In the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 88, the Lord reveals to the Prophet Joseph these familiar words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;"<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>That is the command or the "what" from the Lord.&nbsp; But the "why" of what He is commanding us, finally comes in verse 80:&nbsp; "That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you."&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; We are, indeed, a peculiar people, with a peculiarly wonderful and divine mission.&nbsp; Those things you learn here, whether of a spiritual or a temporal nature, will prepare you to better serve your family and the kingdom - wherever in the world the Lord sends you.&nbsp; Tom Brokaw was once quoted as saying:&nbsp; "In this country it's easy to make a living, but it's tough to make a difference."&nbsp; Your experiences here at BYU-Idaho will help you not only make a living, but make a difference as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition to the substance of your major studies, learn to read critically, to write clearly, and to speak persuasively.&nbsp; Take a foreign language. If I can, at my young age, be learning Russian and Swedish, you can learn a foreign language, too.&nbsp; Take seriously not only the studies of your major, but also your general education classes.&nbsp; A friend of mine who worked in administration at a large university said, "That which you learn in your major helps give you a living; that which you learn in your general education classes helps give you a life."&nbsp; That has been my experience as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />Third, don't put the things of eternity on the shelf while you are here at school, including serving in the kingdom and growing spiritually.&nbsp; This is not only a time for academic growth, but spiritual growth and setting spiritual patterns as well.&nbsp; And if ever there was a time when you need the Spirit of the Lord in your lives, it is now!&nbsp; I offer three suggestions when I talk about the "things of eternity."&nbsp; First, continue your own personal spiritual growth through daily prayer, scripture study, and attending the temple.&nbsp; Second, respond to opportunities to serve in the Church.&nbsp; You might not have the time to serve that you will have at later stages in your life, but look for opportunities to serve in formal callings and otherwise.&nbsp; I once had a bishop who knew he should do genealogy and family history work, but just didn't have a lot of time, with employment, family, and being a bishop of a very large ward.&nbsp; But he decided that every Fast Sunday, he would go to the Family History Library and work as hard as he could for an hour each month.&nbsp; At the end of that hour, he would pack up his briefcase, knowing that he had at least done something.&nbsp;<br /><br />The third area in dealing with things of eternity is to strengthen home and family.&nbsp; If you are already married, use this as a time to nurture your marriage, to set patterns of family scripture study, family prayer, family home evening and father's interviews.&nbsp; If you are engaged, I offer my congratulations.&nbsp; If you are engaged, but don't yet have a temple date - get with it and set one!&nbsp; And if you are just not there yet, can I encourage you to seek diligently - and ye shall find - especially you young men!&nbsp; As I served as a Young Single Adult branch president for 7 &frac12; years, I used to detest the term "hanging out."&nbsp; I would tell the brethren in the elders quorum that they could "spend quality time" in groups during the week, but on the weekend, I wanted them out on a date holding hands with one girl.&nbsp; If you are concerned with rejection or fearful to take the first step, have faith!&nbsp; Fear didn't hold you back in the mission field because you were on the Lord's errand and He gave you strength.&nbsp; In all you do, prepare to be good husbands and fathers. &nbsp;Live the charge of the Hymn:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Rise up, O men of God,Have done with lesser things, [including incessant computer games]Give heart and soul and mind and strength,To serve the King of Kings.&nbsp;<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>He will bless you in this part of your life as well.&nbsp; I pray for you in this great endeavor.&nbsp;<br /><br />And for you sisters who would give anything to be married and have a family, I honor you for who you are, and for the miraculous work you do - in developing your own talents and touching the lives of those around you.&nbsp; As a father of five daughters, I am the product of good women, just like you - a wonderful, angel mother; a faithful and loving wife; and five beautiful daughters; and six granddaughters!&nbsp; Thank you, each of you, for all you do!&nbsp;<br /><br />The fourth suggestion I have in your time of preparation is to live the standards in the&nbsp;<em>For The Strength of Youth</em>&nbsp;brochure.&nbsp; I carry it with me wherever I go, and suggest that you do the same.&nbsp; These standards are not just for teenagers.&nbsp; When you have a moment of waiting, pull it out, read it and re-commit to living its standards.&nbsp; A number of years ago, a young woman just your age was out on a date with a young man.&nbsp; They had been out several times before.&nbsp; This time they went for a ride - west of town.&nbsp; As they rode, it got darker and darker, until it was completely dark.&nbsp; It was at this time as they were on a deserted country road about seven miles from town that the young man pulled over to the side of the road, turned off the engine, took off his glasses, and moved over to the side of the car where this young woman sat.&nbsp; At that point she said, "Stop!&nbsp; I am not that kind of girl.&nbsp; Take me home - now - or I will walk."&nbsp; She later told me that he moved back over to the driver's seat, started the engine, turned on the lights, pealed out onto the road and drove 90 miles an hour down that little country road.&nbsp; "I thought we were going to die," she said.&nbsp; They arrived at her apartment on campus. &nbsp;He slammed on the brakes, she got out and he sped off - and she never saw him again.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have often thought about the courage that must have taken for her on that lonely, dark country road - where none would have known what happened - none but she and that young man - and a kind Heavenly Father.&nbsp; I am grateful for that simple decision made on that dark country road so many years ago - for it made all the difference - for that young woman became the mother of our five daughters.&nbsp; And it was natural for me, when I took each of them in my arms to give them a name and a blessing, to bless them that when they struggled, they needed only to look to the example of their mother.&nbsp; Four - live the standards in the&nbsp;<em>For the Strength of Youth</em>&nbsp;brochure.&nbsp;<br /><br />My fifth suggestion: &nbsp;learn to control your thoughts.&nbsp; There is a war going on that is normally not covered by any of the major media - a war not of guns and tanks, but a war for the lives and souls of our youth - including you, the young adults of the Church!&nbsp; And it begins in the minds of today's young members of the Church.&nbsp; In his final talk recorded in the book of Mosiah, King Benjamin taught the saints in his day:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.&nbsp; But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith..., even until the end of your lives, ye must perish.&nbsp; And now, O man, remember, and perish not."&nbsp;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>This war for the minds of Latter-day Saints becomes even more intense with the introduction of the electronic media - television, DVDs, the internet, iPhones, Kindles, Droids, iPads, and the list goes on and on.&nbsp; Now, my message to you is not to give up the media and move to Stites, Worley, or Wardner, Idaho and assume you'll run away from it all.&nbsp; There have been some who have done that, but, if you move to a place like that for that reason, as a friend of mine used to say, "you'd better have one of the Three Nephites on your side when you make that decision."&nbsp; Jonah tried to run and it didn't work, and it won't with you or with me.&nbsp;<br /><br />No, the key is to learn responsible use of each medium and to learn how to control your thoughts.&nbsp; May I offer two simple suggestions:&nbsp; first, get rid of any visual image that would draw your mind and your thoughts away from that which is good and true and right.&nbsp; I am not suggesting that you do away with all pictures in your room or home or iPhone or your computer screensaver that don't have to deal with the Savior and temples.&nbsp; Rather, I am suggesting that you pray for the Spirit and then ask yourself, "Does that picture or poster lift, inspire or motivate me? Or does it drag me down?"&nbsp; If you have to remove some wall hangings, you might replace them with a picture of the temple or good art.&nbsp; And each of us will be different.&nbsp; In my study I have a picture of a banjo.&nbsp; To me, as a banjo player, that is inspiring.&nbsp; For most others...well, I'll just leave it at that.&nbsp;<br /><br />You might even consider putting together your own personal Hall of Heroes, including a picture of each hero and a small paragraph of why he or she is a role model for you.&nbsp; Surround yourselves with that which lifts and inspires you to be your better self.&nbsp; As a young man, I loved to listen to Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass - all instrumental music.&nbsp; However, one album was released entitled "Whipped Cream." The music was fine, but the album cover showed a young woman completely covered in whipped cream and not much else.&nbsp; As a young teenage boy, for some reason, that image didn't seem like something that would inspire so I covered it with a picture of an antique auto - and there it has stayed now for some 45 years.&nbsp; Surround yourselves with uplifting graphic reminders of who you are and what inspires you!&nbsp;<br /><br />I have also learned that it is possible to control our thoughts by that which we memorize or take into our minds.&nbsp; A wise man once said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If one wishes to improve his speech and be an inspiration to his friends, let him read the scriptures, poetry and other good literature with such concentration as to impress upon his memory the best of what he reads.&nbsp; To store in one's memory select passages and to add daily to that store is to live constantly in the presence of the best.&nbsp; That which we value enough to memorize becomes part of us."&nbsp;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Years ago, Sister Dahlquist returned excitedly from a BYU Education Week class and suggested that we start learning poetry as a family.&nbsp; So as part of our daily family seminary, we began to include a poetry memorization component.&nbsp; The first poem that we memorized was:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Keep a poem in your pocket, and a picture in your head,And you'll never be lonely, At night when you're in bed.&nbsp;<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>We learned a number of others over the years. And if those five little girls were here with me today, though they are grown, they would remember most of them.&nbsp; What is important is not that they are always prepared with a talk or an inspirational thought - which they are, but that when they are discouraged or tempted, they have filled their minds with that which is good and right and positive and uplifting - and it will carry them through some pretty difficult times.&nbsp; When I was in Berlin several years ago, I toured Hohensch&ouml;nhausen, a Russian prison.&nbsp; It was a horrible and very dark experience.&nbsp; When we left the prison, I asked our guide, Herr Eberhart Zaun, how he ever survived.&nbsp; He said, "When things got really bad, I recited portions of Shakespeare plays that I had memorized as a youth."&nbsp; I asked, "What about those who had not memorized uplifting quotes as a youth?"&nbsp; He replied, "They soon lost hope and died."&nbsp; I am convinced that being able to control our thoughts by that which we treasure up in our minds is, indeed, a lifesaving work.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, finally, in the midst of your preparation, remember, that this is also a time for serving and giving and sharing and ministering to those in need.&nbsp; I hope you learn early that service is not just a project but a way of life!&nbsp; And service in the Kingdom is more than just fulfilling your calling with diligence.&nbsp; It is responding to a person in need now!&nbsp; It is fulfilling a need now.&nbsp; I recall the story of President Kimball's visit to a stake conference.&nbsp; They had taken a break from their long stake presidency meetings with Elder Kimball.&nbsp; One of the members of the stake presidency went into the men's restroom and to his horror, found that someone had pulled all the paper towels out of the dispenser and had then tossed them all over the floor - probably an energetic 4 year old!&nbsp; He immediately started out to find someone to clean up the mess.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As he was leaving the restroom, he passed President Kimball, just coming in to the restroom.&nbsp; Without a word, President Kimball stooped down and began to pick up the papers and place them into the wastebasket.&nbsp; We serve because there is a need, and we serve now.&nbsp; We open a door, give a kind word, deliver a loaf of bread, pick up a piece of paper on the lawn on campus, straighten a rug, or even simply smile at someone in need, just because of a perceived need.&nbsp; I learned that from a father who always had the worst looking front bumper in the state of Idaho because he was always giving some car along the highway a push.&nbsp; I am grateful for his quiet example of spontaneous service.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was a stake president, there was a young man by the name of Jim Sirrine in our stake.&nbsp; As I recall, Jim was not particularly talented, not particularly athletic or gifted, but, like the rest of us, a normal garden-variety member of the Church.&nbsp; One evening, his ward youth decided to do a food drive for the homeless.&nbsp; They met at the Church, had a prayer, and then sent each youth, with a little wagon, out to collect cans of food from those who lived within the ward boundaries.&nbsp; They were to return in 45 minutes and the one with the most cans of food in their wagon would win a prize.&nbsp; They all left for their stations and returned at the appointed time.&nbsp; Jim returned a few minutes late but with an empty wagon.&nbsp; The other youth chided him, and asked him if he has gone to get a drink at the local 7-Eleven.&nbsp; Jim just laughed and went over and quietly sat down.&nbsp; The attention of the youth soon turned to the many cans of food, and seeing who was the winner with the most cans collected.&nbsp;<br /><br />As they counted the cans, a member of the bishopric, Brother Whitehead, went over and sat down next to Jim.&nbsp; He quietly said, "Jim, I have a feeling that something happened out there tonight that you didn't tell us about."&nbsp; Jim explained that he was about ready to return with his wagon full of cans, when he decided to go to one more home.&nbsp; He rang the bell and a lady came to the door.&nbsp; He explained to her what they were doing and asked if she would be willing to contribute.&nbsp; She said it was a wonderful project, and said she would be right back.&nbsp; In a moment, she returned with two cans of food.&nbsp; Jim thanked her, put the cans in his wagon, bade goodbye and began down the walk.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Jim then said, "As I got half-way to the street, I had the strangest feeling, and I turned around and returned to the door.&nbsp; Again I rang the bell.&nbsp; When she answered, I said, 'Ma'am, I don't know you and you don't know me, but as I was leaving here, I had the strangest feeling that you need this food more than where I am taking it.&nbsp; And so I have decided to leave it here with you.'"&nbsp; As he said that, she burst into tears and just sobbed.&nbsp; Well, what does a teenage boy do when a grown woman begins to cry? What does a grown man do when a grown woman starts to cry? So he just began to unload the cans on her porch and left.&nbsp; As he finished the story, Jim said, "Brother Whitehead, I may never know why she needed that food so badly, but I know that it was the right thing to do."&nbsp;<br /><br />As I heard that story, I thought, what a wonderful thing that Jim was prepared to hear the voice of the Holy Ghost speak to his soul as it invited to spontaneously serve.&nbsp; Jim knew who he was, and because he did, he was a pure vessel in the hands of the Lord to bless the lives of that woman and her family.&nbsp; I love the poem by Myra Brooks Welch:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">'Twas battered and scarred,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the auctioneer thought it scarcely worth his while</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To waste his time on the old violin,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But he held it up with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"What am I bid, good people," he cried,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Who'll start the bidding for me?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A dollar, a dollar, and who'll make it two?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Two dollars and who'll make it three?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Three dollars once, three dollars twice,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And going and gone, but no.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">From the room, far back, a grey-haired man</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Came forward and picked up the bow.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And wiping the dust from the old violin,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And tightening the loose strings,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He played a melody pure and sweet</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As sweet as the angel sings.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The music ceased, and the auctioneer</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In a voice that was quiet and low,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Said, "What am I bid for the old violin?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he held it up with the bow.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A thousand, a thousand, and who'll make it two?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Two thousand and who'll make it three?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Three thousand once, three thousand twice,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And going and gone," said he.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The people cheered, but some of them cried,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We do not quite understand</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What changed its worth?"&nbsp; Swift came the reply:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The touch of the Master's hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And many a man with life out of tune</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And battered and scarred by sin,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Much like the old violin.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;A mess of pottage, a glass of wine,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A game, and he travels on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He's going once, he's going twice,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He's going and almost gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Can't quite understand</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The worth of a soul and the change that's wrought</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By the touch of the Master's hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You and I are the ones that are the Master's hands, because most of the miracles, unlike that which happened with Paul and unlike that which happened with Alma the Younger, generally-happen through others, through you and through me - if we are prepared.&nbsp;<br /><br />God bless you and God bless me that we might all be prepared, that we might rise up and be true Latter-day Saints, that we might strengthen this great world, that we might use this time to strengthen ourselves that we might be prepared to accomplish our individual missions here on the earth. I testify to you that God lives. This is His work. He knows you by name, He hears your prayers and He will answer them in His own time, often in unexpected moments as we are about His business. That I know, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon my dear brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Sister Rasband and I are honored to be here in this beautiful and newly dedicated building, and to share this time with you. This is a marvelous learning institution, and I commend each of you for the time you spend attending this great school.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;This is a beautiful building.&nbsp; I am overwhelmed at the magnitude of this structure.&nbsp; What a wonderful blessing it will be to all who come here.&nbsp; As I have looked over this newly dedicated edifice, and have observed the fine and outstanding craftsmanship, it brought to mind a little parable President Boyd K. Packer shared in April of 2000, at the dedication of the Conference Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Packer said:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Do you think it possible for those of us who are called upon to speak to draw attention away from this wonderful building long enough to focus on the purpose for which it was built? &nbsp;Perhaps it can be done with a parable...&nbsp;<br /><br />"A merchant man seeking precious jewels found at last the perfect pearl.&nbsp; He had the finest craftsman carve a superb jewel box and line it with blue velvet.&nbsp; He put his pearl of great price on display so others could share his treasure.&nbsp; He watched as people came to see it.&nbsp; Soon he turned away in sorrow.&nbsp; It was the box they admired, not the pearl."<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Certainly this is a most beautiful building, but we all will want to be careful not to lose site of the reason we are here, and for which it was built, "to strengthen students spiritually, academically, physically and socially."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; Each of you are building toward your futures, and will be forever grateful for the knowledge that you gain here.&nbsp;<br /><br />University time can be one of the happiest times of your life; especially if you work hard and take advantage of the many opportunities that are here for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When it came time for me to select a university of my choice, some of the campuses I would have liked to have chosen I could not qualify for.&nbsp; Not academically, because I had worked through high school more than I had studied, nor financially, because I just could not afford to live away from home.&nbsp; Hence, the option I chose was to attend the University of Utah, where I could live at home, work locally, and attend school full time.&nbsp; I am most grateful for my alumni status at the "U" and will always be appreciative for the fine education I received there.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have a lot of fun when our family gets together for the ball games.&nbsp; My children have all attended BYU-Provo.&nbsp; Between the games, teasing, and cheering, life can get pretty exciting as the red and the blue meet on the field.&nbsp; Needless to say, when the U wins a game over BYU, I, for just a brief moment, get to raise the red flag in victory for my team!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I am pleased to say that I have a few of my family and friends attending BYU-Idaho, who have joined here with us in this devotional.&nbsp; It has been special for Sister Rasband and I to have had the opportunity to share a little time with them today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I have many fond memories from my experience at the U.&nbsp; First and foremost was meeting my eternal companion Sister Rasband. If nothing else would have happened there, it would have all been worth it to meet and marry Melanie. We were married in the Salt Lake Temple and moved into married student housing at the U. &nbsp;I would suspect that sounds familiar to many of you here today.&nbsp;<br /><br />While I was at the University of Utah, I had the blessing of serving as the Elders Quorum President in one of the married student wards.&nbsp; There I met my dear friend and mentor, and future employer and partner, Jon M. Huntsman.&nbsp; I was 24 years old at the time, and he was my high council advisor.&nbsp; I will be forever grateful to the Lord, for being in the right place at the right time, as our meeting changed my life forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Sister Rasband and I also had the special privilege of meeting countless numbers of wonderful young people.&nbsp; We developed choice, Christ-centered relationships with them that still continue to this day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure each of you are making friends and life-long acquaintances here at BYU-Idaho, just as we did in our early life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As I have pondered and prayed on what I should share with you in the next few minutes, I have felt impressed to address a subject I struggled with and did not understand well myself as a young man, but have come to know is very important in each of our lives. With the help and guidance of the Lord, I would like to share with you a message on talents and abilities.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now before you say in your minds:&nbsp; "I don't have any talents, or I don't know what my talents are," let me share with you that everyone has been blessed with many marvelous capabilities and talents.&nbsp; One of the great objectives of our journey through mortality is to improve upon them. The Savior powerfully taught this lesson in His parable of the talents.&nbsp;<br /><br />A few days before His Crucifixion, Jesus took His disciples to a place on the Mount of Olives overlooking the city of Jerusalem<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;and gave what is known as the Olivet discourse.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The quiet and panoramic setting was wonderfully suitable for the Savior to teach His disciples of the destruction of Jerusalem and the signs of His Second Coming. As He spoke, His words distressed the disciples. Jesus tried to comfort them, saying, "Be not troubled, for, when all these things shall come to pass, ye may know that the promises which have been made unto you shall be fulfilled."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />As a part of this sermon Jesus gave several parables. In the Prophet Joseph Smith's inspired translation of the Bible, the Prophet made it clear that these parables refer to the last days.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus told the story of a master who gave each of his three servants a sum of money. The amounts were set according to each servant's previously demonstrated capabilities. The man then left for a long time. When he returned, he asked each of these servants to report what he had done with the money.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first two servants revealed they had doubled his investment. "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,"<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;was the master's reply.&nbsp;<br /><br />The third servant then came trembling before his master. He had already heard what the others had reported and knew that he could not give a similar report. "I was afraid," the servant said, "and went and hid thy talent in the earth."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The master was upset. "Thou wicked and slothful servant," he said. Then he commanded, "Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In modern revelation the Lord affirmed the principles in this parable: "But with some I am not well pleased, for ... they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of man. "...Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp; These are very solemn words spoken by the Lord and worthy of our consideration today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes we have a fear of using our talents.&nbsp; We use excuses such as "I know I can't do that," or "someone else can do it much better than I," or "those listening to me, or watching me, will criticize and judge me."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Again, let me read the words of the Lord:&nbsp; "But with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of man. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />President James E. Faust spoke on this subject, and gave this profound counsel.&nbsp; He said:&nbsp; "We may wonder whether it was fair to take the talent from the one who had the least and to give it to the one who had the most. From the outset, however, the Lord explains that each man had ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Some of us are too content with what we may already be doing. We stand back in the 'eat, drink, and be merry' mode when opportunities for growth and development abound. We miss opportunities to build up the kingdom of God because we have the passive notion that someone else will take care of it. The Lord tells us that He will give more to those who are willing. They will be magnified in their efforts..."&nbsp; "But to those who say, 'We have enough,' from them shall be taken away even that which they have."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Prophet Joseph Smith, through revelation recorded:&nbsp; "...that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold..."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Every person comes to earth as a unique individual. Similar threads may run in families, but each of us has a tapestry all our own. Elder Bruce R. McConkie (1915-85) of the Quorum of the Twelve wrote: "Each person in this life is endowed with those talents and capacities which his pre-earth life entitle him to receive. Some by obedience to law acquired one talent and some another..."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord made it clear that it is not good enough for us simply to return to Him the talents He has given us. We are to improve upon and add to our talents. He has promised that if we multiply our talents we will receive eternal joy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our dear President Hinckley said this about the importance of our talents:&nbsp; "You cannot afford to waste your talents or your time. Great opportunities lie ahead of you."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />It is so important to identify and put into practice each day, the talents we have each been blessed with.&nbsp; However, we must also be cautious and use our talents wisely in building up the kingdom of God here upon the earth.&nbsp; We need to engage in the activities, service, and lifestyle that will help to strengthen and protect our talents to be used righteously.&nbsp; As an example, let me share with you counsel from Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Satan can also attack us where we think we are strong-in the very areas where we are proud of our strengths. He will approach us through the greatest talents and spiritual gifts we possess. If we are not wary, Satan can cause our spiritual downfall by corrupting us through our strengths as well as by exploiting our weaknesses."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Robert D. Hales, of the Quorum of the Twelve, also addressed this very subject when he stated:&nbsp; "Too often, however, those who possess great talents are selfish and do not use their gifts for the benefit of others. And more importantly, they do not acknowledge that these gifts are God-given. If we properly understood the source of our creative talents, there would be no application of writing, dancing, music, or photography for Satan's purposes. The prophet Moroni wisely counsels us about using our talents for evil. He exhorts us to 'come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing.'"<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Hales further goes on to say:&nbsp; "It would seem that our Creator approves of and would encourage us to develop our creative gifts and talents. In section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants, we are told to '<em>seek ... earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given;...</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />'For all have not every gift given unto them;&nbsp;<em>for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />'To some is given one, and to some is given another,&nbsp;<em>that all may be profited thereby.</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />... 'And all these gifts come from God,&nbsp;<em>for the benefit of the children of God.'</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />"This scripture tells us that it is not wrong to seek earnestly for the best gifts if we do it for the right reasons."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Applying the teachings of the parable of the talents has been a challenge and a great blessing in my life. I would like to share with you three principles which have been a great help to me in my efforts with this process.&nbsp;<br /><br />First,&nbsp;<strong><em>Seek earnestly to discover the talents the Lord has given you</em></strong>. The talents God has given us first become apparent in the interests we pursue. If you are wondering about your talents, make a list of the things you like to do. Include all the activities you enjoy from different dimensions of your life-spiritual, musical, dramatic, academic, athletic, and so on. Study and ponder your patriarchal blessing for insights and inspiration.&nbsp; Consult family members, trusted friends, teachers, and leaders; others often can see in us what we find difficult to see in ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Sister Rasband, throughout our life together, and Brother Huntsman in my many years of working with him, helped me in this effort.&nbsp; They saw in me gifts and talents that I did not recognize in myself.&nbsp; Choose wisely your friends and mentors, as they will help you identify the gifts and talents you have been blessed with.&nbsp; Listen to your parents and grandparents.&nbsp; They know you well and we are never too old to take the counsel of those who have already travelled the road we are now on.&nbsp;<br /><br />Eldred G. Smith, former Patriarch to the Church, gave this wonderful counsel:&nbsp; "Everyone has inherent talents. From a study of your [Family History] genealogy, find the talents you have inherited by the things you like to do, and do easily, that some of your ancestors have done. Then become an expert or a specialist in some phase of that field. The Lord will bless your efforts in your studies and in your daily work."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In this day and time, when Family History work has become so accessible to everyone, it would be well to look into the lives of your ancestors.&nbsp; Perhaps you will find a vast amount of information that will help you in recognizing the gifts and talents you have been blessed with.&nbsp;&nbsp; In many cases, you will find that you have many of the same talents as those who have gone on before.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Spencer W. Kimball said: "God has endowed us with talents and time, with latent abilities and with opportunities to use and develop them in His service. He therefore expects much of us, his privileged children."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;Let me reassure you my young brothers and sisters, each one of you has been blessed with special talents.&nbsp; Each of you has been blessed with divine talents by our Father in Heaven. He is waiting for you to identify, develop, and magnify those talents He has blessed you with.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President James E. Faust said:&nbsp; "As sons and daughters of God, we are obligated to develop as many of our divinely given talents as we can...You will be happier if you know who you are and feel good about yourself."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I remember a wonderful Primary teacher who frequently invited me to read the scriptures in front of the class. I was not comfortable reading in front of the other children.&nbsp; She told me what a nice reading voice I had and how well I read. What she said and the way she encouraged me helped me gain confidence and realize one of my talents from the Lord at an early age.&nbsp; I have often thought since then, that one of her great talents was to help children, especially me at that time, gain the self assurance needed to accomplish, what seemed to be, a very frightening assignment.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a 19-year-old missionary, I yearned to know if I had been blessed with any helpful missionary-related talents. I felt a great desire to know how I could magnify whatever gifts I had so that I could be a more effective servant of the Lord. As I studied the scriptures and my patriarchal blessing, prayed fervently, and had various missionary experiences, several of my talents were made known to me. These talents, identified and strengthened as a missionary, bless me in my ministry to this very day.&nbsp;<br /><br />The second principle I would like to share with you is:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Use your talents to build up the kingdom of God</em></strong>, and I don't just mean the Church. Our first priority in building the Kingdom is in helping others in our own family. Parents are in a unique and powerful position to encourage and support their children in developing their talents. Siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, extended family members; we all have many opportunities to help others identify their talents. I am grateful for the many people who have helped me add to my talents. The successes in life of those we assist, sponsor, mentor, and lift as they pursue their own talents can bring us great joy and satisfaction.&nbsp;<br /><br />Focusing on serving the Savior can guide us toward making proper decisions in our daily lives. This perspective prepares us to do whatever the Lord may ask of us at any time. President Gordon B. Hinckley exemplified this important attitude: He said: "My talents may not be great, but I can use them to bless the lives of others.&nbsp; I can be one who does his work with pride in that which comes from hand and mind."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />President Spencer W. Kimball said:&nbsp; "Let us remember, too, that greatness is not always a matter of the scale of one's life, but of the quality of one's life. True greatness is not always tied to the scope of our tasks, but to the quality of how we carry out our tasks whatever they are. In that attitude, let us give our time, ourselves, and our talents to the things that really matter now, things which will still matter a thousand years from now."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Our beloved prophet, President Thomas S. Monson has said:&nbsp; "Expand your knowledge, both intellectual and spiritual, to the full stature of your divine potential. There is no limit to your influence for good. Share your talents, for that which we willingly share, we keep. But that which we selfishly keep, we lose."<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The third principle I would like to share is:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Acknowledge God's hand in your success</em></strong>. We must never forget or stop acknowledging that all talents and abilities come from God. Some were given to us before our birth, while others have been acquired as we have developed. However, in both cases, they are gifts from a benevolent Heavenly Father, whose gracious blessings are also the means for improving our talents and obtaining others. The Lord has said, "And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is His wrath kindled, save those who confess not His hand in all things."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Many years ago, Elder Marvin J. Ashton, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, shared these powerful and inspiring words:&nbsp; "It pleases God to have us humbly recognize his powers and his influence in our accomplishments rather than to indicate by words or innuendo that we have been responsible for remarkable achievements."<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Robert D. Hales, of the Quorum of the Twelve, counseled:&nbsp; "Prayer is an essential part of conveying appreciation to our Heavenly Father. He awaits our expressions of gratefulness each morning and night in sincere, simple prayer from our hearts for our many blessings, gifts, and talents."<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Now in closing, I would like to share with you for a moment an experience in our family's life about a special baby boy who was sent to this earth with a very special gift and talent from his Heavenly Father.&nbsp;<br /><br />This little boy is our grandson, Paxton.&nbsp; Paxton was born in July of 2010. He was born with a rare chromosomal defect which has him in a life-threatening condition. Paxton spent the first four months of his life in the newborn intensive care unit of the Primary Children's Medical Center.&nbsp; Through much faith, fasting, priesthood blessings, and countless prayers, he is now at home with his parents and two brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Whenever I am near Paxton, I can feel the strong spirit of love and peace that he radiates.&nbsp; The medical teams who have watched over him each day also commented on the spirit this little boy carries.&nbsp; And even with all of his challenges he now faces, he has brought a sweet peace to his parents and big brothers.&nbsp; Paxton has brought our family so close together, and has taught each of us about the important things in life, things that really matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Paxton has and continues to teach us what President Uchtdorf so beautifully taught in the October 2010 General Conference when he said: "...we would do well to slow down a little, proceed at the optimum speed for our circumstances, focus on the significant, lift up our eyes, and truly see the things that matter most."<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />That is the special gift this little boy was born with, teaching all of us the important things in life--"things which will still matter a thousand years from now."<sup>29</sup>&nbsp; This is truly Paxton's special gift he will carry throughout his life.&nbsp; We thank our Father in Heaven for each day we have with this special little baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I am thankful for the knowledge the Lord has given us-that we are His children and that we are to magnify and multiply our talents to our fullest potential.&nbsp;<br /><br />The experiences you have each day, if you will allow them to be, can and will be stepping stones that will help to shape each of your lives, as they have mine.&nbsp; They will assist you in finding your gifts and talents that will be used as you progress through mortality here upon the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is my humble prayer, my brothers and sisters, that we will seriously ponder and pray to find our talents.&nbsp; That we may use them in building up the Kingdom of God here on the earth, that we may be found worthy to stand before the Lord at the last day and in His presence hear Him say:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>President of the BYU-Idaho 9th Stake</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, it is an honor to be asked to address you today at this devotional. A few years ago, when Sister Call and I brought our family to Rexburg to begin our experience on the faculty at BYU-Idaho, we were not certain of what to expect as we came.&nbsp; I had spent the previous 23 years of my teaching career at various Institutes of Religion in Virginia, Utah, and Idaho teaching and loving the young adults of the Church that attended the various institutes where I was asked to teach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first day at the university was the day that the First Presidency announced that Kim B. Clark would serve as the new president of BYU-Idaho. As these past five years have quickly passed by, it has been my privilege to have had thousands of students participate in classes I have been assigned to teach and I have found that these students are so very much like the wonderful young adults that I had taught in the Institute classes. You are wonderful young people with a great and prophesied future, I congratulate you on the position you now have as students at this place. I have watched as the university, under the leadership of President Clark, has instituted several programs designed to increase enrollments and improve teaching at this university. I have been a witness of the hand of the Lord directing the affairs of this great university. It has been a wonderful thing to watch and participate in the great things that have happened here in our tenure.&nbsp; Sister Call and I are grateful to be here and to be a part of Brigham Young University-Idaho.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have listened carefully over the years to several devotional talks by apostles and prophets, President Clark and others teaching us and admonishing us to improve ourselves and to become the disciples of Christ that our Heavenly Father would want us to be. The counsel given was always accompanied with the feeling of love and concern that helped us all to know that it was for our best good. In all of the pleading and persuasion that was used, I always felt a need to improve my own life as I tried to help others to live up to the high standards expected of BYU-Idaho students, faculty and other employees. To improve and become what I had been asked to become by our leaders, I needed improvement in my testimony and greater conversion to the gospel needed to occur. Though I was not rebellious, my desire was to become completely converted and live up to my commitments to the Lord and to my employer. I knew that if I was completely converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ that all other commitments and promises I have made would be fulfilled because I would have become the disciple that God would have me be.&nbsp;<br /><br />Conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ is an ongoing process that we have been striving to perfect all of our pre-mortal and mortal lives. We all participated in the war in heaven, defending, testifying, and battling the adversary in the cause of Christ. In that skirmish, with eternal consequences hanging in the balance for each of us, we stood firm as witnesses of the plan of the great Elohim and defended our moral agency with our might. It was a difficult time, but our faith prevailed. President Hinckley talked of that time and our current situation.&nbsp; He stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"What a perilous time that must have been. The Almighty Himself was pitted against the son of the morning. We were there while that was going on. That must have been a desperate difficult struggle, with a grand triumphal victory. Concerning those desperate times the Lord spoke to Job out of the whirlwind and said: 'Where wast thou when I laid the foundations for the earth? ...When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?' (Job 38:4,7). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Why were we then happy? I think it was because good had triumphed over evil and the whole human family was on the Lord's side. We turned our backs on the adversary and aligned ourselves with the forces of God, and those forces were victorious. But having made that decision, why should we have to make it again and again after our birth into mortality? I cannot understand why so many have betrayed in life the decision they once made when the great war occurred in heaven."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>All of you fought valiantly in those pre-mortal battles because of your "exceeding faith and good works."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Many became "noble and great ones"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;who were "chosen in the beginning to be rulers in the Church of God...and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Our valiancy in the pre-mortal sphere was a determining factor as to when we would come here to this earth and perform our work in the kingdom to bring about salvation for ourselves and many other of God's children. Based on the degree of our pre-mortal valiancy, God foreordained his righteous spirit children, those who were converted before the foundations of this earth to do, to say and to become what the Lord would have them become. Though foreordained by a loving and omniscient God, we come to this earth as the Lord said to Abraham, that "we might prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Conversion in the pre-mortal life was a necessary component for our gaining a mortal body. Only those converted to the Plan of Salvation, to one degree of valiancy or another, were permitted to have the blessing of a mortal body.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since coming to this earth we are challenged to gain control over the mortal tabernacle through obedience to the spiritual dimension we all come with or the light of Christ. As the spirit gains more and more control over our mortal appetites, passions and addictions, the ability to follow the teachings of Jesus become more fully embedded in our lives. This control comes as we follow the process of conversion established by our Father in Heaven as we came to this earth. Conversion as defined in the Bible Dictionary "denotes changing one's views, in a conscious acceptance of the will of God." The Bible Dictionary continues:&nbsp; "If followed by continued faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism in water for the remission of sins, and the reception of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, conversion will become complete, and will change the natural man in to a sanctified, born again, purified person - a new creature in Christ Jesus. Complete conversion comes after many trials and much testing."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The true convert to the gospel must go through a process or patterns which appear to have a least three elements of spiritual development. They are 1) conscious acceptance of the Lord's will; 2) be a sanctified, purified person who has been born again; and, 3) experience much trial and tribulation.&nbsp;<br /><br />First, as in all circumstances, the Lord Jesus Christ is the perfect example of doing the Lord's will in all things. As Christ approached the wondrous, but agonizing atonement, his prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane included these words, "...Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:&nbsp; nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;In describing the depth of pain that the Savior experienced, Joseph Smith was taught in Doctrine and Covenants 19 about the suffering. We read, "Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit - and would that I might not drink the bitter cup and shrink -"<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;In the most critical and important moment in eternity, the Lord Jesus Christ did not turn away from doing the will of the Father. As in every other requirement given him of the Father, Jesus of Nazareth obeyed. His conversion was complete and endless.&nbsp;<br /><br />Next, the true convert will become sanctified, purified, and born again. The sanctification process requires our willingness to yield our hearts to God.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;As we do so, we change in our desires from the natural, carnal state to one where we become truly desirous of being pure in all our thoughts and actions. Alma the Younger had a wonderful and great manifestation in his life at a time he was leading many others to follow after false and wicked teachings. Now, most of us will not necessarily be involved in such visions of angels sent from God, however each of us must go through the "born again" experience as we proceed through the conversion process. Alma recites, in part, his experience and some of what he learned. Please turn with me to Mosiah 27:24-26:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit. And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters; And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God."</p>
<p>This concept of being born again is taught repeatedly through the scriptures as a necessary change for those seeking to come unto Christ. The Savior taught Nicodemus, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;This change of being born again results, as Alma just wrote, in one becoming a "new creature." Becoming a new creature entails truly giving up all things in our lives which are contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Elder Richard G. Scott has taught us, quoting President Marion G. Romney, that:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>Converted</em>&nbsp;implies not merely mental acceptance of Jesus and his teachings but also a motivating faith in him and his gospel. A faith which works a transformation, and actual change in one's understanding of life's meaning and his allegiance to God in interest, in thought, and in conduct. In one who is really wholly converted, desire for things contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ has actually died. And substituted therefore is a love of God, with a fixed and controlling determination to keep his commandments."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conversion then is the process of becoming a sanctified, purified, born again disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />The third and last element of conversion teaches us that trial, adversity, and testing are part of the process for our needed conversion. It was only after such testing and trial of Peter, that Peter was able to fulfill the Savior's injunction to him at the Last Supper to strengthen his brethren after his own conversion.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Elder Dallin H. Oaks has taught that:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Our needed conversions are often achieved more readily by suffering and adversity than by comfort and tranquility...Father Lehi promised his son Jacob that God would 'consecrate [his] afflictions for [his] gain (2 Nephi 2:2). The Prophet Joseph was promised that 'thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high' (D&amp;C 121:7-8).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Most of us experience some measure of what the scriptures call 'the furnace of affliction' (Isa. 48:10; 1 Ne. 20:10). Some are submerged in service to a disadvantaged family member. Others suffer the death of a loved one or the loss or the postponement of a righteous goal like marriage or childbearing. Still others struggle with personal impairments or with feelings of rejection, inadequacy, or depression. Through the justice and mercy of a loving Father in Heaven, the refinement and sanctification possible through such experiences can help us achieve what God desires us to become."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overarching these three elements of conversion is the wonderful power of the Holy Ghost helping, leading, and guiding each of us to do the will of the Father and become in the sanctified and purified form what the Lord would have us be. As Elder Scott has taught, "the Holy Ghost will help identify the personal changes you need to make for full conversion."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;What a great advocate we all have been given, that when lived for in our lives becomes such a powerful agent in our conversion process. Without the Holy Ghost the mighty change required for full conversion to the gospel plan would not be possible. For each of us, our necessary conversion is a series of deep personal, intimate experiences in which we submit and yield to the spiritual promptings of the Holy Ghost. The result of these efforts leads each of us to that level of conversion where as Alma explains that "they never did fall away."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />As we look within our own lives and our spiritual development especially as members of the kingdom of God on the earth, we must ask the question, "What motivates me to do the things that I do to further the kingdom and my own spiritual self?"&nbsp; I suppose there are many factors which cause us to act, for certainly we are "to act and not to be acted upon" as we make our way through this life. In teaching priesthood leaders, President Gordon B. Hinckley linked together what motivates us in our lives and true conversion. He taught those leaders by saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...<em>we should&nbsp; be concerned with the spiritual dimension of our people and the enlargement of this dimension</em>...there is a tendency to impose quotas behind which usually lies imposition of pressure to achieve improved statistics.&nbsp;<em>In the work of the Lord there is a more appropriate motivation than pressure. There is the motivation that comes of true conversion.&nbsp;</em>When there throbs in the heart of an individual Latter-day Saint a great and vital testimony of the truth of this work, he [meaning, of course, men and women] will be found doing his duty in the Church. He will be found in his sacrament meetings. He will be found in his priesthood meetings. He will be found paying his honest tithes and offerings. He will be doing his home teaching. He will be found in attendance at the temple as frequently as his circumstances will permit. He will have with him great desire to share the gospel with others. He will be found strengthening and lifting his brethren and sisters. [in others words, he will be committed.]&nbsp;<em>It is conversion that makes the difference</em>."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, the true convert of Christ has become one who is willing to do the will of the Lord through fulfillment of assignments and showing the Lord he is desirous of doing all things which the Lord shall command. When service in the kingdom and toward our fellowman is something that is sought for and eagerly accomplished and is no longer viewed as a drudgery or a burden of any kind, then we may know that a person has become what the Lord desires him to become and conversion has taken place.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Identifying the True Convert</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Although there are many traits that make up the character and mindset of the true convert to the gospel of Jesus Christ, I would like to discuss six traits of conversion that seem important for each of us to develop as we proceed to the conversion process. They are: 1) the true convert desires to share the gospel of Christ with his fellowman; 2) the true convert desires to repent of their sins; 3) the true convert accepts and follows the words of living prophets and the scriptures without question; 4) the true convert sees the "power of God resting upon leaders of the Church and follows them; 5) the true convert has a feeling of healing peace upon him; and, 6) the true convert loves all mankind.&nbsp;<br /><br />First, the true convert desires to share the gospel of Christ with his fellowman. It appears that from the very moment of their conversion, the four sons of Mosiah sought to take the gospel to those who knew not of the truth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble...And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many days that they might go up to the land of Nephi."<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>The mighty change which had occurred to them caused a conversion in their desires. It happens to us in the Church today. Elder Oaks has said, "The intensity of our desire to share the gospel is a great indicator of the extent of our personal conversion."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Returned missionary after returned missionary will testify of the truthfulness of this principle as they have served with dedication in their assigned fields of labor. Elder Robert D. Hales taught concerning the truly converted that: "Their minds and hearts are centered on the Savior's atoning sacrifice. From the moment of their respective conversions, Enos, Alma the Younger, Paul and others turned wholeheartedly to the task of bringing themselves and their fellowmen to God."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma testifies that the desire of his heart was that he were a angel so that he might declare unto every soul repentance and the plan of redemption. Indeed, once one has been converted they desire to help and strengthen those who are without the gospel in their lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second, the true convert desires to repent of his sins. When we begin to understand that we must be clean and pure to come into the presence of God, we start to understand our status as sinful men will not allow us to live with him. When we proceed with our personal conversions, we realize that becoming a new creature means giving up all of our sins to know God and Jesus Christ. King Lamoni's father in the Book of Mormon perhaps represents the best attitude of repentance a true convert must have toward sin. Said he, "...and I will give away all my sins to know thee..."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Though his conversion may have occurred quickly, this humble man realized that repentance was the only way to true happiness. Elder Richard G. Scott said, "...true conversion is the fruit of faith, repentance, and consistent obedience."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />As our personal conversions become more firm our need to repent over seemingly small things becomes more intense. You will remember a tender story told by President James E. Faust:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As a small boy on the farm..., I remember my grandmother...cooking our delicious meals on a hot woodstove. When the wood box next to the stove became empty, Grandmother would silently pick up the box, go out to refill it from the pile of cedar wood outside, and bring the heavily laden box back into the house."</p>
<p>President Faust's voice then filled with emotion as he continued:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I was so insensitive...I sat there and let my beloved grandmother refill the kitchen wood box. I feel ashamed of myself and have regretted my [sin of] omission for all of my life. I hope someday to ask for her forgiveness."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>President Faust's emotional duress even many years after the event deepens our understanding of our need to repent over all thoughts, actions, words or deeds which oppose the will of God. Our conversion process continues over our lives until we have become perfect even as Christ is perfect.&nbsp;<br /><br />A third identifying characteristic is that the true convert accepts and follows the words of living prophets and the scriptures without question. Undoubtedly, one of the greatest conversion stories in all scripture was the conversion of a group of Lamanites who later took upon themselves the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehis. This group of converts is remarkable in that their family traditions taught of hatred toward the Nephites and thus the gospel teachings. They had been taught by Ammon and his brethren "...by the power and word of God, they had been converted unto the Lord."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Additionally, the Book of Mormon indicates that by "reading the scriptures unto the king" and then begin to "expound unto him the scriptures,"<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Aaron and his brethren brought these thousands of Lamanites to the truth from which they "never did fall away."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />This conversion was so complete that these true converts of the gospel "laid down the weapons of their rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war."<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Without question, in their lives they had become new creatures. The power of the word of God was so strong that they had chosen to become what the Lord wanted them to become. Later, the prophet Alma will testify that "the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which is just-yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them..."<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Often, to really see the effects of true conversion on a society, we only need look at their children to see if they have accepted the truths of their parent's generation.&nbsp; Some of the descendants of the original Anti-Nephi-Lehis are the 2,000 stripling warriors. When their parents were about to break the sacred oath and take up weapons of war, these young men stepped forward and volunteered to go to battle to preserve their freedoms, families, and religious liberties. They had been taught by their mothers specifically to "...keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him."<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;The remarkable trait that these young men exhibited was exactness in their obedience to their prophet leader, Helaman: "Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness. Yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them..."<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The story does not end with this scripture. Because of their obedience, and&nbsp; "...according to the goodness of God...there was not one soul of them who did perish."<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Although each warrior was wounded in some way, and some very seriously, these young men, who believed their parents and were converted, were preserved. Perhaps we in our dispensation can learn a great lesson of conversion and obedience from these young men.&nbsp; Elder M. Russell Ballard taught in General Conference in April 2001:&nbsp; "Today I make you a promise. It's a simple one, but it is true. If you will listen to the living prophet and apostles and heed our counsel, you will not go astray."<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />A fourth identifying characteristic is that the true convert sees the "power of God resting upon the leaders of the Church" and follows them. A seemingly consistent theme in the Church is that the only thing constant in the Church is change. So it is with our leaders, not only at the local level, but also at the general level. It becomes the responsibility of every member of the Church to receive testimony of the mantle of leadership on our current living prophets. At the death of Joseph Smith, a miraculous thing occurred in Nauvoo, which helped the Church members know that Brigham Young was to succeed Joseph in the presidency of the Church. Our Church history indicates that on Thursday, August 8, 1844 a prayer meeting was held in Nauvoo, Illinois. In the meeting, Sidney Rigdon spoke for one and a half hours concerning his desires to be guardian of the Church. After his speech, Brigham Young spoke for a short period of time and while speaking was miraculously transfigured before the people. He took on the persona of Joseph Smith in voice and appearance. As one present later wrote, "...I knew in a moment the spirit and mantle of Joseph was upon him."<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The true convert must feel the mantle of our church leaders at all times.&nbsp; President Harold B. Lee spoke of what it means to be converted:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now I want to impress this upon you. Someone has said it this way, and I believe it to be absolutely true: 'That person is not truly converted until he sees the power of God resting upon the leaders of this church, and until it goes down into his heart like fire.' Until the members of this church have that conviction that they are being led in the right way, and they have a conviction that these men of God are men who are inspired and have been properly appointed by the hand of God, they are not truly converted."<sup>33</sup></p>
<p>As we come to believe that our leaders speak for God, our conversion to doing the will of the Father increases as we follow carefully the teachings of the prophets. Our personal and family prayers become times of inspiration, our scripture study provides answers to our most intimate questions, family home evenings no longer are a chore but a joy, we find ways to avoid debt, feelings of entitlement leave our thinking, and we take the Church's position on all moral issues as they come along. These are just a few of the ways we acknowledge our true discipleship. It defines what we have become and our conversion to the true God of heaven and his teachings. President Ezra Taft Benson taught in this vein:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If we are living the gospel, we will feel in our hearts that the First Presidency of the Church not only have the right, but are also duty bound under heaven to give counsel on any subject which affects the temporal and spiritual welfare of the Latter-day Saints, regardless of whether or not some men may think such counsel may have political implications.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We must stand firm for that which we know to be right, my brothers and sisters, and uphold these men who have been sustained as our leaders in modern Israel."<sup>34</sup></p>
<p>The days ahead of us are prophesied to be some of great dilemma, a trial of our faith, where men's hearts will fail them. For those who look to the Brethren for direction and then heed the call, then they like the sons of Helaman may have some wounds and injuries, but because they are true converts will not be a casualty in the war with Satan.&nbsp;<br /><br />The fifth characteristic that I would like to identify is that the true convert has a feeling of healing peace upon him. Christ's words to the survivors of the great devastations that occurred on the American continent at the Savior's crucifixion were these: "O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than they, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?"<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;Repentance leads to conversion, which leads to the healing hands of the Lord upon us. In testifying to his son Helaman about his own conversion, Alma the Younger explains that it was not until he did cry unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy that he did receive a remission of his sins and found that peace to his soul that he had been desperately seeking.<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />It appears that to His disciples, the Savior's great intensity to share peace with us may be best exemplified at the Last Supper when to his apostles of that meridian dispensation he promised: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubles, neither let it be afraid."<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />This deep peace is found in the converted. Certainly three Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, had this conversion peace as they faced and experienced the fiery furnace of Babylon; Abinadi as he stands before Noah felt peace and commitment; Paul as he stands before Agrippa was full of the peace that only true conversion can offer; as Joseph Smith begins that awful trek to Carthage, he testified saying, "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer's morning. I have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward all men." What a great peace, borne of conversion, was with these great men. However, I think most of us would perhaps more identify with a "rank and file" member of the Church named Joseph Millett.&nbsp;<br /><br />After serving a difficult but fulfilling mission to Canada, Brother Millett returned to his home with a strong testimony of the Lord and a peace borne of conversion in his soul. Years later, Brother Millett, now the father of a large family was suffering through very, very difficult times. In his journal he wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"One of my children came in and said the Brother Newton Hall's folks was all out of bread, had none that day."I divided our flour in a sack to send up to Brother Hall. Just then Brother Hall came."Says I, 'Brother Hall, are you out of flour?'"'Brother Millett, we have none.'""'Well, Brother Hall, there is some in that sack. I have divided and was going to send it to you. Your children told mine that you was out.'""Brother Hall began to cry. He said he had tried others, but could not get any. He went to the cedars and prayed to the Lord, and the Lord told him to go to Joseph Millett."'Well Brother Hall, you needn't bring this back. If the Lord sent you for it you don't owe me for it.'"</p>
<p>That night Joseph Millett recorded a remarkable sentence in his journal:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"You can't tell me how good it made me feel to know that the Lord knew there was such a person as Joseph Millett."<sup>38</sup></p>
<p>This is the peace of the Savior that can and must needs be in each of us continually. Not because we are entitled to it as bespeaks our conversion from the pre-mortal life, but from what we have become in the mortality we all experience now.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A sixth and last identifying characteristic of the truly converted is the love that he has and exhibits to all mankind. To the crowd on the Mount of Beatitudes the Savior challenged the masses to "love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you..."<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;What a challenge! What great self-restraint and discipline! But conversion requires us "becoming" something much greater than the natural man tendency that resides in each of us. Elder Hales has taught: "The scriptures confirm that the truly converted do more than just forsake the enticements of the world. They love God and their fellowman."<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />This pure love forsaketh the things of the world. It lifts and edifies not only the convert of Christ but all that come into contact with him. The converted disciple of Christ desires to be obedient with exactness to the commands of God as they come from Him. The Holy Ghost magnifies the feeling of love in the converted to the point of charity. At that point the desires of the convert of Christ become as Christ's and full conversion can be complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To me it seems that the truly converted disciple of Christ would show a wonderful attitude of appreciation for all the great things he or she has received from the Lord. Remember the true characteristics of the true convert help us look out of ourselves to God and to our fellowman and not inward to the selfishness of man.&nbsp;<br /><br />I close with a wonderful story of what I consider to be a true convert of the Lord Jesus Christ. This story was shared by President Gordon B. Hinckley at General Conference:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I met a naval officer from a distant nation, a brilliant young man who had been brought to the United States for advanced training. Some of his associates in the United States Navy, whose behavior had attracted him, shared with him at his request their religious beliefs. He was not a Christian, but he was interested. They told him of the Savior of the world, Jesus Christ, born in Bethlehem, who gave his life for all mankind. They told him of the appearance of God, the Eternal Father, and the resurrected Lord to the boy Joseph Smith. They spoke of modern prophets. They taught him the gospel of the Master. The Spirit touched his heart, and he was baptized."He was introduced to me just before he was to return to his native land. We spoke of these things, and then I said, 'Your people are not Christians. What will happen when you return home a Christian, and more particularly, a Mormon Christian?'"His face clouded, and he replied, 'My family will be disappointed. They may cast me out and regard me as dead. As for my future and my career, all opportunity may be foreclosed against me.'""I asked, 'Are you willing to pay so great a price for the gospel?'""His eyes, moistened by tears, shone from his handsome brown face as he answered, 'It's true, isn't it?'""Ashamed at having asked the question, I responded, 'Yes, it's true.' To which he replied, "Then what else matters?'"<sup>41</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As one who is striving to be a fully converted disciple of Jesus Christ, I declare that there is nothing else that matters but to stand boldly and nobly in defense of truth. May each of us be willing to stand as witnesses of Christ and then when we are converted strengthen those around us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emeritus First Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Alvin Mickelsen</strong>&nbsp;has been a&nbsp;general authority&nbsp;of&nbsp;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&nbsp;since 1990.<br /><br />Mickelsen was born in&nbsp;Idaho Falls, Idaho&nbsp;on July 21, 1935. As a young man, he was a&nbsp;missionary&nbsp;in the Church's&nbsp;Central AmericanMission&nbsp;when it spanned from&nbsp;Guatemala&nbsp;to&nbsp;Panama.</p>
<p>Mickelsen studied at&nbsp;Ricks College&nbsp;and&nbsp;Brigham Young University. He graduated from BYU in 1966 with a degree in agricultural economics. After this, Mickelsen operated a&nbsp;potato&nbsp;farm in Idaho and also was involved in shipping potatoes.</p>
<p>Mickelsen has served as a&nbsp;bishop,&nbsp;stake president,&nbsp;regional representative, and as&nbsp;president&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Colombia&nbsp;Cali&nbsp;Mission. In 1990, he became a member of the&nbsp;Second Quorum of the Seventy. At the time of his call, he was serving as a&nbsp;temple&nbsp;worker in the&nbsp;Idaho Falls Temple, assigned to work in&nbsp;Spanish. In 1993, Mickelsen was transferred to the&nbsp;First Quorum of the Seventy.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2004, Mickelsen worked with&nbsp;Jay E. Jensen&nbsp;and Enrique Resek in supervising the preparation and publication of an&nbsp;LDS edition of the Bible&nbsp;in Spanish, using as their base text the&nbsp;Reina-Valera Translation&nbsp;of the Bible.<sup id="cite_ref-1"></sup></p>
<p>Elder Mickelsen married Jeanine Andersen in the Idaho Falls Idaho temple on June 17, 1960. &nbsp;They have nine children.</p>

<p><strong>What is relevant to you today?</strong><br /><br />When I came to this campus in 1953 there were approximately 1,100 students. The administration building, the gym building and some army barracks we called the sheep sheds would have fit in this building with room to spare. It was primitive compared to today's standards but the spirit of the restored gospel that broods over this campus has continued to prevail. Some of the most important lessons of my life were gained here. The most important decision of my life was made here, for this is where I found my eternal companion. The purposes for this university have not changed. You will learn many of the most vital lessons of life and many of you will find or have already found your eternal companions here.&nbsp;<br /><br />I marvel at the maturity of this student body. It seems to me you are years ahead of where we were at this point in our lives. The direction of the curriculum and the individual responsibility you have been entrusted with is unheard of in the world of education. I would like to talk to you today about how you can make the most of your time here. I envy you! What a marvelous time you live in, and what a happy time this should be. I don't want to live my life over-it has been full and wonderful-but from my perspective, BYU-Idaho students have never had it better.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The chosen generation</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />From the time I became a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood I remember hearing from Church leaders that we were the "chosen generation," that we were among the spirits held back to come forth in this last dispensation. We were told that great responsibility would rest upon us to prepare the way for the coming of the Savior, that no one had ever faced the challenges we would face, and that no one had ever been equipped to handle them as we were. I confess my feelings upon hearing this were mixed. There were days I believed what we were told, and other times I suspected it was hyperbole, words spoken with the intention to get us to behave better than the previous generation. Now that I am in a position to do the preaching, I admit to some hyperbole, but I say with conviction that the Lord meant what He said: that "even before [you] were born, [you], with many others, received [your] first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>So how do you become chosen?</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />From the beginning of creation, our Father in Heaven has singled out from among His children those He has referred to as chosen. We can be chosen by birthright, through the covenants we make, or both. Abel was chosen, for it was said of him that he&nbsp;<em>hearkened</em>&nbsp;unto the voice of the Lord. . . . And the Lord had respect" for his sacrifices.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Because Cain wanted it&nbsp;<em>his way,</em>&nbsp;he was not counted among the chosen and rebelled against God. After Cain killed Abel, Adam and Eve prayed for a worthy son, and Seth was born after the image and likeness of Adam. Seth was called chosen, and his sacrifices were acceptable before the Lord. Being born after the image and likeness of Adam, he looked like him, but more importantly, he acted like him. He was chosen because of the way he chose to live.&nbsp;<br /><br />Throughout time, the Lord has chosen righteous servants to carry out His work. Noah pronounced Shem the chosen of his three sons, and in his patriarchal blessing although he was not the eldest, he received&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the promised blessings of the birthright. Through the lineage of Shem came Abraham. The Lord made a covenant with Abraham: "I will . . . multiply thee exceedingly. . . . Thou shalt be a father of many nations."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;The covenant included the priesthood and great responsibility that through his seed "all the nations of the earth [would] be blessed."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The responsibility of being chosen</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />There is a bit of irony in being chosen. One might suppose that being chosen makes a person better than others, yet the Lord has made it clear He is no respecter of persons. What does it mean, then, to be chosen? Peter spoke of "a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people;" (that doesn't mean strange, although it could; but in Greek the word means purchased. To become chosen one must be purchased by the atonement of Christ) Peter went on to say, "that&nbsp;<em>ye should shew forth the praises of him&nbsp;</em>who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;To those who are chosen, the Lord has always opened the heavens to that marvelous light. The promised light includes understanding the plan of salvation and participation in the covenants and blessings from God. It includes the blessings of the priesthood and the key of the knowledge of God and exaltation. That marvelous light comes through the Holy Ghost. Those who have not enjoyed that experience of light and knowledge through the Holy Ghost ridicule those who have, because they cannot produce empirical evidence to substantiate their knowledge. Notwithstanding the disdain of skeptics, we have that knowledge, and with that marvelous light we have great responsibility. The Lord said, "Of him unto whom much is given much is required; and he who sins against the greater light shall receive the greater condemnation."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The Holy Ghost and the marvelous light</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior promised His disciples that when He left, they could continue to learn from the Holy Ghost, who would "teach [them] all things, and bring all things to [their] remembrance, whatsoever [He had] said unto [them]."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;The Prophet Joseph Smith, in explaining the Godhead, said the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit so He can dwell in us.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;As he dwells in us that marvelous light is increased and he works as the agent to cleanse us of sin and confirm truth to our minds and our hearts as we hear it or read it. It is through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost that we come to know the things of God.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Inspiration and agency</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />There is an interesting dichotomy between inspiration and agency. The Lord has made it clear: He will inspire, He will guide, He will prompt, He will teach, but He will not&nbsp;<em>choose</em>&nbsp;for us. Oliver Cowdery thought that getting inspiration and guidance would be easy. The Lord simply does not work that way. First we must "study it out in our minds," and then&nbsp;<em>&shy;we</em>&nbsp;must decide.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;It is with the exertion of studying out that inspiration comes. It is through our earnest seeking and thinking that the Holy Ghost can speak to our minds. Part of that deliberation is formulating the right question in our minds so we can then ponder and seek the answer to the question. When we have made a preliminary decision and settled on a solution or answer, we then take it before the Lord. He has promised us a confirmation of our decisions through a burning in our bosom if it be right, or a stupor of thought if it be wrong. A stupor of thought affects each of us in different ways; it may come as a complete brain cramp-when you can't think of anything. I remember some of those times here at BYU-Idaho when I had not studied adequately for an exam. Of course, if an exam is multiple-choice you can always guess. But the important questions of life are essay questions, and you either know or you don't.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Asking the right question</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />In 1972 we had a large family and a very small home. We had seven children under the age of 12 and only one bathroom. Our five girls shared a single bedroom. We had the opportunity to move to a much larger and nicer home that was also closer to my work. It seemed like a simple, uncomplicated decision. It meant a change in ward, stake, and school, but that didn't seem important in light of the advantages. I spent two frustrating months considering the move. I was learning about stupors of thought. I finally decided to take the problem to the Lord in a serious way. I determined I wouldn't eat until I made a clear decision. For three long days the same frustrating ideas went through my mind. Finally, I asked the right question-not about money and convenience but about family and Church. The next morning in the shower I knew we should stay and made the decision. The calm peace that "passeth all understanding"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;came over me, and I knew it was right. I didn't know why, I just knew. I learned two months later, when I was called to be the stake president. The Lord, of course, knew all along. I just had to ask the right question.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The Light of Christ</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition to the blessing of the Holy Ghost, our Father in Heaven has provided another marvelous resource to guide us in our choices. When Elohim confronted Lucifer in the Garden of Eden, He said to him, "I will put enmity between thee and the . . . seed [of the woman]."<sup>11</sup>We feel this enmity toward Satan through the Light of Christ. The Light of Christ plants within our hearts a natural hostility toward Satan and his followers, who have set about to frustrate the plan of God. The Light of Christ is given to every man, and it is what makes sin repulsive to the honest in heart. The goodness, the innocence and faith, the disgust at the sight of sin, and the honesty of a little child is the personification of that enmity. If we follow the Light of Christ, it becomes one of the most precious possessions that we hold. However, if we persist in rejecting His inviting and enticing, we can lose that help, for the Spirit "will not always strive with man."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The meaning and purpose of agency</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>The Light of Christ</em>&nbsp;gives us the foundation in choosing between good and evil.&nbsp;<em>The Holy Ghost</em>&nbsp;is our teacher. Together, they will guide us toward the light, but the choice is ours, with no compulsion. The purpose of our existence is to develop the character and capacity to make right decisions; it is based on the eternal principle of agency that began in our pre-mortal existence. I believe it was just as difficult to make right decisions then as it is now. There was as much uncertainty then as we face now. We had to be decisive, to make up our minds. We chose right in the War in Heaven; otherwise we wouldn't be here.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Agency and eternal life</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Explaining the meaning and purpose of agency, Lehi told Jacob that if there were not opposition in all things, it would destroy the wisdom of God and His eternal purposes.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;A life without opposition would be a life without agency, and without agency there could be no progression. But because of agency there can be progression. Lehi continues: "Men are free according to the flesh. . . . They are free to choose liberty and eternal life," through the Atonement of Christ, or "captivity and death, according to the . . . power of the devil."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;God gave man agency that he could act for himself, which he could not do if he were not enticed by one or the other.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Agency is the essence of eternal life, for eternal life, or God's life, cannot be, if there is no agency. Or in other words, if we make our agency eternal through right choices, then through the grace of Christ we will have eternal life.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Man is free to choose eternal life (which is an eternal continuation of the right to choose) or eternal death, wherein we can no longer choose. One choice perpetuates agency; the other terminates it.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;When we make wrong choices the door of opportunity closes behind us. If we continue in error, the doors keep closing until the night of darkness comes when agency is lost and no labor can be performed.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>We will prove them herewith</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord said through Abraham, "We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;I have no doubt you are among the noble and great ones Abraham saw, but that is not a&nbsp;<em>free pass;</em>&nbsp;you will have to prove yourselves. The choices we make always determine the outcome or consequence. The Lord has given us commandments to guide us. That seems simple enough. The rub is to make the right decisions. That will require the application of&nbsp;<em>faith</em>. To even know there is a God requires&nbsp;<em>faith</em>. Faith is the basis of our obedience to God. It follows that faith is an important part of making&nbsp;<em>right</em>&nbsp;decisions.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Exercise of faith</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />With each decision we exercise our faith. That expression-<em>exercise faith</em>-has always intrigued me. I know what exercise means in a physical sense. Physical exertion causes us to sweat. But exercise of the mind and will, the exercise of the spirit is harder to understand. With greater uncertainty, greater faith is required. Perhaps every decision, to be consistent with God's plan, requires an element of faith. The real exercise of our faith and spirit comes when we make decisions out of our comfort zone. At this time in your lives, you are weighed down with decisions outside of your comfort zone. If you are single you have a marriage decision ahead of you. If you are married you have homes to buy and children to bring into the world. You wonder, "How will I support my family?" These decisions you face today will require the exercise of faith. We exercise our faith by stepping into the darkness. If we step with faith surely the light will follow. The courage to take that step is based on the evidence and the substance we have added to our faith by earlier stretching.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>If you have practiced that procedure, you will be<strong>&nbsp;</strong>decisive and boldly step into the darkness, knowing the light will follow.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Mature faith, pure knowledge</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>When our faith has matured, making the right decision in spiritual things is automatic; it requires little effort, for when you are standing in the light the decision is clear. The choice has already been made.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high mountain, where he was able to see all of creation, from the beginning to the end. When he came down from his great vision, Satan came tempting him. He appeared as an angel of light, claiming to be the Only Begotten. (He can do that, you know.) But Moses was not deceived, for he said: "[The Spirit of the Lord] hath not altogether withdrawn from me. [Therefore,] I can judge between thee and God."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;When we have the Spirit of the Lord with us, the decisions are easier, for, with that light, the difference can be as clear as the day from the darkest night.<sup>21</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Time of uncertainty</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>We live in the information age. With a keystroke or two you can access information that, when I was here, would have taken hours of research in the library. These are also very uncertain times, in part because of the flood of contradictory information. What is truth, and what is propaganda? What is right? What is wrong? Isaiah saw this day and declared, "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!"<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;During the American Revolution, Thomas Paine declared: "These are the times that try men's souls." He spoke of summer soldiers and sunshine patriots who chose to "hide and watch," to wait and see.<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;We have our choice today. We must never be sunshine Mormons or summer Saints.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>This is not a time to wait and see</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>This is not a time to wait and see. This is a time of decision. Unfortunately many of us go through life knowing the things we should do but failing to make the decisions that allow us to act. We put off important decisions until they require a quick or impulsive answer.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Early in life our choices and decisions were guided by our parents, teachers, or Church and political leaders. My father died 19 years ago. I miss him. I miss him because there was great certainty in his counsel. It is always comfortable to have someone validate your decisions, but the most important thing is to learn to make right decisions yourself.&nbsp;<br /><br />Following the gospel plan trains us in making decisions. Through the gospel we receive God's commandments, and we choose to obey or disobey. As we make the right spiritual choices our capacity to make right decisions increases in every facet of life. You are here at school to learn how to make right decisions from the experience of others. Going to school is for your temporal life like studying the scriptures is for your spiritual life.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The season of decision</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In teaching missionaries I counsel them to make up their minds about what they intend to do when they grow up, and I teach them that this decision will help them to be better missionaries. In Mexico, one of the elders, obviously a very bright young man, asked, "You mean you want me to take time out of my missionary service to make that decision?" I asked, "How much time do you need?" He replied, "At least a week of fasting and prayer so that I can know the will of the Lord in that important choice in my life." My answer surprised him, as it may surprise some of you. I said, "Elder, I don't think your career matters to the Lord as long as you keep the commandments and prepare to serve Him; your career is your decision." I don't mean to imply we should not confirm that kind of decision with the Lord, but I believe He expects us to go through the process of making the decision first. I received a letter from Tyler Seibert last October thanking me for the challenge that set his feet on the path to a very happy and successful career. &nbsp;Elder Bruce R. McConckie told a group at BYU in Provo about meeting the girl he would later marry. "When I saw Amelia," he said, "I knew what I wanted. I didn't have to ask the Lord." Then in reflection he said, "I guess I could have confirmed that with the Lord, but it was clear to me."&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Indecision is no choice at all</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Becoming decisive is part of our spiritual growing up. This growing up requires constant decision making. We must learn to be decisive for indecision is no choice at all, and if we fail to choose, we fail to act. With no action, the second law of thermodynamics takes over. That law, simply stated, is that without power or energy applied, things tend to deteriorate. The easiest path is always followed unless we choose otherwise. The Lord expressed it this way: "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it."<sup>24</sup>And "wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;This is a life-or-death issue. To overcome this entropy requires power. That power is generated by faith, as we become decisive and follow the narrow way.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The most important choices</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />There are two kinds of decisions we make in our lives. The critical decisions determine our standing before our Eternal Father. These decisions have to do with eternal truth, and the Holy Ghost can confirm the rightness of our choices. There are many other decisions that don't make a difference in our standing before the Lord, but they are schoolmasters that help us to learn and gain experience. These are noncritical decisions like "What color shirt should I wear today?" (For me that is easy; with my assignment it is always white.) We should make those decisions, learn from them, and move on. A wrong decision in the noncritical department may embarrass us or cause some other discomfort, but it will not affect our standing before the Lord.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The non-negotiables</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The critical decisions have to do directly with the gospel, the plan that the Father has given us to guide us back to His presence. Those decisions are eternal in consequences and require non-negotiable commitments. These are the "I will never" and "I will always" parameters that will accelerate our progress and build in a powerful protection when we are tempted to stray from the celestial path. I knew a young man who exemplified this. He overcame difficult physical obstacles in order to fulfill his life's dream-to serve a mission. At his farewell his father said, "My son will not make many decisions on his mission"-I wondered where he was going with that statement; then he said, "Because he only makes a decision once." We all need to be like that.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The Thomas paradox</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>These non-negotiable commitments give us greater access to the Holy Ghost to build and strengthen testimony. A testimony of the gospel goes beyond believing to a profound certainty that comes through personal spiritual witness. As Latter-day Saints we are surrounded by the truth and the testimonies of others. In that insulated environment we run the risk of depending on others for our certainty. We can find ourselves caught in what I call the Thomas paradox. Thomas had spent three years with the Savior, yet when Jesus told His Apostles He was leaving and was going to prepare a place for them, Thomas said, "We don't know where you are going; we don't know how to get there."<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Contrast Thomas's indecisiveness with the testimony of Peter, when the Savior asked him, "Who do you say that I am?" Peter declared, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." Then the Savior confirmed Peter's source of knowledge: that flesh and blood had not revealed that to him, but the Father which is in heaven.<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;If we will be decisive in our desire for personal witness, we can know just as Peter knew.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The step of faith</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In San Antonio, Texas, I met a man who had married a faithful Latter-day Saint girl. He was not a member of the Church, so they made an agreement that they would not discuss or argue about religion. His wife was true to her commitment, but shortly after they were married the missionaries came calling. He remained true to his commitment and didn't argue or complain, and the missionaries just kept coming. He went through so many sets of missionaries he lost count. Three years went by, but he still remained indifferent to the gospel. He was a good man; he was just not willing to expend the faith necessary to believe. One evening he came home from work, and his wife said, "The missionaries are coming tonight." He thought to himself, "Oh, no. Not again! Haven't I been through this enough already?" But that night was different. There was an older stake missionary with the elders, and as they began the lesson he said to this man, "John, It's time you joined the Church. You need to make the decision now!" He heard himself saying, "I know; you're right. It is time." As he said those words, he felt a powerful confirmation of the Spirit and knew it was true. He said to me, "I really didn't know until that moment, but then I knew with a confirmation that I could not deny." His one step of faith into darkness opened the door to the confirming Spirit.&nbsp;<br /><br />I rejoice in the principle of agency. I am grateful for opposition that helps us grow. So what happens when we make wrong choices? With mistakes in everyday temporal decisions, opportunities are lost, there may be physical or mental discomfort, but these consequences can be overcome, and the experience gained is valuable to our development. If we make wrong choices in keeping the commandments the consequences are far more serious. You have heard of the gates of hell. When we disobey the commandments of God, we suffer spiritual death. We cannot return to His presence without help.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is a trap used to catch pigeons. It is a wire cage with a hinged gate that only swings to the inside. As the pigeon eats the feed on the perch,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>he focuses his appetites on the food and blissfully walks through the gate, finding himself trapped. The gate will not swing out. The gates of hell are like that. If we follow our carnal appetites and commit sin, in effect, we pass through that gate and suffer spiritual death. We are powerless to open it, but the Master can and will if we will repent.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>How to get out</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>There are those who suppose that the Judgment will be like a graph and if the good we have done is greater than the bad, all is well. But with only one un-repented sin, we will suffer spiritual death. James said, "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." If we have one un-repented sin the Savior will not, he cannot open the door to salvation for us.&nbsp;<br /><br />How I love our Savior. I know he suffered spiritual death for us if we will leave behind the wrong choices we make and follow Him. We can become the "new creature" through Him.<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;I know that is what He wants, and above all else that is what I want.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emeritus First Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p><strong>Charles Amand Andre Didier</strong>&nbsp;(born 5 October 1935) has been a&nbsp;general authority&nbsp;of&nbsp;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&nbsp;since 1975. A native&nbsp;French&nbsp;speaker, Didier was the first&nbsp;European&nbsp;resident called as a General Authority in the Church's history.<br /><br />Didier was born in&nbsp;Brussels,&nbsp;Belgium, the eldest son of Andr&eacute; Didier and Gabrielle Colpaert. At age 22, Didier was&nbsp;baptized&nbsp;a member of the Church in Brussels. Three months later, he received the&nbsp;Aaronic Priesthood&nbsp;and was ordained to the office of&nbsp;deacon. Nine months later he was ordained a&nbsp;teacher&nbsp;and after another four months, Didier became a&nbsp;priest. Two years after his baptism, Didier received the&nbsp;Melchizedek priesthood&nbsp;and was ordained to the office of&nbsp;elder.<br /><br />Prior to his call as a General Authority, Didier was&nbsp;president&nbsp;of the Church's&nbsp;France-Switzerland&nbsp;Mission&nbsp;and a&nbsp;regional representative. In October 1975, President&nbsp;Spencer W. Kimball&nbsp;called&nbsp;Elder Didier to become a member of the&nbsp;First Quorum of the Seventy.<br /><br />In 1984, when the church's first&nbsp;area presidencies&nbsp;were created, Didier was made president of the South America North&nbsp;Area, which included&nbsp;Brazil&nbsp;as well as the&nbsp;Spanish-speaking&nbsp;nations of&nbsp;South America&nbsp;from&nbsp;Peru&nbsp;north.<sup id="cite_ref-1"></sup><br /><br />On 15 August 1992, Didier became a member of the&nbsp;Presidency of the Seventy. He served in this position until 15 August 1995, simultaneously serving as the general president of the church&nbsp;Sunday School&nbsp;program in 1994 and 1995. In 2001, he was again called to serve in the Presidency of the Seventy. Until his second release from the Presidency of the Seventy in 2007, Didier's responsibilities included overseeing the Church's operations in the North America Southwest Area. In 2007, Didier was assigned as president of the Church's newly consolidated Brazil Area. Didier was designated as an Emeritus General Authority in the October 2009&nbsp;General Conference.<br /><br />Didier is married to Lucie Lodomez and they are the parents of two children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recently we celebrated the beginning of a new year. As part of this celebration, I received close to 100 Christmas and New Year's cards, not counting the e-mail wishes from many family members and friends from all over the world. As I was opening and reading the messages, I noticed that the majority of the cards carried a printed message written in bold letters: "We wish you a Happy New Year," replacing the familiar wish and song "We wish you a Merry Christmas!"<br /><br />There seems to be a new trend nowadays to avoid any reference to religion or to discriminate, and many of the new messages read like this: "Warmest thoughts and best wishes for a wonderful holiday and a very happy new year." Well, I didn't know the difference between normal thoughts and warm thoughts-maybe a hot shower-and it did not give me the recipe to enjoy a very happy new year! And so, by curiosity, I became a seeker of true happiness, and I want to share with you what I discovered.&nbsp;<br /><br />I started by asking myself, "What is the meaning of a 'very Happy New Year?'" My first thought was to define happiness according to my own thinking, a tempting but dangerous approach as we are surrounded and deeply influenced by the world's philosophy and definition of happiness. So I went to the dictionary for help, hoping to find the answer from the wisdom of the learned.&nbsp; The definition read: "happiness, a state of well-being and contentment." A thought came directly to my mind about the mailing of New Year's cards for next year. Why not suggest to my friends that they enclose a $100 bill with their card and the wish for a very Happy New Year! That would surely be a good beginning for my well-being and contentment as most of us know how money can help solve a lot of issues and desires! Could money possibly be a key to happiness?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To my surprise, under the heading of money, the dictionary indicated that money cannot buy happiness, among other things. Too often we are tempted to think that temporal satisfactions like those promoted by the media and businesses may give us the expected well-being and contentment for feeling better, looking better, eating better, living better, and even dying better!&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with believing this, but at the same time, we recognize that this contentment is always short lived and does not bring lasting happiness. How can we then obtain long-term happiness?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />After consulting the dictionary, I wanted to find the opinion of people who wrote about happiness. One of them, Chateaubriand, a well-known French writer of the 19th century, even a participant in the American Revolution, wrote: "All the souls don't have an equal aptitude to happiness." This is an interesting thought inferring that happiness is related to agency, which is the ability and freedom to choose good or evil and accountability, which is the process of assuming the consequences of our choices and actions resulting from agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Another one, Elder Dean L. Larsen, a former President of the Seventy, wrote: "Accountability has to do with one's exercising his own will to make decisions and follow a course of conduct.&nbsp; It implies self-initiative and a measure of self-reliance, but it requires more than the ability to act for one's self. It must be guided by knowledge of true principles."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In my short search for knowledge of the true principle of happiness, I concluded that there were in fact two sources to find it: one, coming from the temporal world, a secular source; the other, coming from the spiritual world, a divine source. The worldly message can be summarized in one word:&nbsp;<em>hedonism</em>, which is "the doctrine that pleasure or happiness is the sole or chief good in life." It might be called "the great plan of pleasure" and is short lived. On the other hand, the divine message is shared by the prophets, seers and revelators, representatives of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, His beloved Son. It is called "the great plan of happiness"<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;or "the great and eternal plan of redemption."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;It is long lived.&nbsp;<br /><br />We discover then, thanks to the scriptures, that there is a God and that He desires that we find real, lasting happiness versus the unreal, short-term happiness offered by the devil. By revelation we know that our mortal and immortal happiness is the purpose of this life and that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of this world who made the Atonement to achieve eternal happiness.&nbsp; His gospel reveals the true plan of happiness. Thus, to be truly happy is to know the Lord's plan received by revelation, to obey His commandments, and to live His gospel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This is or becomes our continual mortal challenge, being subjected or affected constantly by the external conditions of the world, for which we may not be directly responsible but for which we pay the consequences. In fact, your present life in college and your future life thereafter should not depend on the environment or other circumstances affecting you. The agency that you have been given is the determining factor of success related to happiness or failure, which is, of course, related to unhappiness. Happiness or unhappiness is thus the result of a choice. It is a matter of decision; it is a matter of learning by faith and then exercising personal discipline.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let us take a brief look at the external conditions of the world that are affecting us lately. We are witnessing a revolution in values with its primary characteristics being a militant secularism, not a benign agnosticism, but a hostile rejection of religious faith. Last month an article was published in the opinion column by a leading newspaper in Salt Lake City titled "Empirical evidence against a supreme being." Listen to this short quote that underlines the militant secularism of its author: "Scientifically, the Bible is wrong from the very first sentence, and goes downhill from there. . . . There is no empirical evidence for an omniscient Supreme Being."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Belgian sociologist Ron Lesthage defines this revolution as a retreat from the values affirmed by Christian teaching, such as responsibility, sacrifice, altruism, and sanctity of long-term commitments like marriage and childbearing, toward an all-pervasive individualistic secularism centered on the desires of the self.&nbsp;<br /><br />In comparison to the decadent and ever-changing conditions of the world, let us now turn to the edifying, revealing, and permanent true values and principles that were given by revelations to prophets so that one can become a humble seeker of true happiness and feel, as the scriptures say, "exceeding joy or being swallowed up in the joy of God."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Where do we start? Learning by faith the values and principles of truth. What is truth?&nbsp; "And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;In the spring of 2008, President Kim B. Clark confirmed the core characteristic of this great institution, BYU-Idaho, as he quoted this revelation given to Joseph Smith: "Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom, seek learning even by study and also by faith."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;President Clark then concluded: "We must realize that vision by helping students find temporal and spiritual truth through focused study and righteous action based on faith in Jesus Christ."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />So, confronted between spiritual knowledge and other temporal, rational, or so-called politically or intellectually correct statements trying to usurp revelation, the words of Alma are applicable today as they were during his time: "And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Skillfully questioning and attempting to destroy the reality of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, is not new in the history of mankind. The very subtle affirmation by some that one cannot deny the existence of a God, but one cannot believe that there is a God,<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;reminisces of the tactics used by too many detractors of the believers of ancient times like the antichrist Korihor arguing with the high priest Giddonah: How can you believe in an unknown "being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Thus, Christ becomes a myth and not a fact. It always seems that the testimony of a factual, resurrected, living Christ cannot be accepted as it is or as it was. It is still the eternal conflict between agnosticism and faith, atheism and revelation. It marks the difference between temporal daily despair and spiritual eternal joy by denying or accepting the spiritual truth about Christ, His mission, and His gospel. How do we become a humble seeker of true happiness to deserve spiritual eternal joy?&nbsp;<br /><br />First, true happiness is a result of our will to obey the Lord's commandments, our decisions to live the Lord's way in order to create "eternal happiness or eternal misery, according to the spirit which they listed to obey, whether it be a good spirit or a bad one."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The result of our obedience is also called "never-ending happiness"<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;or "endless life and happiness."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;The pattern of the Lord for the great plan of happiness is very simple: given revelation is always followed by given commandments. Why? So that "every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world; That faith also might increase in the earth."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Let us recognize this pattern in the scriptures. It starts with an observation of the Lord about the people of the world. What is their usual challenge? "They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness." What is their problem? "Every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god." What is the Lord's answer to what He describes as a calamity? First, He called His servant Joseph Smith, Jun., as a prophet. Second, He spake unto him from heaven to give him a revelation. Third, He then gave him commandments.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;So what is the recommendation of the day or the new resolution of the year? Become a "humble seeker of happiness"<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;by learning by faith to obey the commandments of the Lord given to prophets by revelation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second, true happiness is a deliberate choice.&nbsp;<em>Deliberate</em>&nbsp;means characterized by awareness of the consequences. "Wickedness never was happiness." This was the concluding lesson given by Alma to his son Corianton: "Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;One is raised to happiness or sin according to one's desires.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is the same as with faith. It always starts with the desire to believe. Laman and Lemuel, older brothers of Nephi, were murmuring against their father. They were not at all happy with his decisions to leave their home and possessions. Why was it so? "They knew not the dealings of that God who had created them" and "neither did they believe."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;On the contrary, Nephi had great desires to know. He prayed, his heart was softened, he did believe and did not rebel.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Nephi was blessed by the Lord because of his faith and because he sought the Lord with lowliness of heart.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;It is the same with happiness. Become a humble seeker of true happiness by creating the desire to learn by faith and making deliberate choices.&nbsp;<br /><br />Third, true happiness is connected to revelation, the sacred word of God, and to maintain it in our life. Moroni is justifying winning the battle against Zerahemnah, his Lamanite opponent in the battle, saying: "We have gained power over you, by our faith, . . . and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our happiness."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The scriptures contain the sacred word of God that has been preserved by the prophets for our knowledge, sake, and action.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Notice the emphasis given to the word&nbsp;<em>knowledge</em>&nbsp;of the sacred word and the relationship to salvation in the following scripture: "And at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people of the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;To become a humble seeker of true happiness is to learn by faith how to maintain the sacred word of God in our daily life, meaning to keep it in an existing state.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fourth, true happiness is a way of life. "And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness," exclaimed Nephi after his separation from the Lamanites.<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Today, as always, we are exposed to an unprecedented growing trend to tolerate, accept, and then support what was earlier and always considered as evil. This has been the devil's plan to destroy the great plan of happiness since the beginning. Isaiah already gave the following warning: "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!"<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />There always comes a time when separation between seekers of true happiness and seekers of pleasure takes place. Nephi, his family, and his followers received a warning from the Lord to depart from those who would be called Lamanites and flee into the wilderness (see 2 Nephi 5:5). What were the differences between the Lamanites and the Nephites in their way of living? These great lessons are learned from Nephi, the prophet:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord has always given "a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations."<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;To become a humble seeker of true happiness is learning by faith to live after the manner of happiness of the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today I have given you a brief description of what happens when we turn to the Lord to learn by faith how to become a humble seeker of happiness. Here are the four basic elements again:&nbsp;</p>
<p>History and testimonies of the faithful tell us the following about the followers of the great plan of happiness: "And surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God." And why was it so? "Because there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness. Because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people."<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;My sole purpose in this talk is to help you to be truly happy and to give you a true perspective of happiness. In Proverbs we read that "Where there is no vision, the people perish."<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Here are some final suggestions for a vision of happiness:&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, "If ye know these things, [now you do!] happy are ye if ye do them,"<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;or in the words of President Boyd K. Packer: "If you understand the great plan of happiness and follow it, what goes on in the world will not determine your happiness."<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />True happiness begins by believing and learning by faith that whatever you have done or are already doing is nothing with regard to what you can do in the future. Changes are part of your life and your future, and if they are linked with true values and principles of happiness, they will make you succeed and be happy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Regardless of what you do or what you don't have in this life, your deepest, most lasting happiness will come from knowing God's plan of salvation, the great plan of happiness, and following it because of your faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement. King Mosiah, a prophet, put it this way:&nbsp;<br /><br />"I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God.&nbsp; For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness."<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />It is now time to conclude, and the best way is to wish you a very Happy New Year. You still have 319 days left to ponder how to become or remain a humble seeker of true happiness!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>What an inspiring sight it is to look out on this congregation of young people gathered in this newly dedicated building and to share the occasion with Dr. Clark and others of the administration and faculty who are called by modern-day prophets of God to lead this university. I truly never imagined that I might have the opportunity to be invited here to address you, and I pray that the Spirit will speak to you in some meaningful way through the things I have prepared.<br /><br />Incidentally, not long after I was asked to give this devotional talk, my wife, Dixie, and I ran into Elder and Sister Bednar at the Salt Lake Airport. We told them of this assignment, and they became very animated. Elder Bednar said we would have one of the most receptive and intelligent audiences to be found anywhere in the Church. And then he said, "Do I sound like a doting father figure?" It was obvious to us that a large portion of his heart still resides on the campus of this university and with the students who attend school here.&nbsp;<br /><br />A few years ago, we had the opportunity to drive our granddaughter up here to Rexburg to help her get settled as she began her first year at BYU-Idaho. She has since served in the Argentina Rosario Mission and recently was married in the Salt Lake Temple. Her experience here helped to prepare her for these future opportunities and responsibilities. She once said that she watched the walls of the Rexburg Temple go up but was away on her mission when it was dedicated. So many good influences and important associations are accessible to you as you avail yourselves of positive experiences during these preparatory years.&nbsp;<br /><br />Often, we see members of the Church who want to approach their membership "cafeteria style" by picking and choosing this thing or that thing that is appealing to them but not wanting a well-balanced meal that will provide for them the full nutrition needed for a healthy spiritual mind and body. Are we sometimes guilty of being this type of Latter-day Saint? For instance, there are those who try to pick and choose from among the commandments so they can abide by those that appeal to them and ignore others.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our Heavenly Father devised a plan that will ultimately lead us back to Him through the Atonement of his Son, Jesus Christ, if we accept His plan and do our part to live in accordance with the commandments He has set forth. This plan has been called "the plan of salvation," "the plan of happiness," "the Lord's plan for mankind," or "the plan of mercy." These are all the same plan, set forth in the premortal existence and accepted through our agency by each one of us while we were there.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now that we are on this side of the veil, isn't it imperative that we discover why we are here and why all of the commandments are important to us? As Moses led the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt after some four hundred years of bondage, the Lord gave them specific commandments, ordinances, rites, and instructions, many of which might have seemed overly detailed and possibly too difficult for the people of that time to live. As we read in the Bible in the book of Leviticus, we can understand the Lord's motivation for giving such strict laws that governed nearly every aspect of their lives. The Lord wanted His chosen people to leave the Egyptian ways behind. He also knew that they needed to be prepared to enter the promised land without accepting the ways of the inhabitants they would find there. We read in Leviticus, "After the doings of the land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do, and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, ye shall not do; neither shall ye walk in their ordinances. Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein; I am the Lord, your God."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />How does this apply to our lives in this time and dispensation? We, too, have been given prophets who have instructed us through the inspiration of the Lord to walk in His ways. This gospel plan touches virtually every aspect of our lives and encompasses that which we should do both spiritually and physically. In speaking with my son, Mark, he related that as newlyweds, he and his wife realized that their status as students would not permit them the luxury of being a two-car family. Mark, therefore, acquired a bicycle and began riding it to school-both while attending Brigham Young University in Provo but also later as a law student at Columbia University in New York City. He told me that while the bicycle was practical from a financial standpoint, it proved to be a springboard for other things as well, including a love of the benefits of regular physical exercise. He has continued to exercise, and after he moved to Boulder, Colorado, this desire to keep himself in good physical condition morphed into a love of mountain climbing and trail running. A few months ago, he found himself in good enough physical condition to run the Leadville 100, which is a one-hundred-mile run through the mountains of southern Colorado. Needless to say, he discovered added benefits to the obvious ones that he originally planned. Might our choosing to accept and live a principle or commandment that we previously ignored open new vistas and give us an added appreciation, insight, or understanding of the gospel that we didn't have before? In the process, we will be on our way to living the complete gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes we are asked to accept commandments purely on faith, not knowing the why or wherefore. For example, the Lord gave the Prophet Joseph Smith advice some 178 years ago, found today in the 89th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, that members of the Church should not use tobacco or alcohol and should eat grains and cereals, eat fresh fruits in season, and eat meat sparingly, along with other beneficial counsel. That advice has proved to be not only spiritually sound but also medically correct as, over the decades, those who have followed this Word of Wisdom prophecy, as well as those in the medical profession who have recognized its beneficial outcomes, have discovered the many ills that can be attributed to smoking and drinking and not eating properly. In like fashion, the Lord has revealed to modern-day prophets that the illegal use of drugs is extremely addictive and harmful to men and women, as is pornography. Living all aspects of the Word of Wisdom involves living the complete gospel of Jesus Christ.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the other basic commandments of the gospel with which we sometimes have difficulty complying is the law of tithing. This law has always existed and comes with a promise of blessings in return for obedience. My experience has always been that this is true. A couple of years ago, I received a sizable and unexpected check that came to my office in California to my lawyer/assistant, Claudia, of some twenty-eight years. As we discussed what should be done with the money, Claudia looked at me and said, "The first thing you need to do is pay your tithing." Claudia is not a member of the Church, but over the years, she has come to recognize the blessings that Sister Oveson and I have received from consistently paying an honest tithe. We just assume that everything belongs to the Lord in the first place and that asking for us to return a tenth to Him is a pretty good deal. In addition, however, we recognize that living the law of tithing completely is merely one aspect of living the complete gospel of Jesus Christ. And I assure you that living the law of tithing is one commandment you can live perfectly.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />There is a relatively simple way to know how you stand with the Lord and His teachings. That comes by sitting down with your bishop and answering the questions he asks as you receive your temple recommend. At this point, perhaps some of you will say, "I have not been endowed in the temple and therefore don't have a temple recommend." I point out that everyone who is twelve years of age or over and is a baptized member of the Church is eligible to receive a recommend to go to the temple to do baptisms and confirmations. Although these are not all the ordinances available in the temple, they require the same degree of worthiness as for those who are attending the temple to participate in the further ordinances there. While I was serving as a mission president in Argentina, I, along with all the mission presidents throughout the world, received instruction that all missionaries in the world should have a current temple recommend. This counsel may have come as a surprise to some of the mission presidents, as they were located in areas of the world where attending a temple was impossible for their missionaries. But I think the counsel points out how important President Hinckley felt that all missionaries should be worthy of and possess a current temple recommend because it provided evidence of their righteous standing before the Lord.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />In 1964, my wife, Dixie, and I had the privilege of being involved in the conversion of a wonderful young couple while we were living in Santa Maria, California. A little over a year later, we were further privileged to attend the Los Angeles Temple with Dwyane and Susan Collins as they were sealed to each other and to their young son, Dwyane Jr. We remained very close to them over the succeeding years, through good times and through difficult times. When Dwayne Sr. joined the Church, he gave up many things of the world-one of which was jackpot rodeo roping on Sundays, which had been a significant source of income for him, as he was an outstanding cowboy.&nbsp;<br /><br />A few years ago, I sat at Dwyane's bedside shortly before he passed away, as he was terminally ill with cancer. At that time, he expressed to me that the gospel and his family had always been the top priorities of his life. He stated that even through the trials from the loss of two of his three sons, being worthy always to be in the temple was of paramount importance to him. He said, "I always have a current temple recommend with me. It's in my back pocket right now." A short time later as Dixie and I attended his funeral, together with a multitude of others, we stood by his coffin looking down at him when wife Susan said to us, "His temple recommend is still there, at his request, in his pocket." I hope that each of you will always be worthy to carry a temple recommend with you throughout your life. Possessing a current temple recommend is one indication that we are attempting to live the complete gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Christ repeatedly told us to pray always, and I know that this counsel doesn't seem like a difficult thing to do. However, the Prophet Nephi explains very clearly and succinctly why praying can sometimes be so difficult. He said these words: "And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />So for me, when I feel like I really do not want to pray, I remember this scripture and know what is happening to me and recognize that I&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;pray-that whatever I need to pray about must be very important for me and perhaps for others as well. One of the things I most cherished about my deceased 101-year-old mother was that she told me often, "I pray for you every day!" We try to remember this and do the same for our loved ones, praying for them by name each day. I testify that this type of prayer will bring real benefits to your loved ones and help you in living the complete gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />I recognize that it is very easy to get off the track and do things that will bring us unhappiness. King David was certainly one of the most beloved servants of the Lord. He was blessed and anointed from the time he was a youth to become the future king of Israel, God's chosen people. The Lord blessed him as he rallied the people around him and overcame virtually all the enemies of the kingdom of Israel. Things could not have been better for David until, as related in Chapter 11 of 2 Samuel, it was the time of year when kings went forth to battle. However, David elected not to go. Instead, he sent his army with Joab at its head while David tarried at Jerusalem. Thus, David wasn't where he was supposed to be. That's mistake number one.&nbsp;<br /><br />David rose from his bed in the evening and went out onto the roof of his house and there observed on another roof a woman washing herself, as was the custom of the time. And the scripture tells us that the woman was very beautiful to look upon. David should have seen this woman from afar and looked away. Instead, he gazed upon her. Mistake number two. Then, David sent and inquired after the woman; found out who she was; and found that she was Bath-Sheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, one of David's loyal soldiers. Mistake number three. Because David was the king of Israel, he sent messengers to summon Bath-Sheba to him. She came to him and he lay with her. Big mistake number four. Consequently, Bash-Sheba conceived a child. Now, David had a really big problem. He thought he could fix it by bringing Uriah home from the battlefield. David met Uriah and told him to return to his home and wash and spend some time with his wife. But Uriah, being the good soldier he was, recognized that his comrades in arms were sleeping in tents on the battlefield, so he did not want to take advantage of his situation. Therefore, he slept on the ground at the doorstep of David's house. David, of course, could not pass off the child as Uriah's, and he knew that Uriah would find out the truth.&nbsp;<br /><br />So David made his final and biggest mistake-one that will haunt him forever. He sent a letter with Uriah, as Uriah was returning to the battlefield, instructing Joab thusly: "Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten and die."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Subsequently, Uriah did perish, leaving David to wed Bath-Sheba. David's actions made the Lord very unhappy; and, as a consequence, the son born to David and Bath-Sheba was stricken and died. Also, the Lord told David that "the sword shall never depart from thine house."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />How does this story apply to us? David made a series of ill-conceived decisions that inevitably led to his lasting unhappiness, beginning with his failure to be where he was supposed to be and continuing with the breaking of two commandments: coveting his neighbor's wife and committing adultery. Breaking these commandments then led to the shedding of innocent blood. In the process, the many lies and deceptions caused David's ultimate separation from the closeness and favor he had always previously enjoyed with the Lord. By simply choosing to keep the commandments, David could have and would have prevented all the terrible consequences that followed. In a similar fashion, when we choose to keep all the commandments, we are on our way to living the complete gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord has given us laws and commandments that, in reality, make life relatively easy. I'm not saying that life is going to be without its challenges and trials, but if we keep these basic principles, we can be assured that, through the Atonement of our Savior, everything will work out in the long run. What we need to have as our focus in whatever circumstances we face are legitimate answers to the following questions: Will this trial draw us closer to the Lord? Or will it distance us from Him?&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />You should know that at the outset of the invitation to speak here, I questioned my ability to provide meaningful material for students and faculty such as you. I don't consider myself a great scholar or scriptorian, although I have great admiration for academics and gospel scholars. Throughout my life, I have wondered why the opportunities and callings I have enjoyed have come to me. I am truly an ordinary man-one who, at the stage of life you are now in, would never have dreamed of having any of the callings that have become such a significant part of what I now represent. I grew up in small communities, working on farms and raising animals. My parents were faithful members of the Church, my father having served a full-time mission. They didn't live close enough to attend a branch regularly and were, for years, the only members in their entire community. They taught me and my siblings the principles of the gospel in our home by word and by example. Perhaps that is where we learned that the Lord uses ordinary people to do His work and build His kingdom.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I received my patriarchal blessing, I had no idea of the import it would ultimately have in my life. A few words from that blessing have taken on a rich and deep meaning as my life has unfolded: "You will be called upon to lift up your voice in defense of the everlasting gospel and to bear testimony to the people of the world of its divinity and its truthfulness."&nbsp;<br /><br />As a young man, newly called to serve in the Northern Mexican Mission, I felt that this blessing was surely being fulfilled. Of course, being of pure Danish/Scandinavian descent from both my father and mother, I had always desired to serve my mission in Denmark. Little did I know, at that time, that the Lord was preparing me for future callings, many of which were dependent upon my becoming fluent in teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ in the Spanish language. For instance, how many Danish-speaking mission presidents do you think are needed in the Church at any given time compared to the number of Spanish-speaking mission presidents? Our service in the Argentina Buenos Aires South Mission helped me see that this promise in my blessing had a greater far-reaching effect than I had previously imagined. In the October 1999 general conference, as I stood at the pulpit of the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City and addressed the membership of the Church all over the world, as you might suppose, the promise took on even greater significance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Half of the time that I served in the Second Quorum of the Seventy was spent in the Chile area, where Spanish was essential to the members of the area presidency in fulfilling our responsibilities and interacting with the members. Even the call that Sister Oveson and I received in 2005, to serve as president and matron of the newly dedicated Newport Beach Temple, involved using our Spanish-language skills in helping with the temple ordinances for many of the Spanish-speaking members of our temple district.&nbsp;<br /><br />In retrospect, at this time of our lives, during this, my seventy-fifth year and after having recently celebrated our fiftieth wedding anniversary, we can see the hand of the Lord in our lives more clearly when we look back on the ways He prepared us to become worthy instruments in His hands to help build the kingdom in the places He called us to serve.&nbsp;<br /><br />Truly, if there is anything of which I am certain, it is this: The Lord has a plan for each one of us, and, if we are diligent in keeping His commandments and in staying close to Him, He will prepare us in whatever way He knows is necessary to help us reach our potential and become what He wants us to become. Please, my young brothers and sisters, remember to stay firm in the gospel, obedient to all of its principles and commandments, heeding the counsel of our prophets. I specifically and pointedly invite you to live the complete gospel of Jesus Christ rather than live a cafeteria-style life in which you choose to live only those commandments that appeal to you.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In this manner, you will qualify for the many blessings the Lord desires to bestow upon you.&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify that these things are true, that the Church of Jesus Christ has been restored in this dispensation through the Prophet Joseph Smith, that Joseph translated the Book of Mormon through the gift and power of God, and that the Savior of the world accomplished the infinite atonement for our sins and opened the way, through His glorious resurrection, for us to return to the presence of our Father in Heaven. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>My dear young friends, what a delight it is for me to be here with you today. As we entered into Rexburg and onto this beautiful campus, I once again felt the powerful spirit that is resident here. I am a native of Idaho Falls and I worked professionally for almost 30 years in this valley. I had the privilege of serving on this campus as a stake president. This is a choice university. Take advantage of every minute that you have in this sacred place. My father, my mother, my four grandparents and my eight great-grandparents lived in this Upper Snake River Valley. This is a blessed land and truly is the land of my fathers.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed that when God tests his people, as he prepares them to receive greater blessings, that they are tested in the wilderness? Adam and Eve were cast out of the garden into the lone and dreary world to prepare themselves to return to their heavenly home. Moses and the children of Israel went into the wilderness and were tested before they could inherit the Promised Land. Ten of the Tribes of Israel were scattered into the wilderness and lost to the knowledge of man so that God could prepare them for the eventual gathering of Israel.&nbsp;<br /><br />John the Baptist retired to the wilderness to prepare himself for his ministry. Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, went into the wilderness to be tempted and to prepare for his mortal ministry. The Jaredites left their home and went into the wilderness in order to inherit the Promised Land of America. Lehi and Mulek also went into the wilderness as a preparation to inhabit that same Promised Land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In our day the Saints following the Prophet Joseph were driven into the wilderness as they were tested and tried, and then under the prophet Brigham Young they again went into the wilderness to establish Zion in the tops of the mountains.&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to share with you a tale about going into the wilderness, which I believe applies to us today in a very real way.&nbsp;<br /><br />One night in ancient times, three horsemen were riding across a desert.&nbsp; As they crossed the dry bed of a river, out of the darkness a voice called, "halt!" They obeyed. The voice then told them to dismount, to pick up handfuls of pebbles, put the pebbles in their pockets and remount. The voice then said, "If you have done as I commanded, tomorrow at sunup you will be both glad and sorry." The horsemen rode on. When the sun rose, they reached into their pockets and found that a miracle had happened. The pebbles had been transformed into diamonds and other precious stones. They remembered the warning that they would be both glad and sorry.&nbsp; Glad they had taken some; sorry they had not taken more.&nbsp;<br /><br />While in this tale the quantity of pebbles is important, it isn't everything. The quality of the pebbles is also very important. Some pebbles are of more worth than others. My prayer today is to help each of you identify which pebbles are of the greatest worth. I want to talk to you today about who you are.&nbsp;<br /><br />I think of a conversation that Hamlet has with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Shakespeare's Hamlet. A famous line, and I would add, a famous lie that Hamlet utters, is "There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so." That is a lie. Indeed Isaiah said, "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!"<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I know that when we understand who we are, we are empowered to act differently. We rise and act in accordance with the potential that is within us. As we talk today, please bear in mind that the father of all lies - Lucifer, the great deceiver - would have you believe otherwise. He would have you believe that you are descended from early forms of life that somehow crawled out of the sea and evolved into a human being. He would have you believe that you are the product of monkeys evolved into men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If you believe that you are from such a linage, it is easy to justify anything. After all, "I'm not responsible for my acts; that's just the way I am. I'm an animal, it's in my genes." Satan would remove from you any sense of responsibility. He would say things like:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;"And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none-and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Joseph Smith said: "...in the last days, in relation to the kingdom of God, the devil always sets up his kingdom at the very same time in opposition to God."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Satan has a plan for everyone and tries to deceive the learned with their own perceived wisdom:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profited them not. And they shall perish. But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Let me share with you two things that have helped keep me from being deceived: first is my patriarchal blessing, and second is knowing that I am of the seed of Abraham. To avoid being deceived, in addition to fasting, prayer, living prophets and the scriptures, I have found a great protection in my life. It is a personal revelation given to me when I was only 17 years old. It is called my patriarchal blessing.&nbsp;<br /><br />In that blessing I have found the answers to some of my most profound questions. I would like to share with you one example that is personal to me, but that applies to everyone here today. It reads, "There have been many other choices placed before you and you have found it is necessary to always choose that which is in harmony with the teachings of your parents, the teachings of the leaders of the Church, the teachings of the scriptures, because the temptations of the world are so camouflaged and made so enticing that unless you are willing to square with the teachings of the gospel you will be deceived."&nbsp;<br /><br />How can we avoid being deceived? By knowing who we are. I testify that you and I are the seed of Abraham and chosen members of the House of Israel. These two great truths entitle you to be rightful heirs of all that the Father hath: the privilege to return to His presence and become as He is. You are the legitimate heirs of Abraham. What does that mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the third chapter of the book of Abraham, we begin to get a glimpse of just who Abraham is and therefore who we are. We see who he was before he was born on this earth:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers;</p>
<p>Brethren, when you receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, you receive all of the priesthood. There will never come a time when hands are placed on your head and you receive more priesthood - other offices or callings, yes - but never more priesthood. You hold today the same priesthood that Jesus Christ used to create this world and worlds without end. There is a difference between priesthood authority and priesthood power. Priesthood power comes through obedience. I don't believe that it is pleasing to Heavenly Father to have priesthood authority without priesthood power.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Here we see Abraham in the pre-mortal life. We see that he was chosen. What exactly does chosen mean? God is no respecter of persons. He has no favorites. When the scriptures say, "many are called but few are chosen," I believe that "chosen" means obedient. Many are called but few are obedient. What God says to Abraham here is that he was obedient before he was born. He was one of the great and noble ones because of his obedience.&nbsp;<br /><br />Not only do we see our father Abraham but we see ourselves as well. Joseph Smith said, "Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of heaven before this world was. I suppose that I was ordained to this very office in that Grand Council."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />President Ezra Taft Benson said: "Young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, you have been born at this time for a sacred and glorious purpose. It is not by chance that you have been reserved to come to earth in this last dispensation of the fullness of times. Your birth at this particular time was foreordained in the eternities."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Sisters, do you think you are any less? I think not. I testify that all of you were there. I testify that you are part of the great and noble ones that we learn about in Abraham chapter 3, verse 22. Go with me now to Abraham chapter 2, verse 8. We now see Abraham as a mortal being. Who is Abraham? An ancient prophet you say. That is correct. Who else is Abraham? He is the father of many nations. That is also correct. But Abraham is much closer than that to me. He is my grandfather.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me ask you a question. If you had a rich grandfather, would you be happy or sad? Happy? That's right! Because if you had a rich grandfather, you could expect a rich inheritance. I am here today to tell you that Abraham is your grandfather, too. I know that he is my grandfather by reading that personal revelation that God gave me through one of his authorized servants. If you read your patriarchal blessing, you will see that you too are from his linage.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me add here that if you don't have a patriarchal blessing, prepare for it and get it. Father has some amazing things that he wants to share with you. One of the greatest is the knowledge that you are the seed of Abraham. Because of Abraham's obedience in the pre-mortal and this mortal life, God made a covenant with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now as we read in Abraham, it will be much more meaningful because we will be reading about our grandfather and we will realize that all that has been promised to him is also promised to us his seed. Let's read Abraham chapter 2, verses 8 through 11.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"My name is Jehovah, and I know the end from the beginning; therefore my hand shall be over thee.</p>
<p>Here, Jesus Christ the Jehovah of the Old Testament is conversing with Father Abraham. He promises him specific blessings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee above measure, and make thy name great among all nations...</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question. Did you know that Abraham is recognized among all Christian, Jewish, and Muslim nations as their father? Truly his name has been made great among many nations, and as the gospel fills the whole earth his name will be great among all nations. And now, the part that talks specifically about you and me and the mission that we have:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...and thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed [us] after thee, that in their hands [our hands] they [we] shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Why is it so important to Father in Heaven and the Savior to bear this priesthood unto all nations? Because,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God. And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh;"<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Without all of the ordinances of the higher priesthood, which are received in the holy temples of God, we will never return home to Father. And after all, we are His work and his glory. His greatest desire is that we return home to Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />We do missionary work to take the priesthood and temples to the world. Therefore, when President Monson made the renewed call for more missionaries in the October 2010 General Conference, and said...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"First, to young men of the Aaronic Priesthood and to you young men who are becoming elders: I repeat what prophets have long taught-that every worthy, able young man should prepare to serve a mission. Missionary service is a priesthood duty-an obligation the Lord expects of us who have been given so very much. Young men, I admonish you to prepare for service as a missionary. Keep yourselves clean and pure and worthy to represent the Lord. Maintain your health and strength. Study the scriptures. Where such is available, participate in seminary or institute. Familiarize yourself with the missionary handbook&nbsp;<em>Preach My Gospel</em>."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>...President Monson was echoing the words of the Savior uttered thousands of years ago to the prophet, and our father, Abraham:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And I will bless them through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father;&nbsp;"And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and in thee [that is, in thy priesthood] and in thy seed, [that is, thy priesthood] for I give unto thee a promise that this right shall continue in thee, and in thy seed after thee [that is to say, the literal seed, or the seed of the body] shall all the families of the earth be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal."&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what we refer to as the Abrahamic Covenant. There are four specific ways that we are blessed by the covenant that Abraham our grandfather made with God. They are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me make a side note here. First, I have a question. Can I see by a raise of hands, how many of you are from one of the scattered lost ten tribes? Let me ask another question. Who are the two found tribes? They are Judah and Benjamin. If you are from any other tribe besides Judah or Benjamin, like Ephraim or Manasseh, you are from one of the lost ten tribes. I hope I have peaked your interest enough now so you will go and study that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does being the seed of Abraham tie into being members of the House of Israel? Bear in mind that Abraham had a son; his name was Isaac. Isaac had a son; his name was Jacob. Jacob had his name changed by God. The name God gave him was Israel. Israel had 12 sons. They were called the House of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Everyone within the sound of my voice who is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a descendent of Israel either by bloodline or adoption. Thus, the blessings of Abraham passed down through Isaac and on to Jacob and then to his 12 sons.&nbsp;<br /><br />The majority of this audience today comes through Joseph and then through one of his two sons, Ephraim or Manasseh. There will also be a small number of people here from other tribes of Israel. It really doesn't matter which. In the end, if a person magnifies his calling, once you are in the House you are entitled to all the promised blessings or the inheritance. I testify that we are of the House of Israel. Can you see how this knowledge will keep you from being deceived?&nbsp;<br /><br />A second side note: if you want a very interesting study, get a new copy of the Book of Mormon and go through and underline each time you see the words "house of Israel." If you get the same number I did, you will see it over 105 times, beginning on the Title Page and ending in Moroni 10:31. I'm not sure we can completely understand the Book of Mormon if we don't understand the House of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />One more thing to think about as you study the seed of Abraham and the house of Israel: all of the house of Israel is of the seed of Abraham, but not all of the seed of Abraham is of the house of Israel. That is a teaser to make you want to learn more about both.&nbsp;<br /><br />I mentioned that once you are in the house, if you magnify your calling and receive all of the ordinances offered by our Father in Heaven in his holy house, the temple, that you are entitled to all the promised blessings or the inheritance. What is that inheritance? What is promised to the faithful, the obedient seed of Abraham, those of the house of Israel?&nbsp;<br /><br />First, before we go to the place where we find the treasure, the inheritance, that which we have been seeking for, let me say a word about the priesthood that we have been foreordained to carry to the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We cannot talk about priesthood without talking about the sisters of the Church. The Plan of Happiness, the blessing of eternal life, the life that God lives, the privilege of being in his presence and being like Him, that which we call eternal life requires two things: a worthy priesthood bearer who magnifies his calling and a worthy woman who magnifies her calling.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;&nbsp;"And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];&nbsp;"And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.&nbsp;"He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Now as we read together the Oath and Covenant of the Holy Priesthood, we will understand what the reward of faithfulness is to those who are covenants keepers. We will also see the penalty for those who are covenant breakers:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.&nbsp;"They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron</p>
<p>You remember that it was Moses who led the house of Israel out of bondage from Egypt and took them to the Promised Land. It was the Law of Moses with the Levitical Priesthood, or the priesthood of Aaron that became the schoolmaster to guide the rebellious Israelites to the higher law or the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God, which was taken from them because of disobedience. Christ would restore this priesthood when he entered into mortality in the meridian of time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.</p>
<p>It was through Abraham that God covenanted that the priesthood would come down through his line and that through that priesthood all of the nations of the world would be blessed. We are that seed and through obedience we become the church and kingdom and the elect of God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;&nbsp;"And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.&nbsp;"And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.&nbsp;"Therefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved.</p>
<p>This is the promised inheritance: all that the Father hath, the ability to be like Him. We next see the consequences of turning away from the sacred covenants that we have made with God.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But whoso breaketh this covenant after he hath received it, and altogether turneth there from, shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And wo unto all those who come not unto this priesthood which ye have received, which I now confirm upon you who are present this day, by mine own voice out of the heavens; and even I have given the heavenly hosts and mine angels charge concerning you.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>God has allowed us, through His love and grace, to enter into sacred covenants with Him, the Abrahamic Covenant, which includes the baptismal, priesthood, and temple covenants is necessary for exaltation. This covenant and these blessings flow today through the house of Israel.&nbsp;<br /><br />Through making and keeping sacred covenants, God allows us to receive all that He has and to return to live with Him and live the life that He lives. All that He has shall be given unto us, if we keep the covenants that we have entered into.&nbsp;<br /><br />Without the infinite atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, none of us would be able to return to the Father because of our sins. "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you understand who you are? We are the seed of Abraham. We are the house of Israel. We are the covenant people of God, and because we know who we are, we must act accordingly. There are places we can never go. There are Web pages we can never enter. There are thoughts that we can never entertain. There are impure practices that we can never be part of, because those things are not worthy of who we are.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me end by returning to where we began. Remember the voice said that in the morning they would be both glad and sorry? Our lives are like this tale. As we leave our heavenly home to come to this wilderness, this desert if you will, Father did not leave us on our own. He prepared everything that we need to return back to our eternal home.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes as we move through our journey here below we underestimate the value of the precious pebbles that He places in our paths. Sometimes we esteem them as pebbles of little or no worth. He provides us with the ability through fasting, study, and prayer to know which the most valuable pebbles are.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />He has placed living prophets on the earth to guide us. He has given us the words of the earlier prophets in the scriptures to lead us through the night. He has given us his Only Begotten Son to pay the price that we can't pay, to atone for what we can't atone. He has provided the Plan of Happiness that returns us home safe and sound and with the knowledge and covenants that allow us to become like him. He has told us who we are.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes these pebbles seem small and insignificant. When He says fill your pockets, we sometimes hear another voice saying, "Don't worry. They are only pebbles. They will slow you down. They will be heavy and cumbersome to carry. It's just not worth the hassle. Besides if they are that important, your friends will have some extras."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Often we are so focused on the journey that we don't see the destination. We half-heartedly follow the direction that is given us and wander in strange paths that promise excitement and thrills, but that always end up hollow and cheap.&nbsp;<br /><br />My dear young brothers and sisters, now is the time to prepare to meet God. Now is the time to act according to the knowledge that God has given us.&nbsp; Suddenly we realize how short life is, and with Jacob, we realize "...that the time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, ... in a wilderness..."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />But because of the goodness of God, the important things "...are made known unto us in plain terms, that we may understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being wanderers in a strange land; therefore, we are thus highly favored, for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />"Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree of Israel, and has been lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my God, who has been mindful of us, wanderers in a strange land."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />"And now my [brothers and sisters], behold I have somewhat more to desire of you, which desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven, yea, which is eternal, and which fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of eternal life, which we have reason to suppose hath been given to our fathers."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />"Wherefore, my beloved [brothers and sisters], pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As we wander in this wilderness below, the pebbles that we have gathered will be transformed and on that glorious, light filled morning when we see Him again, the precious gems that we posses will give us rightful entry into His presence, and we will be home. That we may be wise enough and diligent enough to understand, and apply all that the Father has prepared for us, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emeritus General Authority</p>
<p><strong>John Max Madsen</strong>&nbsp;(born April 24, 1939) is a General Authority&nbsp;of&nbsp;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has been a General Authority since 1992.<br /><br />Madsen had planned to go to dental school but instead became a&nbsp;seminary&nbsp;teacher and spent much of his career with the&nbsp;Church Educational System&nbsp;(CES). In 1968, Madsen was sent to England as the first seminary teacher to work there. &nbsp;For a time, Madsen served as a CES coordinator in England.&nbsp;He also served as an&nbsp;institute&nbsp;instructor and later as a religion professor at&nbsp;Brigham Young University. Madsen got both his&nbsp;master's&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ed.D.&nbsp;from BYU. Madsen was later an LDS Church employee, serving in the&nbsp;Melchizedek Priesthood&nbsp;Department and other administrative roles. He was among the contributors to the 1992&nbsp;Encyclopedia of Mormonism.<sup id="cite_ref-3"></sup><br /><br />Prior to his call as a General Authority, Madsen served in the LDS Church as a&nbsp;regional representative&nbsp;and as&nbsp;president&nbsp;of the England Southwest Mission (1970 to 1973).&nbsp;He also served as a member of the Young Men General Board and as a stake mission president.&nbsp;In 1992, Madsen became a member of the&nbsp;Second Quorum of the Seventy. In 1997 he was transferred to the&nbsp;First Quorum of the Seventy.<br /><br />As a General Authority, Madsen's assignments included serving as president of the church's&nbsp;Mexico&nbsp;North&nbsp;Area, and in the presidency of the North America West, North America Northwest, Philippines, and Australia/New Zealand areas. &nbsp;He also served in the general presidency of the church's&nbsp;Young Men organization,&nbsp;having also served as a member of the organization's general board earlier in his life.<sup id="cite_ref-8"></sup><br /><br />Madsen was designated as an&nbsp;emeritus&nbsp;general authority at the church's October 2009&nbsp;General Conference.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Madsen#cite_note-9"><br /></a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is a sacred privilege for Sister Madsen and me to join with you for a devotional on this beautiful campus, crowned with a holy temple, and to be in this magnificent hall, so recently dedicated to the Lord for His purposes. Especially, in light of His words recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 6:32, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said unto my disciples, where two or three are gathered together in my name, ... &nbsp;behold, there will I be in the midst of them-even so am I in the midst of you."</p>
<p>I am humbled and honored to be invited to address you, because I know something of who you are and what lies ahead of you! I know this through the words of living prophets. President Joseph Fielding Smith said, "Our young people are ... the nobility of heaven, a choice and chosen generation who have a divine destiny."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />President Spencer W. Kimball said, "We are rearing a royal generation ... who have special things to do."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;And President Gordon B. Hinckley said, "I think we have never had a better generation than this."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;"Upon your shoulders, my dear young friends, will rest the future of the Church."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />My beloved young brothers and sisters, we have all had, or will have, "defining moments" in our lives! Moments that change our lives, and our priorities, forever! Moments that help us to see the importance and power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ!&nbsp;<br /><br />One such moment came right after the funeral of our infant son. My wife and I were riding in the hearse with his tiny white casket before us, and with loved ones and friends following behind. Suddenly, we were overwhelmed with deep and inexpressible feelings of love for our son! And we were filled with a determination to live the gospel of Jesus Christ, in such a way, as to be worthy of a glorious reunion with him, on the morning of the resurrection!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation,"<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;and it is only through the gospel of Jesus Christ that glorious reunions and eternal family relationships are made possible!&nbsp;<br /><br />Some years later, while presiding over the England Southwest Mission, Sister Madsen and I were invited to attend the historic first British Area General Conference, held in Manchester, England, in August of 1971. During the opening session, President Joseph Fielding Smith declared: "The gospel is the sole hope of the world, the one way that will bring peace on earth and right the wrongs that exist in all nations."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;This was another one of those "defining moments" that helped me to see and understand the profound importance and power of the gospel of Jesus Christ!&nbsp;<br /><br />President Hugh B Brown, when speaking to a large gathering of missionaries, asked the following questions: "How many of you know the gospel is true?" Instantly every hand went up! Then he asked, "How many of you know the gospel?" No one moved. There was a profound silence in response to a profound question!&nbsp;<br /><br />We frequently hear and use the word "gospel," but what is the gospel? To be brief and to the point, please complete, in your minds, the following phrase: "The Atonement is not part of the gospel..." Now, I will repeat and complete this phrase. "The Atonement is not part of the gospel, the atonement is the gospel."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The following scriptural references illustrate this point. We turn first to the Doctrine and Covenants 76:40-42:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And this is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us-&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That through him all might be saved..."</p>
<p>What then is the gospel? The gospel, or "good news," as declared by the heavenly voice, is that Jesus Christ came into the world to atone for the sins of the world! Therefore, as used in this context, we can see and say, that the Atonement is not part of the gospel; "the atonement is the gospel."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Next we turn to 1 Corinthians 15:1, 3-4:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how (and here is the Gospel as declared by the Apostle Paul) that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures."</p>
<p>So once again, as used in this context, we can see and say that the Atonement is not part of the gospel, "the atonement is the gospel."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />And in 3 Nephi 27:13-14, we read these words, spoken by the resurrected Lord:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you-that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross..."</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith declared: "The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the apostles and prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that he died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Bruce R. McConkie explained it this way: "We view the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ as the center and core and heart of revealed religion."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;So, if we visualize, in our minds eye, the Atonement of Jesus Christ as the center and core and heart of our religion, then, the all-important question for each of us, and for all mankind, is, how do we lay hold upon the blessings of the Atonement?&nbsp;<br /><br />As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we know how to lay hold upon the blessings of the Atonement! These requirements are clearly set forth in the third and fourth Articles of Faith!&nbsp;<br /><br />But before undertaking a brief discussion of the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel, I wish to remind us of what President Gordon B. Hinckley said about the gospel: "To me the gospel is not a great mass of theological jargon. It is a simple and beautiful and logical thing, with one quiet truth following another in orderly sequence."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />What then, is the first principle of the gospel? We typically answer, faith! But, to emphasize a point, let me say that the first principle of the gospel is not simply, faith.&nbsp; Faith is defined as "confidence in something or someone."&nbsp;<br /><br />The first principle of the gospel is "Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ" who "is the Savior, whose atoning sacrifice opens the door for us to be forgiven of our personal sins so that we can be cleansed to return to the presence of God our Eternal Father. This is the central message of the prophets of all ages." So declared or "affirmed" Elder Dallin H. Oaks, to the faculty and students of Harvard Law School, in February 2010.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The second principle of the gospel is repentance. In Doctrine and Covenants 58:42-43, we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins---behold, he will confess them and forsake them."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>What does it mean to forsake our sins?&nbsp; The word "forsake" means "to renounce," &nbsp;"to quit," or to turn away from and "leave entirely."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;As we apply these concepts to our understanding of repentance, we can see that as we forsake our sins, we are spiritually and figuratively turning away from, not only our sins, but away from him who is the "master" and "the author of all sin."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;We are turning away from him, who seeks "the misery of all mankind,"<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;and him who is continually seeking to "captivate" and "bring [us] down," that he may "reign over" us.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />What then is repentance? Repentance is not only turning away from sin and Satan; repentance is turning and coming unto Christ.<sup>18<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2011_03_08_Madsen.htm#_edn19" target="_self"></a></sup>True repentance is not only coming unto Christ, it is becoming like Him.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, we come to the third principle of the gospel, which is baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. Yes, baptism "is an essential principle of the gospel."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;But baptism is also an ordinance. I wish to emphasize that ordinances are sacred "acts" that have symbolic and "spiritual meanings."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In Romans 6:3-4, the Apostle Paul teaches us of the symbolic significance of the ordinance of baptism:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>Baptism, among other things, symbolizes the death, burial, and resurrection, or the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Through our baptism we proclaim our faith in and our acceptance of the Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement.&nbsp;<br /><br />The fourth principle of the gospel is "Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost." Who can possibly overstate the supernal blessing and importance of the gift of the Holy Ghost in our lives? We all understand the reality of physical death, which is the "separation of the body and the spirit."<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Spiritual death is "separation from God and His influences,"<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;including the influence of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If we are to lay hold upon the blessings of the Atonement, we must live, as we covenant to do each time we partake of the Sacrament, that we "may always have His Spirit to be with [us]."<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Thus far, we have touched upon the first principles and ordinance of the gospel. And we have seen that the word "gospel" as used in some scriptural passages, refers clearly and specifically to the Atonement of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />But, before proceeding further, we need to understand that the Lord uses the word gospel, to refer not only to the Atonement, but also to the principles and ordinances of the gospel. For example in Doctrine and Covenants 39:5-6, we read:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth my gospel receiveth me; and he that receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And this is my gospel---repentance and baptism by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showeth all things, and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom."<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>The Lord uses the word "gospel" to refer to the principles and ordinances that make it possible for us to lay hold upon the blessings of His Atonement! And the word "gospel," as used in this context, has reference to "mine everlasting covenant," or "the fulness of the gospel," as we see in Doctrine and Covenants 66:2:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Verily I say unto you, blessed are you for receiving mine everlasting covenant, even the fulness of my gospel, sent forth unto the children of men, that they might have life and be made partakers of the glories which are to be revealed in the last days..."<sup>28</sup></p>
<p>In the broadest sense, the word gospel, refers to the entire plan of salvation,<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;as indicated in the following: "The gospel is 'God's plan of salvation, made possible by the atonement of Jesus Christ,' ... and 'includes [all] the eternal truths or laws, covenants and ordinances needed for mankind to enter back into the presence of God.'"<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So, what else is required to enter back into the presence of God? We answer: "We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel."<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />President Howard W. Hunter declared: "All our efforts in proclaiming the gospel, perfecting the Saints, and redeeming the dead, lead to the holy temple. This is because the temple ordinances are absolutely crucial; we cannot return to God's presence without them."<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Thus, in order for us to lay hold upon the crowning blessings of the Atonement, we must qualify for the purifying and exalting ordinances of the holy temple!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Three words are used in connection with, and help us better understand, the Atonement. The first word is reconcile, which means "to bring back into harmony, or agreement, those who have been estranged," or separated.<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;How can we, or all mankind, be reconciled to God?&nbsp; We answer, through Jesus Christ and His Atonement!<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;He is our Mediator, our Intercessor, and our Advocate! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The next word is redeem, which means "to rescue and deliver from bondage;" it means "to obtain or purchase;" it means "to save."<sup>35</sup>How can we, or all mankind, be redeemed from the Fall,<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;from sin,<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;and "from death and hell and the devil"?<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;We answer, through Jesus Christ and His Atonement! He is our Redeemer, our Deliverer, and our Savior!&nbsp;<br /><br />The next word is ransom, which means, "the price" which is paid to "rescue" or "deliver from captivity, bondage, or punishment."<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;How were we, and all mankind, ransomed?&nbsp; We answer, through Jesus Christ and His Atonement!<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />But what was the price He paid? We answer, with the words of the familiar hymn, "I Stand All Amazed": "I tremble to know that for me He was crucified, That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled, and died."<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />These three words, "suffered, bled, and died," summarize the price He paid to ransom us. But before we consider each of the elements of Christ's infinite Atonement, I wish to repeat this line of the hymn, one more time: "I tremble to know that for me he was crucified, That for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died."&nbsp;<br /><br />The Atonement of Jesus Christ "is not a great mass of theological jargon." The Atonement of Jesus Christ was for you and for me-not just for "all mankind." The Atonement of Jesus Christ must be understood, and applied personally! It was for you and for me that He was "stricken, smitten," "afflicted," "wounded," and "bruised."<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;It was for you and for me that He "suffered, bled, and died."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Atonement of Jesus Christ consists of these fundamental elements: First, His suffering. In Doctrine and Covenants 19:16-19, we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit---and would that I might not drink the bitter cup and shrink-&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men."<sup>43</sup></p>
<p>During our Savior's indescribable and incomprehensible suffering, His precious blood was shed. And, regarding the shedding of blood, in Mosiah 3:11 and 18, we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...his blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression of Adam..."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent."</p>
<p>And the Apostle Peter declared that redemption is through the "precious blood of Christ, ...who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world..."<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Having "finished [His] preparations unto the children of men," Luke records, "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />And regarding His death, Isaiah foresaw and said: "He was taken from prison and from judgment:&nbsp; and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: ...he hath poured out his soul unto death..."<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The gospel, as proclaimed by the Apostle Paul, was that "Christ died for our sins...and that he was buried..." just as Old Testament prophets had prophesied! But there was more. Paul also testified that Christ "rose again the third day," as had been prophesied! Therefore, the fourth and final element of the Atonement is, the Resurrection.<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />President Gordon B. Hinckley declared: "The resurrection of Jesus Christ was the great crowning event of His life and mission. It was the capstone of the Atonement. The sacrifice of His life for all mankind was not complete without His coming forth from the grave, with the certainty of the resurrection for all who have walked the earth."<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I was present in a gathering of the Saints where Elder Bruce R. McConkie preached a powerful doctrinal discourse. As he concluded, he asked the following question: "How do you prove that Jesus is the Christ?" There was a complete silence. Then, he declared,"It all centers in the resurrection!" Then he asked, "How do you prove the resurrection?" Once again there was a profound silence. He then declared, "It all centers in witnesses!" There, standing before us, was an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, a special witness.<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Of our living Apostles, President Gordon B. Hinckley said: "In our day the Lord has called 15 special witnesses to testify of His divinity before all the world. Theirs is a unique calling; they are Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, chosen and commissioned by Him. They have been commanded to bear witness of His living reality by the power and authority of the holy apostleship in them vested."<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I know and bear witness that Jesus is the living Christ, the Son of the living God! I know and bear witness that He atoned for the sins of all mankind! And I know that through the Atonement of Christ, we and all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, including the ordinances of the Holy Temple, which make it possible for us, not only to enjoy glorious reunions with those who have gone before, but to live forever as families in the presence of God! All of which I humbly testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is an amazing feeling looking at you as a congregation gathered in this wonderful new auditorium. I believe it is important that we have these opportunities to gather and to be strengthened by the Spirit and by each other. That is one of the reasons why this facility was built.</p>
<p>During the design and construction of this beautiful facility, I had the joy of working with and getting to know many of the individuals who helped design and construct this facility. I can testify that the hand of the Lord was in the details of this place and that miracles were experienced throughout the design and construction.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am also very aware of the number of people it takes to maintain and operate this facility and this campus. All of these individuals are amazing and talented. I express my gratitude to them and to the service they render.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would be lying if I said that I was excited for this opportunity to speak today. My preference would be to sit down with each of you, individually, and to have a one-on-one conversation and during that conversation take opportunity to share with you my testimony that we are children of a loving Heavenly Father, that He knows each of us personally, that Jesus Christ is truly our Savior and Redeemer, and that you and I have great potential despite all of our challenges and weaknesses. His grace truly is sufficient if we come unto Him and follow Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />Preparing for something such as speaking at devotional has given me the opportunity to study and ponder on principles of the gospel that I need and want to understand more &nbsp;in my own life. So in a very selfish sense, I am grateful for this opportunity to learn and to grow in my understanding and application of the gospel. It is my prayer that what I have prepared is as beneficial to you as it has been to me.&nbsp;<br /><br />May I share a personal experience with you?&nbsp;<br /><br />At a previous institution where I was employed, I had been given the responsibility to meet with a group who was preparing to sue the institution and felt very strongly about what had been done and how it had impacted them. I admit that in the first meeting I handled it very poorly. The tone became accusatory, personal, and quite ugly. I found myself reacting to their anger and frustration in a very inappropriate way. The meeting did not go well, and it would be necessary to meet again.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I prepared myself for the next meeting, I found myself preparing for war. I thought of everything that might be thrown at me, and I was preparing myself with all the things I could say or do to show them that they were wrong and the institution I worked for was right.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I was shaving and looking in the mirror that morning and thinking of all that I could do to show them, it came to me, "Charles, choose to pre-forgive. Choose to not be offended." That is what I did. The meeting started out as the first had. I waited patiently until they were done. They had been mean, personal, and offensive. I chose to not be offended, and I listened. It was very hard. When they were done, I simply asked how we could get to a solution to their concerns and frustrations. Once they realized that I was serious about wanting to work with them and come to a resolution, the tone of the meeting changed, apologies were given, and a solution was found that resolved the dispute between the institution and this group at much less cost than going through a lawsuit. The group's leader and I became friends, and I was able to call upon him for future help at the institution. It was a great learning experience for me.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus was asked on one occasion:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul and with all thy mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"This is the first and great commandment.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>These two commandments are inseparable. It is impossible to fulfill the first without fulfilling the second. We cannot love our Father in Heaven without loving our fellow men and loving our neighbor. A most important quality in love is forgiveness. If we truly love our neighbor, we will always be willing and ready to forgive.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jesus Christ placed great importance on forgiveness. Teaching the multitude, He gave what is known as the Lord's Prayer, in which He said: "And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."<sup>2</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Then he added: "For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Again the Lord said: "Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged...."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In his epistle to the Ephesians, the Apostle Paul taught: "Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."5&nbsp;<br /><br />When the adulteress was brought before Christ to be stoned according to the law, He said: "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;They all slipped away, leaving the woman alone with Jesus. With no accusers left, Jesus said: "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Thus, giving the woman the opportunity to repent and be forgiven.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, in agony on the cross, showing the supreme example of forgiveness, He cried out to his Father in Heaven: "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do...."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Can we be as forgiving and as kind as these verses teach us to be?&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to make it clear that forgiveness does not require us to accept or tolerate evil. It does not require us to ignore the wrong that we see in the world around us or in our own lives. But as we battle against sin, we must not allow fear, hatred, or anger control our thoughts or actions.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we have been treated unfairly we should not hate the person who treated us poorly, but we should take appropriate steps to remedy the wrong. If we have been abused, we should not seek revenge, but we should also take steps to prevent further abuse. We must forgive another who injures us, then work constructively to prevent injury from being repeated.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was serving as a bishop I was privileged to meet and get to know a wonderful young woman in our ward. Despite abuse and hurt from those who should have provided for her and loved her, she had a remarkable love for others and a strength beyond her own. I asked her how she was able to do it, despite all the terrible things she had been through. She simply stated, "He is there. He is real and it is through Him that I can find the strength and the love to move on."&nbsp;<br /><br />Forgiveness is not easy. When someone has hurt us or those we care about, that pain can be almost overwhelming. It can feel as if the pain or the injustice is the most important thing in the world and that we have no choice but to seek vengeance. Forgiveness is not instantaneous. It comes more readily when we have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and trust His word. Such faith and trust enables us to see others as our brothers and sisters even in the worst of times and to look beyond ourselves and our own feelings of hurt or anger.&nbsp;<br /><br />Christ, the Prince of Peace, teaches us a better way. It can be very difficult to forgive someone the harm they've done us, but when we do, we open ourselves up to a better future. No longer does someone else's wrong doing control our course. When we forgive others, it frees us to choose how we will live our own lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most vital qualities of the principle of repentance is forgiveness. Unless each of us can learn to forgive others for real or imagined trespasses against us, we cannot properly repent. Lillian Watson has recorded an interesting episode from the ministry of Phillips Brooks, a great American clergyman, as he addressed his affluent, well-dressed congregation on a Sunday morning in Boston over 100 years ago:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"He looked into the faces of men and women he long had known, men and women who had come to him with their problems, who had asked for his help and guidance. How well he knew what seethed behind the pleasant, smiling mask of their Sunday-best respectability! How well he knew the petty spites that embittered their hearts, the animosities that set neighbor against neighbor, the silly quarrels that were kept alive, the jealousies and misunderstandings, the stubborn pride!&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Today his message was for those bitter, unbending ones who refused to forgive and forget. He must make them realize that life is too short to nurse grievances, to harbor grudges and resentments. He would plead for tolerance and understanding, for sympathy and kindness. He would plead for brotherly love.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"'Oh, my dear friends!' he said, . . . and it was as though he spoke to each separately and alone: 'You who are letting miserable misunderstandings run on from year to year, meaning to clear them up some day; You who are keeping wretched quarrels alive because you cannot quite make up your mind that now is the day to sacrifice your pride;"You who are passing men sullenly upon the street, not speaking to them out of some silly spite, and yet knowing that it would fill you with shame and remorse if you heard that one of those men were dead tomorrow morning;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"You who are letting your friends heart ache for a word of appreciation or sympathy, which you mean to give him someday;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If you only could know and see and feel, all of a sudden, that the time is short, how it would break the spell! How you would go instantly and do the thing which you might never have another chance to do.'&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As the congregation poured out of church that Sunday morning, people who hadn't spoken in years suddenly smiled and greeted each other . . . and discovered it was what they had been wanting to do all along. Neighbors who had disliked and avoided each other walked home together . . . and were astonished to find how very much they enjoyed doing it. Many who had been grudging and unkind firmly resolved to be more generous in the future, more considerate of others . . . and all at once felt happier and more content, felt at peace with themselves and the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"'Forgive,' Phillips Brooks urged his congregation. 'Forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. Be patient and understanding. Life is too short to be vengeful or malicious. Life is too short to be petty or unkind.'"&nbsp;</p>
<p>So spoke Philip Brooks over one hundred years ago, that great humanitarian who, incidentally, composed the words to that favorite Christmas hymn, "O Little Town of Bethlehem." Learning to forgive is of great worth in this day as well. Forgiveness is a prime ingredient of love. It is a function of love.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we truly love others then we have no choice but to believe, trust, accept, and hope that our love will be returned. But there can never be any assurance, never any guarantee. If we wait to love only until we are certain of receiving equal love in return, we may wait forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Someone once said, Just because the message may never be received, does not mean it is not worth sending. We love and forgive others because we want to, because it gives us joy. Because we know that growth and discovery of oneself depends upon it.&nbsp;<br /><br />H. Burke Peterson said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Forgiveness of others for wrongs-imaginary or real-often does more for the forgiver than for the forgiven. That person who has not forgiven a wrong or an injury has not yet tasted of one of the sublime enjoyments of life. The human soul seldom reaches such heights of strength or nobility as when it removes all resentments and forgives error or malice. No one can be classed as a true follower of the Savior who is not in the process of removing from his heart and mind every feeling of ill will, bitterness, hatred, envy, or jealousy toward another."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Elder Marvin J. Ashton said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Perhaps the greatest charity comes when we are kind to each other, when we don't judge or categorize someone else, when we simply give each other the benefit of the doubt or remain quiet. Charity is accepting someone's differences, weaknesses, and shortcomings; having patience with someone who has let us down; or resisting the impulse to become offended when someone doesn't handle something the way we might have hoped. Charity is refusing to take advantage of another's weakness and being willing to forgive someone who has hurt us. Charity is expecting the best of each other."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To forgive a person once or twice may not be too difficult, but to continue to forgive many times when one has been wronged may become a real test of character.&nbsp;<br /><br />On one occasion when Jesus was teaching his disciples, Peter approached him and posed this question:&nbsp;"Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />By this declaration we may know that the Savior meant that we should forgive without number or limit.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord has always looked upon sin with disfavor and has exclaimed: "For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance..." Then he continues: "Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven..."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />While the Lord dislikes sin, He always displays a spirit of love and kindness for the sinner. True forgiveness cannot be partial nor halfhearted. It must be wholehearted, genuine, and without reservation. One has said, "The narrow soul knows not the godlike glory of forgiving!"&nbsp;<br /><br />At times we forget that the benefit of forgiving extends both ways. It is as beneficial to forgive as to be forgiven. This is not a formula, but a spirit which can bring out the best in people and illuminate every moment of living. It is one of the happy paradoxes of human behavior that the more willing we are to forgive, the less we are called on to forgive.&nbsp;<br /><br />Forgiveness does not undo what has already been done. It enables us to accept what has been done and go on from there.&nbsp;<br /><br />As the Lord forgives us, as others forgive us, and as we forgive ourselves and others of past mistakes, we gain the freedom to learn from experience; but forgiving our shortcomings does not mean denying they exist. On the contrary, it means facing them honestly, realistically. Forgiving brings a peace of mind, a pleasant assuredness, and freedom. Unless we forgive, we cannot truly love.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth, Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail-&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>I suppose people will always have opposing views, and I suppose there will always be conflict and even misunderstandings. But the principle of mutual respect, mixed with charity and forgiveness, can lay a foundation for the resolving of differences and the solving of problems.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Robert D. Hales stated:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Some people mistakenly think responses such as silence, meekness, forgiveness, and bearing humble testimony are passive and weak. But to "love [our] enemies, bless them that curse [us], do good to them that hate [us], and pray for them which despitefully use [us] and persecute [us]" (Matthew 5:44) takes faith, strength, and, most of all, Christian courage. When we do not retaliate-when we turn the other cheek and resist feelings of anger-we too stand with the Savior. We show forth His love, which is the only power that can subdue the adversary and answer our accusers without accusing them in return. That is not weakness.&nbsp;<em>That</em>&nbsp;is Christian courage."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>There is another important part of forgiveness. Recently, I was in a private conversation with one who, having committed a serious transgression, had also made intense effort to repent and receive forgiveness from those personally offended, including the Lord. When I asked, "Do you feel forgiven by your Heavenly Father?" he answered very hesitantly but with a qualified response. I asked him, "How do we obtain divine forgiveness?"&nbsp;<br /><br />He spoke of the steps he had taken in his life to get to this point. He had forsaken his sins of the past, he had confessed, and had attempted to make restitution to those offended and hurt. He described his efforts to live according to the gospel principles and Church standards.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior and His atoning sacrifice were not mentioned.&nbsp;<br /><br />Despite all of his best efforts in following the steps of repentance, there still appeared to be a burden of remorse and regret for his past sins and a feeling that he must continue to pay for his sins. This is not an isolated case. I believe others are burdened by past mistakes, large and small, because they lack a more perfect understanding of our Father's plan of redemption and mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If we assume that we must pay the price for our sins and thereby earn divine forgiveness, we will not feel free to progress towards our divine potential. The fact is we cannot save ourselves.&nbsp;<br /><br />We can learn from Enos, the Book of Mormon prophet, and his experience while alone in the forest remembering the words taught by his father concerning eternal life:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; . . . And there came a voice unto me, saying, Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee. . .Wherefore, my guilt was swept away. And I said, Lord: how is it done? And he said unto me; Because of thy faith in Christ."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>Father Lehi taught his son Jacob:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit...."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>The resurrected Christ has said, "For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent..."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;To the Nephites he declared, "Return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord's gift of forgiveness is not complete until it is accepted by us. True and complete repentance is a process by which we may become reconciled with God and accept the divine gift of forgiveness. Essential to receiving divine forgiveness is personal, individual recognition and acceptance of our Father's mercy, made available to us by the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ and a renewed covenant to obey the principles of the gospel.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we have completed the steps of repentance and have relied upon the grace and mercy of God, it will be completely natural for us to testify of the Savior and His atoning sacrifice and to strive to be more like Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />The great Atonement was the supreme act of forgiveness. The magnitude of that Atonement is beyond my ability to completely understand. I know only that it did happen and it was for me and it was for you.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is through Christ that we gain forgiveness and the ability to forgive. It is through Christ that there comes a promise that all will be granted the blessings of salvation, with resurrection from the dead. It is through Christ and His great atoning sacrifice that we are offered the opportunity, through obedience, of exaltation and eternal life.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is my prayer that we may be a little more kind and forgiving and that we may seek for forgiveness through Christ. For as we forgive, we achieve the right to be forgiven. As we forgive, we increase our capacity for light and understanding. As we forgive, we live beyond the power of the adversary. As we forgive, our capacity for love expands toward heaven and to all of Heavenly Father's children.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moroni stated it best when he said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure."<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>That we may be a little more like Him is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon, my brothers and sisters. I'm so humbled and excited to be here with you. Thanks for braving another winter blizzard to come to devotional. Oh wait, it's actually spring, isn't it? Well, welcome to another spring day in Rexburg! Even if the weather is a little harsh, aren't you grateful you are here learning and growing.</p>
<p>In preparing for my talk today, I've thought back to when I was a student at Ricks College. I came to this campus as a shy, 18-year-old freshman. I had been on two dates in my life, and I think my mom had asked both girls for me! I got excited for education here at BYU-Idaho. My instructors took an interest in me. They learned my name. I had always wanted to serve a mission because I had wonderful parents who trained me well, but the doctrines of the gospel really came alive for me here. I even got up the courage to ask a few girls on a date. I love BYU-Idaho! This place blessed my life! I pray that the Lord's blessings will be upon us today as I share an important message with you.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today I'd like to draw some lessons from the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith when he was about your age. You might think that because he was such a great and noble spirit, he didn't get a lot of temptations. But he did get a lot of temptations, even though he was engaging in a great and noble work. Maybe I should say that he got a lot of temptations precisely&nbsp;<em>because</em>&nbsp;he was engaged in a great and noble work. That shouldn't surprise us. The adversary seems most interested in distracting and derailing the very people who can do the most good in building the Lord's kingdom.&nbsp;<br /><br />That's why Joseph's example is so relevant for you. You, too, are valiant souls preparing to do a great work. The Lord needs you. He wants to bless many, many people through you. So, like Joseph, you are a target of Satan's most dangerous darts. If you are to be true to your mission, like Joseph, you will need to learn to have an eye single to the glory of God.&nbsp;<br /><br />When Joseph Smith was nearly 18 years old, he wanted to know his standing before the Lord and to repent of his weaknesses. As he prayed, he was visited by the angel Moroni. Moroni told him that God had an important work for him, and then he told him of gold plates buried in a hill not far from his home. The next day, Joseph went to the spot, unearthed the stone box, and reached in to grab the plates. Oliver Cowdery wrote in an early Church publication that, as Joseph did so, he immediately received a shock from an unseen source that stunned his whole body. Eager to retrieve the treasure, he tried again and received another shock. Finally, thinking he just needed to exert more physical strength, he lunged for the plates only to receive the strongest shock yet. With anguish he cried out, "Why can't I obtain this book?"<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In a moment, Moroni was by his side and said, "Because [Joseph] you have not kept the commandments of the Lord."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For this great young man, who had just the night before received God's approval to bring forth the plates, this was troubling. What had he done? Although he'd been sternly warned by Moroni the night before to "be on his guard,"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;according to Cowdery's account, as Joseph walked to the Hill Cumorah that morning and then uncovered the golden plates, he was influenced by two competing invisible powers working on his mind: one power from heaven prompting him to have the work and will of God as his only motive, and another power whispering he should sell the plates for riches, fame and an easy life. His mind would go back and forth between the reflections.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Upon being shocked, Joseph realized he had been momentarily persuaded by the devil, and he turned to the Lord in prayer. As he prayed, his soul was lit up with the Holy Spirit as Moroni showed a sobering vision of "the prince of darkness [Satan], surrounded by his innumerable train of associates."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Just picture that-Lucifer, himself, and an endless throng of devils all gathered on the hillside united in their efforts to stop this young man. Wow! Moroni then said to Joseph, "All this is shown, that you may never be influenced or overcome by that wicked one."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Through these experiences, Joseph learned that the whispers to seek worldly things brought darkness and confusion, while the thoughts of doing God's will, rather than his own, brought light and spirit. These were important lessons for the future prophet. Joseph then received an important charge from Moroni-to obtain the plates and accomplish the work of God, he must have a "pure heart" and "an eye single to the glory of God."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about keeping our hearts pure from the unholy and unimportant things of the world by having our eyes single to Christ. The Lord exhorts his disciples, "And verily I say unto thee that thou shalt lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better"<sup>8</sup>, and to not walk after worldly idols of Babylon.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;If the devil would use worldly temptations to try to detour the great prophet of our dispensation, then he certainly will tempt you and me in the same way.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As noble youth, worthy to be here at BYU-Idaho, you may be saying, Brother Hammond, we don't smoke, drink, party, or be immoral like other college students, so why are you telling us this? For most of us, the devil doesn't start by tempting us to rob a bank, break the Word of Wisdom, or violate the law of chastity. Instead, he often paves the way by seeking to distract us from our real purpose on this earth using the things of this world. Your purpose in this life is to find the Lord Jesus Christ, commit to Him, and then spend the rest of your life bringing others to Him. The devil is going to do everything to stop you from that because he knows that as an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ, you are literally one in a thousand in this world. You young Latter-day Saints are Satan's worst nightmare because you are the light of the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of nightmares, you remember that in the Sacred Grove, the adversary overcame Joseph so forcefully that he feared "sudden destruction."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;But isn't it interesting that Lucifer's tactic on Cumorah was not to physically overpower Joseph, not to run him over with hard core sin, but to simply detour him by whispering, "Joseph, you can do both, serve God and serve your own interests."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Satan is often portrayed in scripture as a great red dragon or serpent with big teeth and an anaconda squeeze, but he is most effective as a viper in the grass:&nbsp; the silent stalker, the master of the subtle attack, who sneaks up behind us, and bites us on our proverbial Achilles heel, targeting our weakest spot.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Of the serpent who represented Satan, the Lord declared, "And now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which I, the Lord God, had made."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;It is interesting that each time the word&nbsp;<em>subtle</em>&nbsp;is used in scripture, it describes Satan or someone who is following him.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember how Amalickiah, the most devilish antagonist in the Book of Mormon, had his enemy poisoned by degrees.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Satan seeks to poison our souls by degrees, injecting the world into our hearts so gradually that we don't notice what's happening until it's too late. The Lord teaches us line upon line, here a little there a little, and Satan counterfeits the same method.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;President Uchtdorf taught this same principle when he told the story of the plane that was just two degrees off course-a small error that proved fatal when the plane crashed into a mountain. He concluded, "[T]he difference between happiness and misery in individuals, in marriages, and families often comes down to an error of only a few degrees."<sup>17&nbsp;</sup>Avoiding worldly distractions really makes a difference.&nbsp;<br /><br />The adversary often tries to distract us using things that are not inherently evil but become tools in his hands when they begin to consume us or distract us from our true purpose. I love to fish, and I developed that love from my dear dad, and so I always read John 21 with great interest.&nbsp; After Christ's death, Peter and some of the other apostles had returned to Galilee, where the Savior promised to meet them. Peter sounds like he's from Idaho when, in verse 3, he says to the apostles with him, "I go a fishing." I can joke about that because I'm an Idahoan! President James E. Faust said that Peter and his brethren "seemed to have forgotten that they were called to be fishers of men."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Later, when the Savior appears on the shore and teaches Peter over a dinner of fish, the Savior asks Peter a simple but penetrating question, "[L]ovest thou me more than these?"<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Fishing isn't inherently bad. Thank goodness! But if we are not careful, fishing and any other hobby can come between us and the Lord. President Faust taught, "The requirement that we should love the Lord above fish, bank accounts, automobiles, fine clothing, . . . or any other possession is total; it is absolute."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;The Lord repeatedly warns us against setting our hearts on the things of this world.&nbsp; Indeed, why is it that many are called and few are chosen? "Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Almost every time I have listened to President Clark speak to the graduates of BYU&shy;-Idaho, he has powerfully warned them to keep the world out of their hearts. His decision to put aside the prestige and honors of being the Dean of Harvard Business School, and heed a prophet's call to come to Rexburg, shows he is a man who practices what he preaches.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ponder, just for a moment, your Achilles heel, your most vulnerable spot. What worldly weakness do you see in your armor that may be exposed to Satan's cunning attack? Think of a subtle way he could get you. Is it a thirst for riches, fame, and the easy, leisurely life? Or does it take another form, such as an obsession for the nicest cars, toys, and technology, or for the latest fashions, music, movies, or Justin "Beiber fever?" Perhaps it's a fixation with physical appearance that you spend inordinate amounts of time lifting weights, shopping, sun tanning, dieting, or dating only those deemed gorgeous. Or maybe it is letting things like March Madness, Jimmermania, hitting the powder at Grand Targhee, watching "The Office," playing Xbox 360, or letting iPads, iPhones, iTunes, and every other thing that starts with "i" take so much of our time that we neglect the things that matter most. As disciples, we must be careful that we are not so consumed with the latest apps on our phones that we fail to use the most important app of all: applying the gospel in our lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Something that really helped in my college years to be less worldly and more engaged in social and academic life was not having a TV in the apartment. Anyone else find that to be true? Even though I was a C-Span, Discovery Channel, and ESPN fan, shortly after my wife and I were married, we decided that we would not have cable TV in our home. We got a little antenna that would allow us to watch a couple of local channels. For the last 17 years that's all we've had. My mother still can't get over how much money we've saved by cutting cable TV, but the greatest benefit has come to our children. I'm a better dad, and my kids are better kids without a lot of TV and worldly entertainment. Unfortunately, in our world today, the media can be not only distracting, but deadly to our spirituality.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another thing that can distract our eye from the glory of God is a drive to excel in school or career-not so we can lift others, but so that we will be lifted over others. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland recently said to college students, "As you stand on the threshold of your bright and beautiful future, may heaven strip from you this very hour, this very instant, any budding taste you may have for acquiring unseemly wealth or authoritarian power or worldly acclaim for acclaim's sake."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, as I observe you students, I see exemplary disciples who are standing apart from the world. Thousands of you have taken an hour out of your busy schedules to come to this devotional today even as crunch time approaches. I see you making time for temple service and devoting your energies to your Church callings. I notice in class that your focus is less on the grade and the degree and more on the learning. Faithfully, you filter your secular knowledge through the gospel sieve rather than the other way around. I'm so impressed by you young men who choose a major that is motivated less by its financial prospects than by it matching well with your God-given talents and your desires to have time for the church and your family. I respect you young women who are taking the path of my sweet wife-which is to studiously prepare for a meaningful career in the workplace without losing sight of the most important job in the world: being a full-time mother I praise her for that, and her posterity will too.&nbsp;<br /><br />It warms my heart every time I see a young married couple that is expecting or has a little baby.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's such a sacrifice, but it's also such a blessing! As I see you strive to be independent of the world by staying out of debt and limiting your dependence on government welfare, I have hope for our country.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Kudos to you young couples who are told by almost everyone that you are too young, too immature, and too poor to get married, but when you know it's right, you courageously move forward. When Joseph Smith was 21, he didn't have a penny to his name, and his future in-laws were opposed, but he loved Emma and had a confirmation from the Lord that she was the right person. So he pursued her and convinced her to marry him.<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Of course it's a little risky, and you should follow Elder Oaks' counsel to "inquire well" before you get engaged, but whatever you do, don't use the world's standards and judgments when it comes to who to marry and when to marry.<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />As amazing as you are, perhaps as Christ warned in the parable of the sowers, the "cares of this world"<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;threaten to choke out the growth of the gospel in some of our lives. How do we start clearing the weeds of worldliness around us?&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course the answer is not to remain a full-time missionary forever or go live in a cave.&nbsp; We must be in the world, and not of it.<sup>26&nbsp;</sup>May I suggest one key to helping us keep our eye single to the glory of God? Ironically, it is daily studying the very book Satan was seeking to prevent Joseph from obtaining and translating for us: the Book of Mormon.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Ezra Taft Benson pleaded with us all to study the Book of Mormon daily.&nbsp; He gave three reasons "why Latter-day Saints should make the study of the Book of Mormon a lifetime pursuit." I'll only mention one of them: "[the book] was written for our day," President Benson declared. "The Nephites never had the book; neither did the Lamanites of ancient times. It was meant for us."<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Think of it. The Book of Mormon was written for the day of Facebook and iPhones, Netflix and Nintendo, pornography and PlayStation 3. Perhaps that is why, as President Benson explained, "more than anywhere else, we see in the Book of Mormon the dangers of materialism and setting our hearts on the things of the world."<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is just one clear example from Alma 39:14: "Seek not after riches, nor the vain things of this world; for behold, you cannot carry them with you." We often think of "vain" as synonymous with "proud," and it can mean that. But the first definition in the 1828 Webster's Dictionary for that word is "Empty; worthless; having no substance, value or importance."<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />How fitting that the book written for the day of endless options for squandering our time would warn us against investing too much of ourselves in things that ultimately don't really matter at all. In Joseph Smith's day and during most of the world's history, most men didn't have the option of play and triviality; they were just trying to survive. When we feast upon the words of Christ contained in the Book of Mormon, they steer us away from the things that matter least to the things that matter most.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Again, I'm not saying that Facebook or fishing are bad. But we can all benefit from asking whether any of our hobbies are taking too much of our time. Are you spending more time on Facebook than on Foundations? Have you become more proficient at texting than at talking face-to-face with friends in need? Do we have time to surf the Net but not enough time to study our scriptures? Try substituting 30 minutes of daily Book of Mormon study instead of the 30 minutes of time you might now spend on the vain things of this world.&nbsp;<br /><br />Marion G. Romney, a former member of the First Presidency, related that his parents were worried that he might get caught up in the world because he had chosen the spiritually dangerous profession of being a lawyer. He was worried about it too, so he made a goal that he would read the Book of Mormon for 30 minutes every day during one of the busiest times of his life. He credited that practice with keeping him on the path. And he added, "It will hold us as close to the Spirit of the Lord as anything I know."&nbsp;<br /><br />Our little family up here on the stage has been so blessed by the Book of Mormon. As we read together each night it seems that every verse has a powerful message perfectly timed and tuned to our needs. I know it is God's word to edify and fortify us in today's challenges. President Benson said, "[O]ur families may be corrupted by worldly trends and teachings unless we know how to use the book to expose and combat falsehoods."<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;I'm not the greatest father, but probably the most important thing that I can recommend to you future fathers and mothers is to read this book with your family. The Book of Mormon will help us to keep our eye single, for it is the book of books. I love it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Smith was God's instrument to bring forth His work in these latter days. Jesus Christ has the power to crush the serpent Satan through his great atonement, and if we come to Him, he will deliver us from sin and all our worldly desires. I praise Him for his love and mercy. I know He is beckoning us to look to him and not to the world. It is my prayer that we diligently strive to keep our eye single to the glory of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ancient Scripture Faculty Member at BYU</p>
<p>Ann N. Madsen, an Isaiah scholar and poet, teaches ancient scripture at Brigham Young University. She received her MA degree from BYU in ancient studies with a minor in Hebrew. At present, she serves on the Sunday School general board of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She and her husband, Truman, have three children and a Navajo foster son, sixteen grandchildren and, at the moment, twenty-five great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>Jesus said, "My disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;BYU-Idaho's Student Honor Statement explains the way this can happen: "Student honor is following the path of discipleship and learning to be more like Christ. Learning to think, to feel, and to act more as He does." Truman G. Madsen wrote, "If we are not&nbsp;<em>becoming</em>&nbsp;more Christ-like and therefore more God-like, we are not yet his disciples."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;I came to speak to you about becoming a true disciple, standing in your own holy place. There are places where I feel this holiness.&nbsp; My short list includes these four:<br /><br />The temple, which, before we enter, announces itself to us in these sacred words engraved in stone: "Holiness to the Lord, the House of the Lord." This is how I feel about the temple:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>In the Temple</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The quiet closes&nbsp; round me<br />like fog.<br />God's house reverberates<br />with silence,<br />filled with echoes<br />from the faithful<br />who have followed the light<br />to here, like a star.<br />White, we come clothed in white<br />to this place,<br />of radiant light.<br />Dear Host<br />of this Heavenly House,<br />if I come,<br />clothed in the pure white<br />of a new lamb,<br />with my heart as new,<br />may I, too,<br />be lighted?</p>
<p>It is a holy place and we are invited to come inside so that we may "stand and not be moved." Our making covenants assist us in that process.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Provo MTC. When I have had occasion to enter that place, the Spirit is unmistakable. It is like a wave that carries you from the moment you come through the door. Many of you know that from first-hand experience. Many of you will know it. Count it as a unique blessing when you enter that particular holy place.&nbsp;<br /><br />My own home has long been my favorite holy place. Each time I visit the temple I feel I bring home some of the light that is there. I remember one morning, suddenly realizing, as I prayed, that I felt like I was in the temple. I always kneel in the same place, near a window with a lovely view of the rising sun and the mountains.&nbsp;<br /><br />Once I had a Jewish friend visit, with whom I had prayed. She said to me, "I want to see the place where<em>&nbsp;</em>you pray," I said, "Come with me." I showed her where I knelt each day and she stepped into it, like it was a circle of light and said, "I can feel that this is the place." It is not the only place in our home that feels holy. The place where my husband gave patriarchal blessings and the place where we knelt together for family prayer are still holy to me.&nbsp;<br /><br />BYU-Idaho, truly BYU-Idaho. There's something wonderful going on here at BYU-Idaho. I feel it each time I visit. It started even before your temple was built but has increased since. It's tangible. Do you feel it? Are you part of it? Have ye received His image in your countenance[s]?<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Is His law written in your<em>&nbsp;</em>heart?<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Does purity shine from your eyes?&nbsp;<br /><br />The holiness here includes you. It includes me. We are not outside looking in, we are inside, looking out. We came "trailing clouds of glory." (Wordsworth) We were born for glory. Glory is our destiny. We have the tools we need to achieve it:&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this with the agency to choose, not just stand and watch but to act, not merely be acted upon. This is our time on earth. This is our moment. So what shall we do?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My prayer for today has been that I may help you see some of the ways you can construct your own holy place, sanctify your own space and then stand in it and not be moved. In the new Church Handbook I was inspired to read these words:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Followers of Christ are invited to 'gather,' 'stand in holy places,' and 'be not moved.' These holy places include temples, homes, and chapels. The presence of the Spirit and the behavior of those within these physical structures are what make them 'holy places.' Wherever Church members live, they should establish a home where the Spirit is present. All members of the Church can make efforts to ensure that their place of residence provides a place of sanctuary from the world."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him. And every[one] that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Link that to "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."<sup>7</sup><em>&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em><em><br /></em>Why do we become purified? So that we may someday see God. George Bernard Shaw had it right: "Better keep yourself clean and bright. You are the window through which you must see the world."&nbsp;<br /><br />How do we become purified? Through the righteous use of our bodies; our behavior. We learn much about this in the temple.&nbsp;<br /><br />By what we see and choose to watch or not watch. "Whatever you read, listen to, or look at has an effect on you." I am quoting from "For the Strength<em>&nbsp;</em>of Youth." Why does that little booklet have the word "strength" in its title? "My strength is as the strength of ten because my heart is pure." (Tennyson)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A couple of examples that you may choose to look at are the Sports Illustrated Swim Suit Issue, or the Victoria Secret Fashion Show. Pornography is seldom labeled "porn." We must recognize it for ourselves. The 13th Article of Faith helps: "If there is anything virtuous, lovely or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things!" Who knew we would have to sift through garbage to find the virtuous?&nbsp;<br /><br />By what we hear and choose to listen to or not to listen to. If you have time to go to Facebook, you have time to go to FamilySearch. If you own an iPod, you can get on the Mormon Channel, where they announce frequently: "Our goal is to bring people unto Christ, to proclaim His Gospel and to testify that He lives!" Is there anything else you listen to that makes that claim?&nbsp;<br /><br />What else can you find? Words of living prophets, will be spoken next week in General Conference.&nbsp; Will you hang on every word?&nbsp; Take note of special imperatives spoken just for you? Do you ever sleep through or just not hear the very answers from God you have been pleading for? You can replay it on your iPod or computer. Or hear that devotional you loved again and again. Or BYU speeches. Podcasts are a goldmine of inspiring words and music. Don't let Halo 3 or Facebook steal your time from this treasure.&nbsp;<br /><br />By what we say and choose not to say. "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;mouth, but that which is good."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;"How you speak says much about who you are. Always use the names of God and Jesus Christ with reverence and respect. Misusing their names is a sin. Foul language harms your spirit and degrades you. Use language that uplifts, encourages and complements others."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />No matter what it is, it does not need to be said right now. Think, ponder, pray, edit. Take time to be holy and measure your words. Some things should never be spoken at all. "Mary kept all these things in her heart." In the world today, sometimes it feels like nothing is sacred. Can you keep a bright sense of what is sacred? Such sacred things stored in your heart will become your own hidden treasures, shared only with God. The temple teaches us how that works. "Remember that that which cometh from above is sacred, and must be spoken with care, and by constraint of the Spirit."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;What a sweet safeguard the Spirit can be to our tongues.&nbsp;<br /><br />By what we wear and choose not to wear. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland says it well, "Do not look like what you do not think."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;"Through your dress and appearance, you can show the Lord that you know how precious your body is."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Miss Idaho, a BYU student, chose to wear a one-piece swimsuit in a Miss America Pageant in 2011, where all the others wore scant bikinis - cookie cutter alike. Heavenly Father gave Adam and Eve sacred clothing to cover their nakedness. Satan has been trying to uncover and expose our bodies ever since.&nbsp;<br /><br />By what we eat, taste and choose not to taste. As Lloyd D. Newell says so well, "The Word of Wisdom is a bulwark against enslavement to harmful and addictive substances, a safeguard against evil designs and a reminder that the body is a Temple - a sacred, priceless possession that must be protected."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;We are taught to eat wholesome food. If we do, we will avoid obesity and disease. We should not overeat or undereat. In Gospel Principles we read: "We should avoid anything we know is harmful to our bodies, and we should not use any substance that is habit forming. The Word of Wisdom does not tell us everything to avoid or consume, but it does give us guidelines."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />By what we touch and choose not to touch. The following words are not my own.&nbsp; They are words that should be familiar to all of us:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Before marriage, do not do anything to arouse the powerful emotions that must be expressed only in marriage. Do not participate in passionate kissing, lie on top of another person, or touch the private, sacred parts of another person's body, with or without clothing. Do not allow anyone to do that with you. Do not arouse those emotions in your own body."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The devil would fool you into thinking you can tiptoe around such behavior, but you must eliminate NCMOs - "Non-Committal Make Outs." He envies you and your body. Don't let him tutor you in the unrighteous use of your precious body. No wonder we are taught in the temple God's purposes for our bodies.&nbsp;<br /><br />My daughter in law teaches her children, "Kissing is not a recreational activity." I would add that kissing is a sublime expression of eternal love. The last expression of that love offered to me from my dying husband was a kiss. The most sublime kiss you can look forward to is the one across an altar just after you have been sealed to your eternal companion. That tender kiss signals the beginning of your eternity together. You must live pure for such moments.&nbsp;<br /><br />In an ever-darkening world, we can become points of light. We know with great clarity how this is done. "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous and in doing good to all men." And we live what we believe. Every day. I wrote these lines. Listen carefully:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Let the World change its shape to fit me.<br />I'll not change<br />Chameleon-like<br />To walk through<br />Well-worn ruts.<br />I came to conquer<br />Not to slink and slide<br />Unnoticed in the crowd.<br />I came to win<br />A mastery over me,<br />To teach my skin<br />My soul's dimensions for eternity</p>
<p>We need to teach our bodies our soul's dimensions for eternity. We were born for glory and are making choices each day that can bring us closer to that goal. The righteous use of our bodies is important in this effort. In April 2007, President Gordon B. Hinckley gave a talk entitled, "I Am Clean." In it he tells a story:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It concerns President Joseph F. Smith, who served as President of the Church from 1901 to 1918, altogether 17 years. Joseph F. Smith was the son of Hyrum Smith, the nephew of Joseph the Prophet . . . At the age of 15 he was called on a mission to Hawaii. . . He learned to speak their language and to love them. While serving there he experienced a remarkable dream."</p>
<p>Then President Hinckley quotes from Joseph F. Smith's own words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"'I was very much oppressed [when I was] on a mission. . . (I felt that I was) just a boy, that I hardly dared look a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;man in the face. While in that condition I dreamed [one night] that I was on a journey, and I was impressed that I ought to hurry-hurry with all my might, for fear I might be too late. I rushed on my way as fast as I possibly could, and I was conscious of having . . . a handkerchief with a small bundle wrapped in it. . . finally I came to a wonderful mansion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I thought I knew that was my destination.'&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"'As I passed towards it, as fast as I could, I saw a notice [which read ... 'Bath.'] I turned aside quickly and went into the bath and washed myself clean. I opened up this little bundle that I had, and there was [some] white, clean [clothing . . . and I put [it] on. Then I rushed to what appeared to be a great door. I knocked and the door opened, and the man who stood there was the Prophet Joseph Smith. He looked at me a little reprovingly, and the first words he said [were]: 'Joseph, you are late.' Yet I took confidence and [replied]: 'Yes, but I am clean-I am clean!' He clasped my hand and drew me in."&nbsp; (<em>Gospel Doctrine,</em>&nbsp;5th ed. [1939], 542-43).</p>
<p>President Hinckley goes on to say:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The result of that dream was that a boy was changed into a man. His declaration 'I am clean' gave him self-assurance and courage in facing anyone or any situation . . ."</p>
<p>President Hinckley continues:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Said Isaiah the prophet: 'Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;' 'Learn to do well;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.' 'Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool" (Isaiah 1:16-18). In modern revelation the Lord has said: 'Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord (Doctrine and Covenants 33:5)."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>That's what we're talking about, being clean. It's all about being clean, isn't it?&nbsp; Purified, cleansed, sanctified are all closely related words. John 13:8-10 speaks of "Clean every whit."&nbsp;<br /><br />My husband often called the temple a sanctuary and it occurred to me, that it's because it is a<em>&nbsp;</em>place where we learn to be sanctified. If the temple is a sanctuary or place that we can become sanctified then the sacrament is the time each week, a space we can wall off, in which we can be cleansed and renewed and increase our worthiness for temple worship. "No unclean thing can enter His presence." All that you take into your soul should sanctify you.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each week we come to the sacrament to measure ourselves standing next to Jesus Christ, our eternal standard. What do we bring? We bring Him our sins, our broken heart and contrite spirit remembering again His blessed sacrifice for us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The Sacrament Prayers</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The words are repeated<br />once again<br />this sacred, Sabbath time.<br />Words I can trace<br />through the week<br />but this time<br />unique,<br />spoken quietly<br />in youthful<br />intonation<br />and the nourishment<br />is proffered<br />to me<br />by a boy's hand<br />in exchange<br />for<br />my changing.</p>
<p>Picture a conduit of light with you in it, sitting silently during the sacrament, with head bowed, asking, "How holy am I? Why do I promise to remember Christ? What is the exchange that is taking place? I sacrifice [all] my sins and ask with all my heart each week, 'What lack I yet? What are my sins?"<em>&nbsp;</em>When the answer comes, I write it down. In 1995 I wrote down these impressions and I keep a copy in my scriptures to refer to during the sacrament:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the sacrament, I take into myself the symbols of a perfect life, a life which becomes my everlasting example of goodness and decency. And I do it with others, sitting side by side, that through this ordinance we may be "partakers of the divine nature."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;"By partaking, accompanied by the Spirit of God, we are preparing ourselves to be sufficiently pure to enter His presence . . . the Spirit is invited in and comes to stay."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We partake of a tiny piece of bread, which has been blessed and sanctified to our souls' good, a tiny piece of bread, symbolizing the resplendent, resurrected body of Him who redeems us. We drink a single swallow of water in the smallest of cups, symbolizing His blood, which cleanses our inner vessel and washes clean our souls.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our coming out of sacrament meeting should be like Joseph F. Smith's coming out of that bath-house, fresh and clean. That is the exchange, His love for us; a pure love that never fails; an Atonement that is infinite and eternal in exchange for our growing love for Him, which enables our changing. We remember Him, we promise again and again to always remember Him so that&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;may become like Him, not His everlasting inferior, but like Him in every way we have learned to observe and feel in our hearts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We must become more like Him, to think, to feel to act more like He does. I cannot ignore His sacrifice for me. In the words of President James E. Faust:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I feel His love, the price He paid.<br />How many drops of blood were spilled for me?<br />With Saints of old in joyful cry,<br />I too can testify:<br />This is the Christ.<br />This is the Christ, the holy Son of God,<br />Our Saviour, Lord, Redeemer of mankind.<br />This is the Christ, the healer of our souls,<br />Who ransomed us with love divine.<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>This is the Christ we remember. One day I had a moment in Gethsemane alone in the lovely church built there with violet stained glass windows to make it seem always night-time, the time when Jesus plead with His Father to let the awful cup pass, and set the pattern for us forever, saying, "Nevertheless, not<em>&nbsp;</em>my will but Thine be done."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It was a strangely quiet time for that usually crowded place of pilgrimage. No one was in sight. I was brimming with love and gratitude and felt the Spirit in my pounding heart. I sank to my knees to quietly whisper a prayer. I knew that somewhere nearby, not far from where I knelt He had knelt and prayed in agony. How could I not pour out my love and thanks? I wept. I pictured His precious body racked in inexpressible pain, some of it on my behalf. I felt drawn to Him by the magnet of His redeeming love.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As I arose from my knees, I had been able to say only a small part of what I had felt. I was prompted to write down the last of the prayer I had spoken. I wanted to remember the moment, the sacred space, the sanctifying time. Gratitude helps sanctify us. These are the words I wrote. I didn't realize it was poetry until I wrote it down:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Beneath the Violet Windows - Gethsemane</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Dear Lord Jesus,<br />Thou who lovest<br />The people of the Mosque,<br />Who would have gathered<br />The people of the synagogue,<br />Whose arms continue open<br />To each saffron-robed monk<br />And searching nun,<br />Lord of the children<br />And the childlike,<br />Pulled by thy love,<br />Seized by thy suffering,<br />Drawn to thee<br />By everlasting cords,<br />I come!</p>
<p>How can I duplicate each sacrament time, these sacred feelings? Can I go in my mind to the place where He knelt? Can I offer my list of this week's sins to Him from my broken heart, on the altar we call a sacrament table? Can I give away all my sins to know Him and by that action become more like Him?&nbsp; How could I know Him better than by adopting His attributes into my life? Can I submit my will to His and cry out from my heart, "Dear Lord Jesus, I come!" I will become the pure in heart thou knowest I can be. I will create my own sacred space and resolutely stand in it. I will walk out of each sacrament meeting feeling cleansed. It may take time but I will one day say simply, "I am clean, I am clean."&nbsp;<br /><br />May we all love the Sacrament, which has the power to cleanse us, that we may sanctify our own space, and at last meet the Lord, seeing Him as He is, and that we are like Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Kim B. Clark became the 15th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in August 2005. &nbsp;From April 2007 through April 2014, he served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br /><br />President Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and raised in Spokane, Washington. &nbsp;After serving as a missionary for the Church in Germany, he married his wife, Sue, in 1971. &nbsp;President Clark earned bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in economics from Harvard University.<br /><br />In 1978 Kim Clark became a member of the faculty at the Harvard Business School, and in 1995 he became dean of the school. &nbsp;He served in that capacity until his departure to become the president of BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />President and Sister Clark are the parents of 7 children and the grandparents of 22 grandchildren.</p>
<p>I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to you at the beginning of this spring semester. Sister Clark and I love you very much.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the overarching themes in the Book of Mormon is captured in this remarkable promise the Lord made to Lehi and to all who come to the land of promise:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In this verse the Lord teaches us that the opposite of prospering is to be cut off from His presence and, thus, from all of the blessings that flow from Him. To prosper in the land is to receive all the blessings that God has prepared for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Obedience connects us to the Savior and opens channels for His love and power to flow into us, much like life-giving nutrients flow from the trunk of a tree into its branches. The Savior said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; . . .&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>The Lord gives us commandments so that we might have His love, joy, and power in our lives. When we disobey those commandments, we weaken our connection to Him. If we do not repent, we become cut off from the source of divine power and joy in life. But the more we obey His commandments, the more we draw near to Him, the stronger the connection becomes, the greater the joy we experience, and the more we become like Him. We abide in Christ, and we prosper in the land. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Once we see commandments as a blessing, our whole attitude towards obedience changes. Obedience stops being something that weighs on us because we are supposed to do it and becomes something we want to do because we know it brings blessings and joy, and we know it is the way to become more like Christ. The kind of obedience that connects us to Christ and brings divine love, power, and joy into our lives is not a reluctant, surface kind of obedience. It is obedience of the whole heart and soul.&nbsp; It is deep obedience.&nbsp;President Ezra Taft Benson described that change of attitude and deep obedience in this&nbsp;way: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"When obedience ceases to be an irritant and becomes our quest, in that moment God will endow us with power."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I want you to prosper in this land. I want you to have every blessing God has prepared for you at BYU-Idaho and all through your lives. That is why I will speak today about deep obedience to the commandments of the Lord. I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Introduction</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Please turn with me to the 59th section of the Doctrine and Covenants given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in Jackson County, Missouri, on August 7, 1831. Section 59 is a wonderful statement of the Lord's hopes for, and promised blessings to, those who keep His commandments. In verses 1 through 4 the Lord addresses the revelation to those "whose feet stand upon the land of Zion," and promises them wonderful blessings if they are "faithful and diligent before [Him]."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We can liken this scripture to ourselves. We, too, have come to a place set apart for us where we seek to build Zion. And the Lord will bless us just as He promised to bless the Missouri Saints.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, this is an invitation from the Lord to rise up to the great privileges and responsibilities before us. Just look around at all He has prepared for us. Think of the temple on the hill, the opportunities in this university, and this beautiful new Center in which we gather. Think about why God would put all of this in one place and then bring us here to study, work, and learn together.&nbsp; We have been called to discipleship and leadership in the great work of the Lord in the last dispensation. And the way forward and upward, the way to prosper in the land, is deep obedience to the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />As we read section 59 together, I will highlight five dimensions of deep obedience: (1) love God with all your heart; (2) walk the strait and narrow path; (3) bring to the Lord a sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit; (4) keep the Sabbath Day holy; and (5) do all these things with gratitude and a cheerful heart.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's begin with the love of God in verse 5.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Love God . . . with all your heart</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>Wherefore, I give unto them [us] a commandment, saying thus:&nbsp; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father wants all we have to give-our physical and mental capacity, our attitudes and desires-totally committed to serving Him in the name of His Son. He wants to write the gospel covenants in our hearts so that the promises we make to Him become our deepest desires, our most important commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As the Lord told Jeremiah:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; . . . I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>To love is a verb; it is a principle of action. We love God with all of our hearts by acting on our righteous desires and keeping our covenants all of the time. To love God with all our hearts, we must have integrity of heart: a heart that is sound, whole, with no hypocrisy, no shortcuts, no conflicting commitments, and no competing desires. Our attitudes, desires, choices, and actions must be fully aligned with, and submissive to, the will of the Lord all the time. This is deep obedience. It is the same obedience that Christ gave to His Father. When we are deeply obedient to the Savior, we do what is right and we become what is right. We become more and more like Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is a lifelong journey of the heart. It does not happen in a day or a week or a year. We strive to be deeply obedient, and step-by-step the Savior changes our hearts; He gives us new hearts. This is not something we can do by ourselves; there is no self-improvement plan, no six easy steps to a new heart. A new heart comes as a gift from the Savior. That gift is what Alma called the mighty change of heart that comes by the power of the Atonement of Christ through the ministry of the Holy Ghost to those who exercise faith in Christ and "walk in [His] statutes."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;It is a journey of deep obedience in the strait and narrow path. &nbsp;Please read with me verses 6 and&nbsp;7 about that path.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Walk the Strait and Narrow Path</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&nbsp; Thou shalt not steal; neither commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>These commandments of service, virtue, and gratitude-and others we could cite like the Word of Wisdom and the law of tithing-are familiar to us. They mark the path to exaltation and eternal life.&nbsp;<br /><br />For just a moment, reflect on that phrase "and nothing like unto it." It is deep obedience, brothers and sisters. Those of you who spend time playing video games where you kill other people ought to reflect on that scripture. As the Lord Himself taught, that path is strait and narrow. Strait is s-t-r-a-i-t. It means strict as well as narrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This is what the Lord said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the only name "given under heaven whereby man can be saved."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;In that work of salvation "no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, the Savior "cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;In the strait and narrow path, our obedience must be deep; it must be exact, disciplined, and complete.&nbsp;<br /><br />Your BYU-Idaho experience is part of the Lord's plan for you to learn to walk the strait and narrow path. In that experience the Honor Code is central. It is a protection against the forces of evil and a preparation for the higher laws, ordinances, and commandments that the Lord will give you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Before you came to BYU-Idaho, each of you promised you would live by the Honor Code. Each person who works here makes the same promise. Keeping our promises and living the Honor Code requires deep obedience. I want to share with you three parables that illustrate this principle:&nbsp;<br /><br />Number One: One day while working on a long writing assignment, a young woman finds an essay on the internet on her topic. Thinking "the internet is so great," she copies two paragraphs and incorporates them into her first draft.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later, the words "We believe in being honest" come into her mind. (She learned them in Primary.) She decides to make the paragraphs into quotes and include footnotes with the citations.&nbsp;<br /><br />Number Two: A returned missionary catches himself starting to daydream about physical intimacy with his girlfriend. His first thought is, "I'm all right; she has things under control, and we haven't crossed the line.&nbsp; But at that very moment a scripture comes into his mind (a scripture he taught his investigators on his mission):&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br />He resolves to keep those daydreams out of his thoughts and to treat his girlfriend with greater respect.&nbsp;<br /><br />Number Three: A sister stands in front of the mirror thinking about wearing an outfit to Church that she would never wear during the week: the top is a borderline low-cut blouse; the skirt is three inches above her knee.&nbsp;<br /><br />As she looks at the outfit in the mirror, a thought comes to her: Isn't it ironic that the day you would pick to break your promise to live standards of modesty would be the Sabbath Day? She puts the outfit away.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is deep obedience: exact, disciplined, and complete. Each of these students was tempted to rationalize breaking their covenants.&nbsp; But each listened to the Spirit and chose to walk the strait and narrow path.&nbsp;<br /><br />Living the Honor Code with deep obedience sets us on a course very different from the ways of the world. Modern society has become increasingly casual in its treatment of sacred things; in its approach to personal, intimate relationships; and, of course, in dress and grooming. In this context the word "casual" means without purpose, design, or intention; careless or indifferent. When we become casual in our approach to the gospel, we lose reverence for the sacred, decrease in personal obedience, and falter in purpose. We become prey to false ideas as Nephi prophesied:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God-he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ; there is no harm in this; . . . and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, do not falter! Do not believe these false ideas. Please do not be casual in the way you treat the commandments and the promises you made to live the Honor Code. Strive to be exact in your obedience. Pray for help to be honest and virtuous in thought, attitude, and action.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know the Savior will help you become deeply obedient to His commandments. In fact, there is divine help and support all along the path, even when we stumble. We gain access to that help when we come to the Lord with a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Let's look at verse 8 in section 59.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Bring to the Lord a Broken Heart and Contrite Spirit</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>Elder Bruce Porter explained the nature of this sacrifice:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When our hearts are broken, we are completely open to the Spirit of God and recognize our dependence on Him for all that we have and all that we are. The sacrifice so entailed is a sacrifice of pride in all its forms. Like malleable clay in the hands of a skilled potter, the brokenhearted can be molded and shaped in the hands of the Master.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>We all need the touch of the Master's hand. The strait and narrow path is sometimes difficult, but the Savior is always there to strengthen us and pick us up when we stumble. Sometimes we choose poorly and sin.&nbsp; Sometimes we need help to overcome weaknesses and deepen our obedience. We all need the mercy and grace that comes through the Atonement of Christ. We all need to repent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Spencer W. Kimball said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If we are humble and desirous of living the gospel, we will come to think of repentance as applying to everything we do in life, whether it be spiritual or temporal in nature.&nbsp; Repentance is for every soul who has not yet reached perfection.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>Elder Russell M. Nelson taught this broad view of repentance:<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When Jesus said "repent," He asked us to change-to change our mind, knowledge, and spirit . . .&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . to change our ways, to come unto Him, and be more like Him.&nbsp; This requires a total change.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>This is the mighty change of heart that comes through the transforming power of Christ to those who feel godly sorrow and seek that mighty change with a broken heart and a contrite spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Benson said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Godly sorrow is a gift of the Spirit.&nbsp; It is a deep realization that our actions have offended our Father and our God.&nbsp; It is the sharp and keen awareness that our behavior caused the Savior, He who knew no sin, even the greatest of all, to endure agony and suffering.&nbsp; Our sins caused Him to bleed at every pore.&nbsp; This very real mental and spiritual anguish is what the scriptures refer to as having "a broken heart and a contrite spirit."&nbsp; Such a spirit is the absolute prerequisite for true repentance.<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>How we keep His commandments expresses our feelings about the Lord Jesus Christ. The commandments are not a distant, impersonal set of rules. They are His. And He gives them to us because He loves us. He invites us to come to Him in deep obedience with a broken heart so that He may mold and shape us, strengthen us in keeping our covenants, lift us up when we stumble, heal us, forgive us, cleanse our souls, and redeem us with His almighty love and power. If we choose to disobey, we turn away from Him. But Jesus is infinitely merciful and kind. When we realize we have turned away, we can turn back to Him. The way back is repentance, forsaking sin, changing our ways, and opening our hearts to Christ. Think for a moment of His supernal gift to us. We are not trapped in our sins and weaknesses with no way out. We can change. We can have a new heart. We can become deeply obedient. If we will turn to Him with a broken heart, He will strengthen, forgive, bless, and heal as only He can. He is the Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Keep the Sabbath Day Holy</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>We now turn to the Sabbath Day.&nbsp; Let's read verses 9 to 11:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all times;<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>Everything that the Lord commands us to do will help us keep the world out of our hearts.&nbsp; But to be more fully unspotted from the world, the Lord commands us to worship in "the house of prayer"<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;and participate in the ordinance of the sacrament on His holy day. Please note the use of the words "offer up thy sacraments" in verse 9. When we participate in this sacred ordinance in the way the Lord intends, we make an offering of devotion to God: we partake of the emblems of the sacrament in remembrance of the suffering, sacrifice, and glorious resurrection of the Son of God. We witness to our Heavenly Father our willingness to take upon ourselves the name of Christ, to "always remember Him and [to] keep His commandments . . . that [we might] always have his Spirit to be with [us]."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />With these vows we renew our covenants and place Jesus Christ at the very center of our lives. He is the source of living water; He is the Bread of Life. As He taught us:&nbsp; He is the vine; we are the branches. On His holy day we commemorate three life-giving miracles-the Creation, the Atonement, and the Resurrection. The Sabbath is not a day for recreation, for work, or for worldly pursuits. What we do and say, where we go, and what we wear should reflect that it is the Lord's day-a day of spiritual rest, renewal, and new life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Please notice that in verse 11 the Lord commands us to offer up our Sabbath vows every day and at all times. The Sabbath, therefore, is not only a single day of rest, renewal, and new life. It should set the tone for our whole week, every week. In that sense the Sabbath is like the spiritual creation for the upcoming week.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder David A. Bednar taught this about prayer and spiritual creation:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Meaningful morning prayer is an important element in the spiritual creation of each day-and precedes the temporal creation or the actual execution of the day.&nbsp; Just as the temporal creation was linked to and [is] a continuation of the spiritual creation, so meaningful morning and evening prayers are linked to and are a continuation of each other.<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>Think about the Sabbath Day and the rest of our week in this same way. The Sabbath Day should set the tone for the week ahead. It should create a spiritual framework that carries over into the week in our prayers, our scripture study, our temple worship, our service, and our covenant keeping every day. This is deep obedience that will keep the world out of our hearts and the Spirit of the Lord in them.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Be Cheerful and Grateful</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>I come now to the Lord's command to be cheerful and grateful. Look at verses 15-16 in section 59.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances,&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">. . . the fulness of the earth is yours . . .<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>This is the Lord's invitation to do all He has commanded with an attitude of good cheer and gratitude. Gratitude and cheerfulness go together. They are companion feelings in the righteous heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior often said, "Be of good cheer."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;This was not an invitation to a kind of mindless, carefree, no responsibility happiness. It was an invitation to see things as they really are. His invitation to "Be of good cheer"<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;was always accompanied by phrases reminding us of His presence, His power, and His love:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is I; be not afraid.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>I have overcome the world.<sup>28</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup></sup>I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you.<sup>29</sup></p>
<p>When we understand how richly the Lord blesses us when we obey, how merciful He is when we repent, and how generous He is when we seek His help, it is easy to be of good cheer. The gospel truly is good news.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Concluding Thoughts and Testimony</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The Lord's message of love and hope in section 59 comes with a warning in verse 21:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.<sup>30</sup></p>
<p>Pride, ingratitude, selfishness, and unrighteousness mark those who enter in at the wide gate and walk the broad path that spirals down to destruction. In contrast, those who find the path which leads to eternal life love God with all their heart, walk the strait and narrow path, bring to the Lord a broken heart and a contrite spirit, keep the Sabbath Day holy, and do all things with gratitude and a cheerful heart.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is deep obedience and it brings these marvelous promises:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward,<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;[the good things of the earth;<sup>32</sup>blessings from above, commandments not a few, and revelations in their time<sup>33</sup>] even peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come.<sup>34</sup></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, if you will be deeply obedient to the commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ, you will be connected to Him; you will prosper in the land; you will have joy and become more and more like Him through His mercy and grace and the supernal love of our Father in Heaven. I so testify.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I leave you with my witness that God lives. Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. He marked the path of deep obedience, and He led the way. The promises are true, and the promises are yours. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, this is a humbling yet inspiring opportunity. The assignment to address you here in the BYU-Idaho Center has caused me to spend many hours pondering, reflecting, fasting, and praying. I appreciate the music and the prayer that have calmed my heart and steadied my nerves. It helps, more than you can imagine, that I feel like I am among friends. I wish above all to express appreciation to a kind and loving Heavenly Father, for I know that the message I will deliver today has come to me from Him, through the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />This is a wonderful time of the year. We are just two days past the celebration of Easter and even here in Rexburg Idaho there are signs of spring! The trees, shrubs, bulb flowers, and grasses are showing signs of new life just as we have celebrated the newness of life that is represented by the resurrection of the Savior on that first Easter morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Fifteen years ago this month a popular news magazine had an article entitled, "Rethinking the Resurrection," in which Christian scholars analyzed and debated the issue of whether the resurrection of Jesus Christ ever really occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />One, at the time a New Testament scholar at Vanderbilt Divinity School, suggested that the Resurrection was an "empty formula" that must be rejected by anyone holding a "scientific world view." This same scholar indicated that the post-crucifixion sightings of the Savior could be attributed to "interpsychic experiences."&nbsp;<br /><br />Another, which the article described as a "prolific Biblical scholar at DePaul University in Chicago," offered that the tomb was indeed empty on Easter morning because Christ's body had "been devoured by wild dogs."&nbsp;<br /><br />While other similar explanations could be quoted from the article, I think these two will suffice to give you a feel for the intellectual reasoning of Christian scholars who, unaided by the gift of the Holy Ghost and without the benefit of the Restored Gospel are "Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Among Latter-day Saints there should be no such misunderstanding on the topic of the resurrection. The resurrection was the capstone to the atonement of Jesus Christ. To deny the literal resurrection of Jesus Christ is not merely to deny the crowning and final act of the atonement it is to deny the whole of the atonement. Without the empty tomb, the suffering in Gethsemane and the death on Golgatha would have been for naught.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's consider together the great benefit that the restoration of the gospel has on our understanding of the plan of salvation, of which the resurrection is a central tenet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Because of the restoration, we understand that we lived in a pre-mortal spirit state with our Heavenly Father. In the pre-existence we could see our Father and we knew that, while we were only spirits, He has a glorified body of flesh and bone. We wanted to become like our Father and desired to obtain a body. We know that Heavenly Father authored a plan that would allow us to have the experience of living in mortality with a physical body, use agency to make choices in this life, be tested as we walk by faith, and thereby progress to become like Him and eventually, if we use our agency properly, return to His presence.&nbsp;<br /><br />We understand that part of this plan required that this Earth be created. The creation of the Earth is a manifestation of the love of our Heavenly Father. The beauty of the Earth and the abundance that it yields forth are evidences that Heavenly Father wants us to be happy in this second estate and designed a place were we could be so.&nbsp;<br /><br />We understand that following the creation of the Earth, the plants, and the animals, our first parents, Adam and Eve, were created in the express likeness of the Father and placed in the Garden of Eden. They lived there is a state of innocence without the ability to keep the first commandment that they were given, to multiply and replenish the Earth because they were keeping the second commandment, to not partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.&nbsp;<br /><br />We understand that through the wise use of their agency they brought about the Fall and were cast out of the garden and out of God's physical presence. Had Adam not fallen, as Lehi teaches,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"he would have remained in the Garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end. And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin... Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>We understand that the joy Lehi refers to is brought to pass because the Father's plan provided a way for us to be redeemed from the Fall. In the very next verse in 2 Nephi chapter two, Lehi declares "And the Messiah cometh in the fullness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Surely, the understanding that there would be a Savior to redeem us is part of the reason that in our pre-mortal estate "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Because of the restoration of the gospel, we understand that the Fall brought two distinct deaths into the world, one spiritual and one physical. The spiritual death is a natural result of sin and transgression and is characterized by our being separated from the presence of our Heavenly Father. The physical death is the natural result of our mortal existence and is characterized by the separation of our body from our spirit. We shouted for joy those long years ago because we knew a Savior, Jesus Christ, would come into the world to overcome both spiritual and physical death.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Spiritual death is overcome as we exercise our agency, repent of our sins, and are reconciled to God through the merits and mercies of the Savior and His atonement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In his counsel to his son, Jacob, the prophet Lehi teaches us about the conditions on which forgiveness of sins is based: "Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Physical death, on the other hand, is overcome as a free gift to all by virtue of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul declared, "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you see the importance of the resurrection in the plan of salvation? Do you see how the entire plan would be thwarted without the resurrection? Perhaps pondering on the following questions will help you:&nbsp;<br /><br />For what purpose would Christ have taken upon Himself our sins and our sorrows and our pains and our afflictions had He not also "become the first fruits of them that slept?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To what end would we repent of the sins committed in mortality and thereby receive a remission of those sins without the hope of a resurrection from the dead?&nbsp;<br /><br />If Christ had suffered for our sins and thereby given us the opportunity to repent, but had not resurrected from the dead and given us hope for a resurrection ourselves, then the best we could hope for after the death of our mortal bodies would be to live forever as a spirit.&nbsp; But that was the state in which we found ourselves before coming to this Earth. We could have lived forever as spirits without this Earth experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You see, brothers and sisters, without the resurrection the entire purpose for which the Earth was created becomes null and void. We came here to gain a body and to return back to our Heavenly Father having become like Him. The way to become like Him involves two equally important components. The first is to completely apply the atonement in our lives by repenting of all of our sins and becoming Holy as He is Holy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord himself said to Adam,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence; for, in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>The second and equally important component of becoming like our Heavenly Father is that we have to have a body like the one He has. Our Heavenly Father will preside over the Celestial Kingdom. The Lord explained to the prophet Joseph Smith in the 88<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;section of the Doctrine and Covenants that those whose spirits have become celestial will be resurrected with a celestial body and will inherit that kingdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And the spirit and the body are the soul of man. And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul. And the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all things, in whose bosom it is decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth shall inherit it. Therefore, it must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that it may be prepared for the celestial glory; For after it hath filled the measure of its creation, it shall be crowned with glory, even with the presence of God the Father. That bodies who are of the celestial kingdom may possess it forever and ever; for, for this intent was it made and created, and for this intent are they sanctified... They who are of a celestial spirit shall receive the same body which was a natural body; even ye shall receive your bodies, and your glory shall be that glory by which your bodies are quickened.&nbsp; Ye who are quickened by a portion of the celestial glory shall then receive of the same, even a fullness."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>To not understand the resurrection is fundamentally to not understand the purpose of the atonement, the need for the Fall, the noble role of Adam and Eve, the true nature and purpose of the creation, and indeed, the reality of our pre-existent state. In essence, to not understand the resurrection is to not understand the nature of God and the purpose of His plan of happiness for His children. No wonder that the Lord declared, "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Since the resurrection is such a pivotal part of the plan of salvation, it should not surprise us that there are many witnesses of the risen Lord. Let's briefly review the scriptural accounts of those who saw the Savior after the crucifixion and became eyewitnesses of His resurrection:&nbsp;<br /><br />In Mark 16:9 we read that when "Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene..." Later that same day He walked with two disciples on the road to Emmaus<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;and "sat at meat with them, and took bread and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him..."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;These two disciples quickly arose and returned to Jerusalem to report to the Apostles that the Lord had risen and appeared unto Simon.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />On that same evening Christ appeared to the disciples. In Luke it records "And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />One week later, again on the first day of the week, Jesus appeared unto the 11 with Thomas who had been absent the week before. This was the occasion when Jesus proclaimed "because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Subsequently he showed himself to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias,<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;to Stephen on the occasion of his martyrdom,<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;to Paul on the road to Damascas,<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;to above 500 brethren at once,<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;and to the Apostles over a 40-day period on numerous occasions.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition to apostles and disciples who lived in the meridian of time, whose testimonies of the Savior are recorded in the Bible, the Lord has also given us another testament of Jesus Christ. To the prophet Enoch the Lord declared, "And righteousness will I send down out of heaven; and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of mine Only Begotten; his resurrection from the dead; yea, and also the resurrection of all men..."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;I testify that the Book of Mormon is the "truth sent forth out of the earth" to bear testimony of the Lord and of His resurrection and of the resurrection of all men.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior's appearances to the Nephite multitude found in 3 Nephi are some of the most compelling testimonies of the resurrection ever recorded.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying: Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world. And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffer the will of the Father in all things from the beginning...Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come."<sup>21</sup></p>
<p>In chapters 19 and 27 of 3 Nephi we read of two other appearances of the resurrected Savior to the Nephites. The Book of Mormon also records the visitation of the Lord, after his resurrection, to the prophet Mormon<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;when he was only 15 years old, and to Mormon's son, Moroni. In Moroni's own words we read,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things; And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever. Amen."<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>As clear evidence that the Lord loves His people in every dispensation of time, we have modern witnesses of the resurrection as well. The Prophet Joseph Smith, as a young boy with a desire to know which of the churches in his day was the true church of Christ on the earth, knelt in a grove of trees near his home and asked of God. He gave this account of his First Vision.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt.&nbsp; It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of 1820.&nbsp; It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God... I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me...When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air.&nbsp; One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other - This is My Beloved Son.&nbsp; Hear Him!"<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>The Lord also appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery after the dedication of the Kirtland Temple<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;and in the 76<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;section of the Doctrine and Covenants Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon record this witness of the resurrected Lord,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father - That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God."<sup>26</sup></p>
<p>In addition to the scriptural accounts of the Lord's resurrection, let me share two other modern witnesses. Lorenzo Snow's granddaughter testified that the prophet spoke to her on one occasion in the Salt Lake Temple and said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It was right here that the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to me at the time of the death of President Woodruff. He instructed me to reorganize the First Presidency of the Church at once and not wait as had been done after the death of the previous presidents, and that I was to succeed President Woodruff...He stood right here, about three feet above the floor. It looked as though He stood on a plate of solid gold." She recalled: "Grandpa told me what a glorious personage the Savior is and described His hands, feet, countenance, and beautiful, white robes, all of which were of such a glory of whiteness and brightness that he could hardly gaze upon Him. Then Grandpa came another step nearer and put his right hand on my head and said: "Now, granddaughter, I want you to remember that this is the testimony of your grandfather, that he told you with his own lips that he actually saw the Savior here in the Temple and talked with Him face to face."</p>
<p>When I was a freshman at BYU my roommate and I drove to Salt Lake City to attend the April 1978 General Priesthood session of conference. I can to this day remember where I sat in the Tabernacle and the feelings of reverence and peace that I felt. The most touching moment of the session for me was the very last statement of President Spencer W. Kimball in his concluding talk. I quote as it was recorded in the May 1978&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>&nbsp;magazine: "I know that God lives.&nbsp; I know that Jesus Christ lives," said John Taylor, my predecessor, "for I have seen him."&nbsp; I bear this testimony to you brethren in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."&nbsp;<br /><br />And so we have dozens of testimonies, both ancient and modern, that Jesus Christ rose from the dead and that He lives yet today with a resurrected body of flesh and bones.&nbsp; In many ways the power of the message of the restored gospel lies in the individual testimonies of the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The absolute knowledge that Jesus Christ's resurrection was a literal resurrection from death to life and the sure and certain knowledge that all mankind will likewise resurrect will never be lost from the Earth so long as this testimony burns in your heart and in my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In that spirit I would now like to add my testimony to the others I have referred to this afternoon. I know that Jesus Christ lives. I know that He lives. I testify that He has a glorified body of flesh and bones. I testify that a sure and true and saving and exalting testimony of Him and of His resurrection comes through the restored gospel and in no other way. Relative to our Heavenly Father, Christ was both the firstborn in the Spirit and the only begotten in the Flesh. He was chosen from before the foundations of the Earth to be both the creator and the redeemer. He is our Savior from both spiritual and physical death. I humbly and solemnly testify that He yet bears in His hands and in His feet and in His side the sacred tokens of His infinite and atoning sacrifice and He is therefore the only name given under heaven whereby salvation cometh. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>One of the greatest truths revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith is that man is eternal. Women and men existed before this life and continue to exist after death. In the Pearl of Great Price, the Lord reveals to both Moses and Abraham the vastness of His works with the focal point being "the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;God's children have no beginning and they will have no end. Moreover, he taught Abraham and revealed to the Prophet Joseph that just as life in mortality is divided into stages, so is life in the eternities.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Stages in Eternity</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />There are many phases of life in the eternities. The first stage or estate consists of intelligences that are organized into spirits. The Lord said to Abraham, "... spirits ... have no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end, they shall exist after, for they are ... eternal."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph that "Man was in the beginning with God. Intelligence or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;In the Council in Heaven, Abraham saw the spirits or "intelligences that were organized before the world was," and that he, Abraham, was one of the noble and great ones.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />As the Council proceeded, Abraham and the other spirits were taught that another stage was about to begin for those who proved valiant in the first estate. The second estate, or mortality, is a phase in which spirits are "added upon."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;They receive physical bodies, gain experience in a world of opposites, are tested, receive added intelligence, and, if faithful, receive additional blessings through the ordinances and covenants of the gospel. Just as there was a beginning to mortality, there would be an end. The physical body would deteriorate and die. But even then, death was not the end but a transition. Other phases would follow consisting of time in a spirit world and a resurrection or reuniting of the physical body with the spirit. A final judgment would occur and there would be an assignment to a kingdom of glory based upon one's life and faithfulness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The important blessings in mortality plus much of what happens after is made possible by "an infinite and eternal sacrifice" performed by God's Only Begotten Son.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;The sacrifice overcomes both physical and spiritual death and makes possible further spiritual growth and development.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;As a consequence, the other phases or states that follow add glory and blessings contingent upon one's faithfulness in the second estate.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;All these truths were taught to the ancient patriarchs and prophets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Just as Abraham and Moses were taught about the vastness and purpose of the Lord's work, so Joseph Smith was taught these same truths as he translated the Book of Mormon and as ancient prophets tutored him throughout his life. The revelations recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price indicate that Moroni, Peter, James and John, Moses, Elijah and numerous others taught him the gospel as they bestowed priesthood keys and powers upon him. Joseph was taught the full meaning of the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement. He learned about the earth's purposes and man's relationships to Deity and other mortals. He learned about the courageous steps taken by Adam and Eve to leave the presence of Heavenly Parents and enter a new world where they learned to walk by faith and where opposites tested them. In their fallen state, they and their children sinned, but their sins could be forgiven through Christ's atonement coupled with their faith, repentance and participation in priesthood ordinances.&nbsp;<br /><br />The priesthood with its keys allowed Joseph to administer saving and exalting ordinances and covenants to others. For the faithful, priesthood ordinances are conduits of power that can shape one's nature and give direction to one's life.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The ordinances are the means by which we enter into covenants with the Lord and receive His promises. For example, baptism is the first ordinance. The ordinance and the covenants associated with it are vital to our progress in the eternities. What do we covenant to do and be? What are the promises associated with baptism? Our part of the covenant is that we agree to take the Savior's name upon us and become a witness of God, enter into His Church, be faithful in living His commandments and willingly serve others. In turn, the Lord promises to extend mercy to us, to cleanse us from sin, and to provide more abundant access to the Holy Spirit.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;His promises are extraordinary gifts. The cleansing power, alone, is essential in preparing us to reenter the presence of the Father.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Isaiah, the great prophet, recognized that all of us need cleansing and that the Lord provides the means when he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away ... But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Isaiah recognizes that all of us sin. Our sins, like the wind, divert and take us away. However, if we submit ourselves to the Lord by entering into the ordinances and covenants, we, like clay to the potter, become the work of His hands. He shapes us and turns us from mortals to immortals, from weakness to power, from corruptible to incorruptible beings.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Ezekiel was even more precise in what the Lord would do for us as we enter into covenants and ordinances with Him. The Lord told Ezekiel:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For I will take you from among the heathen, ... Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean ... A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you ... I will save you from all your uncleannesses..."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>Ordinances and covenants play an important role in the Lord fulfilling the promises made to Abraham that "they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; ... and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;It is interesting to note the ways in which we are added upon in mortality and given blessings for the eternities through the ordinances and covenants and especially through the temple.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>For Those Who Keep Their First Estate</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>For those who keep their first estate, the Father promised added blessings. What are they? First, those who were valiant would leave the immediate presence of their spiritual Parents and enter a new world, a mortal world where further development could take place. One of the great blessings of mortality would be the reception of a physical body. Other blessings would include the mental and spiritual development that occurs in the use of agency; the growth in light and truth that results from living by faith; the experience of living in and dealing with the changes that occur in a mortal world; and, most important, the growth inherent in building an earthly family that has eternal potential. Time does not allow a full examination of these added blessings. What follows is a brief discussion of the roles played by the physical body in time and eternity plus the importance of temple ordinances in opening the door to one fully receiving the blessings promised.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The Physical Body - a Prime Blessing of Mortality</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>One might ask the question: "Why a physical body?" In some religions only the spirit is immortal. In some religions only the spirit is good. For some, they look forward to the day when the body will be shed at death and they will not be encumbered by it. They do not believe in the resurrection as we do. In contrast, we believe the body is a prized possession, that it is critical to our destiny both in this life and in the life to come; and, to the extent that it has imperfections in mortality, it will be perfected in the resurrection. The body performs several essential functions during this life and in the eternities. The first is that it is a home or temple for the spirit.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;It is not only a temple for one's own spirit, but as Paul wrote to the Corinthians: "... your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you...." As part of our soul, it can be tuned to the vibrations of the Holy Spirit and enhance our reception. To do so, it needs to be clean physically and shaped so that it is responsive to the things of the spirit. As an integral part of the soul, the body is a sacred part of us.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Second, the physical body is an instrument of the mind and spirit.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;In a CES Fireside in February 2003, President Boyd K. Packer repeated a portion of his patriarchal blessing in which he was told that he should cherish his physical body, that he should "Guard and protect it - take nothing into it that shall harm the organs thereof because it is sacred. It is the instrument of your mind and the foundation of your character." The body is an instrument that increases the power of the spirit if used properly. As the Prophet Joseph Smith said, "All beings who have bodies have power over those who have not."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;It allows the mind to experience this physical world in a manner not possible without it. The body has the potential of increasing one's capacity to love, to feel emotion, to extend kindnesses, to serve others. In a revelation given to Joseph F. Smith, the sixth prophet of this dispensation, it states that in the next phase of our lives, the spirit world, we will look "upon the long absence of [our] spirits from [our] bodies as a bondage."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;In other words, there are things that we will not be able to do because we do not have a body and we will yearn for the resurrection.&nbsp;<br /><br />Third, physical objects hold light. The earth holds light. Our physical bodies are receptacles of light. The body increases one's capacity to hold light. The 88<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;section of the Doctrine and Covenants teaches that if a person strives to live by celestial laws in this life, their physical bodies will be quickened by a portion of celestial light and, in the resurrection, will "receive of the same, even a fulness."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Many years ago, I learned that one of the roles of the Holy Ghost is to literally add light to our being. At the time, our family lived in England. While there, the branch we were attending received permission to build a new chapel. While we were pouring the foundation, I noticed a man across the street come out of his home, sit on his brick wall and watch us. He did that for three or four days and then came across the street and enquired as to what we were building. We told him:&nbsp; "A chapel!" He asked if we needed help. We did and he joined us. The first day I saw him, his face was a pallid gray and smoke from cigarettes had cast a film on his skin and eyes. It was not long before he invited the missionaries into his home and he joined the Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />Eighteen months later the building was complete and we gathered for the dedication. It was a sacrament meeting and he was a priest at the sacrament table. As I looked at him, I noticed a ruddiness in his complexion that had not been there the first time I met him and his face glowed. He was a different person. The Holy Spirit had entered his being and the light within shone in his countenance. The experience taught me that the body is a receptacle of light, that it has the capacity to hold light and truth.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, the physical body has the power to create life. One of the great purposes of mortality is the opportunity to marry and have children. The family is the basic unit of eternity. We were part of a family before we came here. The design for this earth is for children to enter the world in a family with caring parents to guide them until they reach a level of maturity and can stand on their own.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The Role of Temple Ordinances and Covenants in Fulfilling the Lord's Promises</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Just as the physical body is key to our development on earth, so are the ordinances and covenants of the gospel. As stated earlier, ordinances and covenants are the means by which the Lord extends key blessings. All ordinances are important and critical to life's mission and there is an order to them. Each builds upon the previous one with the first being baptism. The Gift of the Holy Ghost follows and access to the Spirit is dependent on acceptance of the baptismal covenants and the cleansing that takes place. Priesthood with its unique power to serve others follows the Gift of the Holy Ghost. Although it is possible to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood without having had the preparatory or Aaronic Priesthood, the normal path for a young man is to serve in the Aaronic Priesthood from age 12 to his late teens or early twenties, and then receive the Melchizedek Priesthood. Finally, one qualifies for temple ordinances after reaching a reasonable level of spiritual maturity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Temple ordinances are also ordered. For the deceased, the ordinances begin with baptism and the Gift of the Holy Ghost. For the living, temple ordinances begin with the endowment. The endowment consists of a set of initiatory ceremonies followed by the main part of the ordinance where instruction is given and covenants are made. The capstone ceremony is the sealing ordinance that binds a man and woman together for the eternities and provides the foundation for an eternal family.&nbsp;<br /><br />While serving as president of the Provo Temple, it dawned on me that just as the first ordinance of the gospel is a washing, so is the first temple ordinance. The Lord taught Nicodemus that he must be baptized in order to receive salvation in the Kingdom of God.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Exaltation also requires a washing ordinance in order to gain entrance to the highest part of the Celestial Kingdom. Repentance and cleanliness are integral parts of one's spiritual development.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Temple ordinances also increase the commitment level as well as the blessings promised. For example, the ordinance of baptism outside the temple cleanses and provides access to the Holy Ghost. The temple washing and anointing not only cleanses and provides increased sensitivity to the Holy Spirit, but also provides a blessing of health and makes additional promises with respect to one's spiritual growth.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When the priesthood is conferred upon men, they enter into an oath and covenant wherein they commit to magnify the priesthood by the way they live and the manner in which they serve. In the temple, the commitment level is increased and priesthood power is enhanced.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Outside the temple, one is taught to sacrifice one's time in service to others and build the kingdom through the payment of tithes and offerings. Temple covenants raise the level of commitment from sacrifice to consecration. One's attitude changes from giving up something to making sacred those things the Lord has given us and returning whatever the Lord needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Marriage outside the temple is for time only. Marriage in the temple is for time and eternity. The temple ordinance creates a sacred bond between the man and woman and between them and the Lord. It increases and extends their commitment level to each other.&nbsp; In turn, the promises to the couple in the temple sealing are unparalleled. They apply to both mortality and the estates that follow. Not only are promises made to the man and woman but also to their posterity. The sealing makes possible an eternal family and eternal lives.<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;These promises bind parents to each other and to their children forever and ever.&nbsp;<br /><br />A little over a year ago while serving as temple president, I received a letter from a sister that illustrates the promises the Lord makes in the sealing ceremony. The letter told of a blessing she and her family had received through the temple ordinances. The letter told the following story:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Three years earlier, the family had sent one of their younger sons on a mission. He had an early birthday so he did not attend college before leaving. He was a wonderful young man who served faithfully in one of the South African missions. After serving two years, he returned home just before Christmas in 2008. In early January 2009, he left home for his first of class at the local university. The roads were icy and suddenly a car behind him lost control, smashed into the rear of his vehicle and propelled him across the median into the path of an oncoming semi-truck. There was a head-on crash and he was killed instantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A few days later, the parents were at the mortuary dressing their son in his temple clothing in preparation for the burial. While doing so, the mother and father had a feeling that they should gather their family at the temple. After leaving the mortuary, they called their endowed children and invited them to attend the temple that evening. As the family entered the temple, the father felt that they should do a sealing session as a family. They dressed appropriately, went to the sealing office and were assigned to a particular session.&nbsp;<br /><br />During the session, the sealer suggested a short break and asked those in the room, "What brought you to the temple today and why did you choose to do sealings?" When it was the family's turn, the father explained what had happened and how he and his wife had felt the need to gather the family at the temple. The father explained the impression to do sealings as he entered the temple. When the father finished there was one more person in the room to respond. The man indicated that he and his wife had come to do initiatories. When he entered the locker room, a strong feeling came to him that he should do sealings. Consequently, he had come to the sealing office where he was assigned to the same session as the family.&nbsp;<br /><br />He then said, "My wife and I lost a son in a terrible car accident a few years ago. I understand the deep loss and the grief that the family is feeling. I can also assure them that the Lord will heal their grief in time and they will come to know that the son is fine." The sister writing the letter then wrote: "We all felt the Spirit witness that it was not a coincidence that he was with us and some tender healing began to take place. We were reminded that others have experienced similar heartaches and that our grief will be temporary. The man also knew why he had been prompted to be there to offer encouragement and example."&nbsp;<br /><br />The letter continued. "Yesterday (early January 2010), we attended the temple to begin our day of remembering our son. He has now been gone for one year. We came with the intention of doing an endowment session, but upon entering the temple again felt directed to do sealings." She then stated that during the early part of the session, other couples were invited to the altar to do sealings for daughters to parents. When it was this couple's turn to go to the altar, the sealer coordinator came into the room with a new batch of names and indicated they would now begin sealing sons to parents. As the father and mother knelt at the altar, the sealer reviewed the new names and said, "These names are from South Africa." The mother then wrote: "We felt our son close by with a big smile on his face. I will remember that experience forever. It felt so good." The mother and father knew the son was busy doing missionary work on the other side of the veil. He was still involved with those he had learned to love on his mission. For a moment the veil was lifted and the parents and son rejoiced as they received a confirmation of the eternal bonds between them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, there is power in the temple ordinances. I testify that the temple is the place where the Lord fulfills many of the promises made in that pre-mortal council. The scriptures indicate that in the temple one receives a fulness of the Holy Ghost, a fulness of priesthood and a fulness of glory.<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;As promised by the Lord in the pre-mortal council, the earth was organized in order for all of us to be added upon. That began with the reception of an earthly body that has become part of our soul and is essential to our eternal progress. In addition, the temple is the place on earth where the faithful are added upon forever and ever. May you order your lives so that these wonderful blessings will be yours is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a significant privilege to be in Rexburg. It is one of those communities where I feel something very special-something unique and edifying-each time I come. That feeling is certainly due to having a temple, a House of the Lord, high on a hill as a beacon of righteousness. It is also reflective of the large number of righteous Saints who live here. But it is also in large measure because of you, the remarkable students and faculty of BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>As we travel around the Church, we meet many who are connected to this school. We meet full-time missionaries who attended BYU-Idaho before their mission and will return. We meet current students who are in study programs or internships. We meet graduates who are attending graduate school or who are in their careers. We meet parents of current, prospective and former students. This university, housed in this small community, is immeasurably blessing many lives and indeed is a significant asset to the important work of the Church throughout the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have an ongoing and treasured association with your university president, President Kim B. Clark. Ecclesiastically, I work with him as Elder Clark. He serves as an Area Seventy in the Idaho Area, for which I have some responsibility on behalf of the Presidency of the Seventy. Regularly, we communicate about his responsibilities. I observe his spirituality, his wisdom, his devotion, and his care for the leaders and members of the Church. We are blessed to have him, and his dear Sue, as Latter-day Saints, as leaders in the Church, and at the helm of this university.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we gather in a meeting of the Church, like this one, we all have an important duty. Most may assume that I have the greatest responsibility; to give a talk that is informative and interesting, even entertaining. I fully accept my role and have prayerfully prepared; however, I share the success of this meeting with each of you. Some may leave inspired; others not. It really is your choice. You see, the true teacher today is the Holy Spirit. And each of us has access to the inspiration and revelation that can come to us directly, unfiltered by a speaker. All have different needs and circumstances, and the Spirit can effectively communicate with each of us.&nbsp; Consequently, many different messages may be heard today. That is as it should be.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Doctrine and Covenants states (and this was given by way of commandment) "that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act...upon the points of my law."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In the next verse it says "And thus ye shall...be sanctified by that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;We share the responsibility to instruct and be edified; but, the duty to act is ours, individually. And that is the key! When we participate with the intention to act (to improve), the Spirit has full access to our hearts and minds. "And it shall come to pass, that inasmuch as they...exercise faith in me" (remember faith is a principle of action and of power) "I will pour out my Spirit upon them in the day that they assemble themselves together."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;That is my hope for this meeting.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today, I wish to speak of a subject of extraordinary importance. It has to do with things that matter most.&nbsp; In the 84<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;section of the Doctrine and Covenants we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And the greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God. Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest. And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>In a document produced by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1995, slightly modified in 2009, and now contained within the new Church handbook, it is stated that the purpose of Church leadership is to "encourage every member to receive all essential priesthood ordinances, keep the associated covenants, and qualify for exaltation and eternal life."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Another section of the handbook says,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In fulfilling its purpose to help individuals and families qualify for exaltation, the Church focuses on divinely appointed responsibilities.&nbsp; These include helping members live the gospel of Jesus Christ, gathering Israel through missionary work, caring for the poor and needy, and enabling the salvation of the dead by building temples and performing vicarious ordinances."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Everything we do, in one way or another, should be supportive to this purpose.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we understand and believe the doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the role of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in helping us achieve the glorious plan of God, then our priorities become clearer. However, we must relentlessly study the doctrine and exercise faith in the Savior as we live in a world that can cause us to forget who we really are. In our society, there are prominent voices that say money is of greatest worth, or position is of most value, or pleasure is our primary objective. Subtly or boldly, these voices are all around us and can be influential and effective.&nbsp;<br /><br />But, we are not left in confusion as to what is most important, because (again) "in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Today, I speak of those ordinances, and especially of covenants and of their power to elevate our lives above a merely temporal existence. I speak of these covenants as foundational and essential.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ordinances are sacred ceremonies in which we make covenants. Covenants are commitments, promises we make with God. In order to connect us with heaven, and help us overcome the confusion of the mortal world, ordinances raise our view, providing a vision of the things of eternity. Baptism (in which we are born again, spiritually, and take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ), the confirmation (in which we become a member of the Savior's Church and receive the incomparable Gift of the Holy Ghost), conferral of the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood (whereby we obtain God's holy power and promise to magnify our calling), the endowment (wherein we are given a gift of divine understanding), and the sealing (under which we are connected to our families in an eternal model); collectively bestow on us what is needed to fulfill God's plan. The covenants made in these ordinances are part of what the scriptures call "the new and everlasting covenant."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The new and everlasting covenant is the gospel of Jesus Christ. It comprises all the covenants that God makes with man. The keeping of these covenants will allow us eternal life-"which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Most in this congregation have received some of these ordinances; many of you have received them all. Each of us should earnestly work for all of them. Remember, they are essential for us to accomplish our eternal goal. However, they do not simply comprise a checklist so we can say "Done!" Covenants make the ordinances forever relevant in our lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />With all respect to the beautiful facilities of this university, the supreme jewel of this community is the temple, because this is the place where the highest of ordinances are performed. A magnificent blessing was bestowed when the Rexburg Idaho Temple was dedicated on February 10, 2008. Some may have questioned the wisdom of building a temple so close to the existing Idaho Falls Idaho Temple. The impressive volume of work performed within the Rexburg Temple has answered any such question.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was born in Hawaii. At that time (and I am not that old) there were eight temples in the Church, one of which was located on the north shore of the island of Oahu, in Laie. First known as the Hawaii Temple and now named the Laie Hawaii Temple, it was (appropriately) dedicated on Thanksgiving Day 1919. It was the first temple (save Kirtland and Nauvoo) constructed outside the state of Utah and was the fifth in the Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />In anticipation of building that temple, Sister Ruth M. Fox wrote a poem and a melody was composed by Elder Orson Clark. This sweet anthem went:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Sound forth your strains of gladness, ye islands of the sea,And lift your hearts in praises, O Saints of Hawaii;The Lord hath heard your pleadings, your long sought day is hereWhen to the great Jehovah a temple you shall rear.A temple, a temple, in Hawaii!Foreshadowing the glories and splendors yet to be."</p>
<p>I grew up hearing stories of members of the Church from Japan and other countries of Asia who would sell everything they owned to travel to the temple in Hawaii. In my youth, it impressed upon me that the temple must be a place of monumental importance, and going there was worth great sacrifice.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sister Hallstrom and I have served seven years in greater Asia, three in northern Asia in the countries of Japan and Korea. There we met many of the early converts who were endowed and sealed in the Hawaii Temple. Now, many decades later, it is evident that their spiritual stature was mightily influenced by their willingness to do whatever was required to go to the temple when they were young.&nbsp;<br /><br />We served four of those years in the countries of developing Asia. It is interesting and sobering to note that the Hong Kong China Temple serves an area comprising one-half of the world's population. Latter-day Saints from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and many other countries sacrifice greatly for the blessings of the temple. For example, faithful members from Mongolia travel by train for three days, one way, through China, to get to the temple. Imagine, a roundtrip of nearly a week compared to a walk or drive to the temple for most here today of minutes.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Rexburg Temple and the 133 others currently completed in the world, represent our eternal potential and help us see things "as they really are, and of things as they really will be."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Through sacred ordinances, and the keeping of everlasting covenants, a person can maintain a true perspective and ultimately can receive his "Father's kingdom" and all that the Father "hath shall be given unto him."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Forty-two years ago, I went to the temple in Laie, Hawaii, and received the holy endowment. I remember the power and protection I felt as covenants were made, as if it were yesterday. That experience changed me. It elevated my understanding of the priesthood that I held. It guided me as a full-time missionary. It directed the kind of wife I would seek. It provided perspective of the life I desired. Over the ensuing four decades, seeking to keep those covenants has made all the difference in my life, in my marriage and in our family. Covenants are our guide, our "iron rod," our never-changing standard.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now another temple in Idaho has been announced (the fifth in this state), making the total number of temples in operation, under construction, or announced at 160. Rejoicing occurs throughout the Church when another temple is completed. It is a sign of progress in the kingdom of God; the stone that was "cut out without hands...that...became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The generosity of the Lord in providing temples, relatively accessible to the great majority of Church members, needs to make a difference in us. We need to become more reverent, more faith-filled, more refined in spiritual matters. Many of us need to become more focused on the ordinances and the covenants and to use the temple as a centerpiece in this essential process.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the identifying characteristics of the Lord's people is that they are covenant-making and covenant-keeping. A revelation given to Brigham Young in January of 1847 at Winter Quarters states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The Word and Will of the Lord concerning the Camp of Israel in their journeyings to the West: Let all the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and those who journey with them, be organized into companies, with a covenant and promise to keep all the commandments and statutes of the Lord our God...And this shall be our covenant-that we will walk in all the ordinances of the Lord."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Are you a covenant keeper? Are you living your life by covenant, or simply by convenience? Are your covenants the basis for your decisions and the direction of your life?&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes, when we are young, or young in the gospel, we view the keeping of covenants as difficult, maybe too difficult. We wonder, "Isn't there an easier way?" There is not an easy way and as we understand the masterful plan of God we do not seek one. Living by covenant is the way we mature in gaining the attributes of Godliness.&nbsp;<br /><br />During our spiritual development, there is a significant point we can reach when we recognize that our covenants are a blessing, not a burden. This brings great peace, even in difficult times. It also provides protection. It is common for us to pray for physical safety. In a dangerous world, that prayer makes sense and certainly is appropriate. However, I have come to even more fervently pray for something else-I pray continually for the strength to live true to my covenants. This provides spiritual protection. We should live wisely in protecting ourselves from physical harm; but, in reality, whether we live a long or short life upon this earth is of little consequence in the eternities. What really matters is how we live. Living the life of a covenant keeper is of highest value, as that is the only way for us to fulfill our eternal purpose.&nbsp;<br /><br />On this very day, a renewed promise can be made by each of us to be true to the sacred covenants -indeed, to live a covenant life.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have been speaking about eternal covenants, but please understand that the keeping of earthly covenants leads us to the keeping of eternal covenants. For example, you made promises when you decided to attend this university. These commitments may appear demanding and restrictive to those who attend most other institutions of higher learning. They deal with moral conduct, honesty and even dress and grooming. The Honor Code is wholly consistent with the covenants made in the ordinances and simply should be accepted and fully obeyed. Indeed, the atmosphere provided by an academic community with such high standards is an ideal setting for learning to keep promises. If you have not already done so, establish the pattern of a covenant keeper, now. It will bless you in your education, in your profession, in your Church service, in your marriage and as a parent, and in your relationship with God.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me tell you of a man Diane and I met in a small village outside of Hyderabad, India, in 2006. This man lived by covenant. Appa Rao Nulu was born crippled. His society taught him that his potential was severely limited. Likely, he could only become a beggar in the streets. However, as a teenager he met missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They taught him of a greater potential, both in this life and in the eternity to come. He was baptized and confirmed a member of the Church. With significantly raised vision, he set a goal to become an elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood and a full-time missionary. In 1987, he was ordained an elder and called to serve in India, which was then part of the Singapore Mission. Walking was not easy. He did his best using a cane in each hand and fell often, but quitting was never an option. He made a commitment (a covenant) to honorably and devotedly serve a mission, and he did.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we met Brother Nulu, nearly 20 years after his mission, he cheerfully greeted us where the road ended and led us down an uneven dirt path to the one-room home he shared with his wife and three children. It was a very hot and uncomfortable day, about 110 degrees Fahrenheit. He still walked with great difficulty, but there was no self-pity. Through personal diligence, he has become a teacher, providing schooling for the village children. When we entered his modest house, he anxiously took me to a corner and pulled out a box that contained his most important possessions. He wanted me to see a piece of paper. It read "With good wishes and blessings to Elder Nulu, a courageous and happy missionary; June 25, 1987; Boyd K. Packer." On that occasion when then-Elder Packer was visiting India and speaking to a group of missionaries, he affirmed to Elder Nulu his potential. In essence, what Brother Nulu was doing was telling me he was living true to his covenants.&nbsp;<br /><br />On this visit to the Nulu home, we were accompanied by the mission president. He was there to interview Brother Nulu, his wife and his children; for the parents to receive their endowments and be sealed, and for the children to be sealed to their parents. We also were able to present them with the financial arrangements for them to travel to the Hong Kong Temple for these ordinances, a gift made possible by generous members of the Church. They wept with joy as their long awaited dream was to be realized.&nbsp;<br /><br />Weeks later, they arrived in Hong Kong; it was the first airplane ride that any member of the family had ever taken. Their excitement quickly turned to disappointment when immigration officials would not let them enter Hong Kong. Although they had secured visas, a judgment was made by these officials that this family may not return to India. After six hours of being held in a secured room at the airport and repeatedly being told they could not stay in Hong Kong and that they would immediately be sent back to their home country, the Nulus' prayers were answered. An official finally called our Church headquarters in Hong Kong and verified the purpose of the family's trip and a guarantee was made that they would return to India. They were allowed into Hong Kong based on the goodwill the Church had established. Imagine the emotion of working so hard to reach a goal and then to have it seemingly denied, only then to have it granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />With that backdrop, the next day the Nulus entered the temple. In the Lord's divine management, Diane (the only person they knew in Hong Kong besides me) was working in the temple that day. When Sister Nulu unexpectedly saw Diane, she tightly embraced her and sobbed with joy. Diane was able to serve as Sister Nulu's escort during the endowment and she observed the sealing of this faithful couple and then the children to their parents. Their happiness was unspeakable. This represented an accomplishment of deep and abiding significance.&nbsp;<br /><br />The premier example of a covenant life is the Savior, Jesus Christ. When Heavenly Father's glorious plan was presented and there was need for a Redeemer, Jehovah's covenant-making response was "Here am I, send me."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Understanding the plan, He said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.&nbsp; And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon...and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads forever and ever."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>As a model, Jesus was baptized and taught us the importance of ordinances. "Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>In His most exemplary act, the Atonement required Jesus to descend "below all things"<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;and suffer "the pains of all men."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;During this incomprehensible experience, He pled to "remove this cup."<sup>19</sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2011_05_10_Hallstrom.htm#_edn19" target="_self"></a>&nbsp;However, honoring His covenant with the Father motivated the profound statement "nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Men on earth hold the holy apostolic authority, with the inherent keys of the priesthood. This allows that which occurs in the ordinances to having everlasting effect.As the Lord directed Nephi, the son of Helaman, "Behold, I give unto you power, that whatsoever ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Dear brothers and sisters, your presence at this devotional this day is a sign of faith. We thank you. We respect you. We love you. But, for some, perhaps many of us, where we are, spiritually, is not where we need to be. What does the Lord ask of covenant keepers? "Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The "heart" is symbolic of love and commitment. A "willing mind" suggests our best effort, our finest thinking, and seeking God's wisdom. I ask each of us to consider at least one thing we may have felt about our personal covenants in this meeting today and to act upon it. If every one of us improves in some (even modest) way, this meeting will have accomplished its sacred purpose.&nbsp;<br /><br />A final word to you young students married or yet to be: your commitment to a covenant life is of monumental importance. Not just to you, but to your generations that will follow. Firmly establishing your relationship with God will be the supreme legacy you can provide your posterity; and now is the time!&nbsp;<br /><br />On this devotional occasion, I bear witness of these "plain and precious parts of the gospel"<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former Member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p>Bio not available. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sister Oaks and I are delighted to be back on campus with you here at BYU-Idaho. Your conference center is a grand new addition since we were last here. I know of no campus in the country which is blessed with a facility comparable to this one. I pray that I might do it justice with my comments this afternoon.</p>
<p>As we drove onto your campus this morning I felt sheltered and protected, as though we had entered a safe haven from the major cares of the world. Yesterday we left the safe haven of our home in our cul de sac in North Salt Lake. I appreciate safe havens since there seem to be fewer and fewer safe spots in the world today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Recently, as I was discussing with a friend the state of turmoil of the world, I commented that I do not think the world has been in such disarray as it is today, since the close of World War II. This tension is highlighted by such events as the nuclear uncertainty in Japan, the various painful conflicts in Africa, the political upheavals with accompanying bloodshed in the Middle East, the war in Afghanistan, the increasing tensions with China, the belligerent behavior of North Korea, and all of this under the cloud of a very slow economic recovery from a deep world recession.&nbsp;<br /><br />Given this backdrop, a fainthearted person could find fear creeping into their heart. But the gospel of Jesus Christ is not a gospel of fear, but rather a gospel of joy, peace and of hope. In fact, we are told very clearly in section 38 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 30, "...if ye are prepared ye shall not fear." This is a marvelous promise that is often quoted by the Brethren as they seek to help us shield ourselves from the forces of evil threatening us today.&nbsp;<br /><br />As Latter-day Saints we are so fortunate to have the great truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ restored and available for us to use as a foundation for our faith and for our hope in the future. Each day in our prayers we should give thanks to our loving Father in Heaven for the restoration of these grand truths that were lost to mankind and that are now restored.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, we understand that we are His literal, spiritual offspring with the potential to, through the atonement of Jesus Christ and the great plan of happiness, gain a physical body, grow in faith and obedience and return to His side and dwell eternally with Him as celestial beings in an eternal family state. He has promised us all that He has, and that we even have the potential to become like Him. These are all latter-day revealed truths that were previously lost. These truths, along with many others, give purpose and direction to our lives and comfort to our souls. They let us understand who we are in God's plan, what his plan is and how much He loves each of His children.&nbsp;<br /><br />But let's circle back to preparation. How can we prepare ourselves that we need not fear, given this tumultuous world in which we live? We could discuss many facets of the gospel as useful preparations to suppress our fear. But I would like to focus on a particular passage of scripture that I think has a special power of preparation. It is found in the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 45 and 46. You all know it well, but let me read it once more to you:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever."</p>
<p>Let's start this discussion of preparation addressing the promises prominent in this glorious latter-day scripture. First promise: "thy confidence shall wax strong in the presence of God." To me this means simply, we shall stand comfortably before Christ on the day of our personal judgment. This is the day described in 3 Nephi 27:14, "...that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil." What a marvelous blessing, to be comfortable while standing at the judgment bar of Christ!&nbsp;<br /><br />Second promise: "...the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven." This is a blessing of similar import, but not so readily understood. In fact, I sought for several years to understand the term, "the doctrine of the priesthood." Googling it does not yield much useful instruction. But eventually a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught me that this is simply another term used to describe the gospel of Jesus Christ. I was making the question too difficult. The doctrine of the priesthood of God would cover all truth, and the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fullness is built on the foundation of the most important of these eternal truths. Is this an exhilarating promise, to have these eternal truths settle upon us and be understood by our mind and by our soul? I certainly think so.&nbsp;<br /><br />Third promise: "The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion." What an exhilarating promise this is! We do not have time this afternoon to discuss in detail all of the workings of the Holy Ghost, but they are breathtaking. When you can find a few minutes in your schedule take out your copy of&nbsp;<em>Preach My Gospel</em>, turn to the table on pages 96 and 97 and review the summary statements of the listed scriptures regarding the Holy Ghost. I will not read them all, but here are a few of my favorites:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Wouldn't you like to have a constant companion with these powers? He is available to each of us, a gift given at the time of our confirmation as a member of the Church. With the Holy Ghost at our side I cannot imagine any cause to ever fear. If you would like to understand more about this powerful member of the Godhead, study each of the scriptures on this&nbsp;<em>Preach My Gospel</em>&nbsp;chart over the course of a month. If you do, you will come to treasure even more the promised reward of this special companionship.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fourth promise: "thy scepter (shall be) an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth." A scepter is a ceremonial staff signifying power and authority. To me, this promised token means that the godly eternal traits of righteousness and truth will accompany our every act and thought. You will be prepared, and all will know you are prepared.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fifth promise: "thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever." In a world of the tumultuous, the transitory, and the temporary don't the words, "everlasting, forever and ever" have a sweet ring when one is seeking to be prepared and free from fear? I certainly think so.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, let's go back and see how we might bring these grand blessings of preparation and promise into our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As we read earlier, the 45th verse of the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants admonishes us to, "Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly." In so stating it ties two core values of the gospel of Jesus Christ together to culminate in the promised blessings we have discussed. These core values, charity and virtue, are certainly worthy of our serious discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Charity, or the pure love of Christ, is very clearly described and defined in both Moroni 7:45 and in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. A careful reading of these scriptures leads one to the conclusion that the basic elements of charity are patience, kindness, selflessness, purity in thought and to be filled with faith and hope.&nbsp;<br /><br />A description of virtue is a bit more elusive. The word is not found in the Bible Dictionary, and the definition in Webster's Dictionary is very general, focusing on moral excellence, righteousness and goodness.&nbsp;<br /><br />From all of this, I am confident that if we will strive each day, each hour to have our thoughts garnished with sweet tokens of love for the Lord and for our fellow beings we will be prepared to stand confidently before the Him on our day of judgment, and to receive all of the previously discussed promised blessings. To me, the most obvious of these tokens that we have time to discuss this afternoon are: kindness, selflessness, forgiveness, faith, and purity. We will discuss each of them in some detail.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is important that we do not make it sound easy. In fact, I think this is the most difficult of all the commandments in the gospel, to govern our minds unceasingly. Obviously, we will not reach this lofty goal overnight, no matter how dedicated we are, but we should not let that discourage us. This level of mind-management and discipline should be our lifelong goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In 3 Nephi 27:27, Christ advises: "What manner of men ought ye to be, even as I am." He is our perfect exemplar. In pursuit of this very high standard, we are often advised to consider, in particular situations, "What would Christ do?" I have found that to be a very useful pattern of thinking. Similarly, I believe it would be useful to ask ourselves, "What would Christ think?" There is no question in my mind but that virtue garnishes the Savior's mind unceasingly. We should be so inclined and so impelled.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, given all of this, how do we lift ourselves up toward this most lofty goal and prepare ourselves that we have no need to fear? &nbsp;Let's start with kindness. Kindness embraces gentleness, thoughtfulness, tenderness, and compassion in our treatment of our fellow beings. Christ gave us a superb practical yardstick for measuring our treatment of others in the 10th chapter of Luke, verses 25-37, as he taught the lawyer inquiring as to how he might inherit eternal life, "love thy neighbor as thyself," and then went on, through the parable of the Good Samaritan, to instruct us all on His broad definition of who is "our neighbor."&nbsp;<br /><br />This parable is so very instructive, as it tells how the Samaritan gave not only of his substance but also of his time as he bound up the injured man's wounds, took him to an inn and provided for his extended care. Although not recorded in Luke it is reasonable to assume that the Samaritan, by tarrying on the road to Jericho, was significantly increasing his own exposure to the marauding thieves. Of all of the stories that I have ever heard, scriptural or historical, this oft repeated parable explains best the broad limits of Christian compassion and kindness.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Isaiah 63:7, the Lord's loving-kindness is discussed, highlighting the obvious truth that in the Lord's calculus and character, love and kindness go hand in hand to describe His very being.&nbsp; Thus, we are admonished in 2 Peter 1:7 to add, "to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity." Truly, if we can "garnish our thoughts unceasingly" with kindness we will have added significantly to our fear fighting preparations.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moving to selflessness, again we can profitably look to the example of Christ for our most powerful instruction. Looking through all of the records of his life, I can find no instance of Him spending any of His time worrying about His perks and His privileges. Rather, He was always engaged in teaching and healing, and, ultimately He was focused on atoning for the sins of all mankind. This atonement stands as the greatest act of loving selflessness in the history of the earth. But this is not surprising; every detail of Christ's life underlines His absolute selflessness accompanying His love.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I look at my many associations with various people over the course of my life, I find that the most influential souls are those whose actions were characterized, and even driven by their concern for others and their corresponding lack of concern for themselves. Of course none of them rivaled Christ in this dimension, but many were very influential. My parents are at the top of my list, along with my wife and my other family members. They are followed by priesthood leaders, select teachers, and special friends and neighbors. I have two neighbors who stand as great examples of selflessness. For the past several years whenever I arise to find snow in my yard I look to my walks and driveway and find the snow has been removed. They generally remove my snow before they do their own. It may seem like a small thing, but to me this has been a great demonstration of selflessness. True selflessness encompasses elements of love, humility, and service, and when used liberally as a garnish for our thoughts, it will be a vital part of our preparations against fear.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moving on, it is impossible to overstate the importance of forgiveness as we list the appropriate garnishments for our thoughts. Christ gave this choice virtue great emphasis as He taught us in the Lord's Prayer, saying, "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors." This is a clear indication to us that we cannot expect to be blessed with the Lord's tender mercy of forgiveness if we cannot find it in our hearts to be forgiving.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Gordon B. Hinckley often talked about the core value of forgiveness, and has provided us with a most powerful statement on the subject. Please let me read it for your consideration and instruction.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I think [forgiveness] may be the greatest virtue on earth, and certainly the most needed.&nbsp; There is so much of meanness and abuse, of intolerance and hatred. There is so great a need for repentance and forgiveness. It is the great principle emphasized in all of scripture, both ancient and modern. Somehow forgiveness, with love and tolerance, accomplishes miracles that can happen in no other way."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Putting these two thoughts together we can conclude that our own personal salvation is directly dependent on our ability and willingness to forgive those who have offended us in some small or large way. We can also see, through President Hinckley's eyes, the unending need in the world about us for large measures of repentance on the part of all, and of forgiveness on the part of each of us. If this greatest of virtues is garnishing our thoughts as constantly as we can impose it on our minds our likelihood of being overcome with fear will be dramatically reduced.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is with excitement that I move on to faith as a Christian virtue capable of calming our fears. Fear can flow from uncertainty and danger as well as from sin. We may have uncertainty regarding the future of our family, our employment, our schooling, our government or our society. We can also have intense uncertainty regarding our relationship with God. Many ask, "Is there life after death?" Some even ask, "Is there a God?" And, continuing along this line they logically ask, "If there is a God, what does He expect of me?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Lack of answers to these key questions can certainly prompt deep anxiety and even fear in one's heart. Faith-based confidence that there is "life after death" and that there is "certainly a God" and that we can come to know quite specifically "what He expects of each of us" can dispel this fear. Because of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ we have laid out before us a pattern of truth that will lay a solid foundation for our faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fearful danger can obviously be found in the acts of nature such as tsunamis taking over 200,000 lives in Indonesia and over 20,000 in Japan, earthquakes taking over 200,000 lives in Haiti and Chile, tornados killing scores across the U.S., or thousands upon thousands killed in the political uprisings in Libya, Syria, Iraq, the Ivory Coast, and Yemen, and earlier in Rwanda and Burundi, as well as over 35,000 persons killed along the U.S./Mexican border in the last five years. Institutions collapse, cities disappear, and fortunes fade. And only the most na&iuml;ve would claim that the uncertainty and dangers are finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Add to this picture the pangs of guilt and fear at the prospect of being held accountable for our sinful, disobedient acts of disregarding the laws and commandments of the Lord. These fears and feelings can only be dispelled through our faith in the workings of divine mercy through the atonement of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Onto this muddled stage let faith enter. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, with an accompanying understanding of the Atonement and of the Great Plan of Happiness with its joyous promise of forgiveness through repentance and baptism, can chase away fear like sunlight on the morning frost. Faith in God has a remarkable power to put pain, pressures, and problems into perspective. The promise of reunion with loved ones after death has a remarkable salving effect on one the most poignant causes of anguish in life, the loss of a loved one. When death loses its sting, a great cause of fear fades.&nbsp;<br /><br />Equally important, when one comes to know the Lord and seeks to align their life with gospel principles a peaceful, permanent calm can descend on that life. Indeed, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the assurance of things not seen.&nbsp;<br /><br />If one will let faith be welcome into their everyday thought processes, a major stride will be taken in the preparations necessary to drive out fear.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, purity of thought. One of the greatest degradations of our society is the lapse in standards of morality as reflected in language, music and most entertainment. The unheard of foul and filthy things of the past have become the common place things of today. Attempts to screen and protect our eyes, ears, and minds are, at best, only partially effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To allow our thoughts to be garnished with virtue we must strive constantly to shun and block out the ever-present barrage of unworthy, teasing, and titillating sleazy ideas and images that confront us. Virtue and vulgarity cannot cohabitate in your mind. The vulgar will drive out the virtuous in the click-beat of the mouse. More specifically, the Holy Ghost cannot linger in the presence of these degrading influences we generally label pornography.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"But Elder Oaks," you might say, "How can we avoid it? It is everywhere." Indeed, it seems to be everywhere, but if we expect to partake of those promised blessings we discussed earlier we must learn how to best protect our minds from these thoughts and images. Let me offer some suggestions from my experience, and then you go home and build your own list of rules and guidelines on how you can shield your mind from the fiery darts of filth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several years ago after my retirement from the Air Force we were contemplating buying our first computer. I was concerned because I had heard so much about the pollution that could flow through the computer screen. But it quickly became evident that, absent my aide de camp, my Executive Officer and my secretary, I was going to need some administrative assistance. So we bought a computer, but before we had it installed I put a picture of President Gordon B. Hinckley on the shelf behind my shoulder so he could always see what was on my screen. Now that sounds a bit childish, but it worked. Offensive pop-ups were quickly relegated to the trash bin.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the same vein, set rules regarding all of your entertainment. Do not watch any R-rated movies or others that have the capability to embarrass you or degrade your thinking and your sensitivities. Read the previews and ratings and avoid embarrassing situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me share a sweet, related story. I am currently serving as priest quorum advisor in our ward, and one of our priests related the following: he and a group of his friends had purchased their tickets and were going into a movie. As they were waiting, this young priest texted a friend and asked him to come down to the theater and join the group. His friend texted back that his parents had walked out of that particular movie the evening before and that he was not interested in seeing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our young priest told his friends of this text from his friend, but they did not think it was a problem, and besides, they already had their tickets. Nevertheless, he tore up his ticket and went to work at his nearby place of employment. He understands threats to virtuous thoughts.&nbsp;<br /><br />A very important habit to develop is to choose your friends wisely. In your day-to-day interactions with them they will have a significant impact on your character and attitudes. There is truth in the pickle barrel analogy. Put a cucumber in the pickle barrel long enough and it will become a pickle. Further, there is much truth to the old saw, "You are judged by the company you keep."&nbsp;<br /><br />Unfortunately, you will probably not always be successful in your shielding efforts. But the Lord will help you if you will rely on Him. President Henry B. Eyring relates a very instructive experience regarding the Lord's help. He was in a European city and stepped into a seemingly innocent shop.&nbsp; As soon as he was in the place he knew that he did not belong there, and he turned and walked out. But, for the next couple of days the offensive images on the walls remained in his mind, despite his fervent prayers. Then, finally the Spirit instructed him, that the bubble of his protection had been lifted and that he needed to "pray to be led not into temptation." "To be led not into temptation" should be a regular element of our daily prayers.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you have been sloppy in your habits of mind shielding, now is the time to change your course. Great blessings are in store for all who will seek throughout their lives to constantly improve in their ability to "let virtue garnish their thoughts unceasingly." This pattern can be a foundation for personal spiritual preparation. And we have the Lord's promise that, when we are prepared, the turmoil and threats of the world will not bear down upon us and, indeed, we shall not fear.&nbsp;<br /><br />I leave you my testimony. I know these things are true. I know that the Lord Jesus Christ lives and He guides this Church through a living prophet on a daily basis. The Book of Mormon is the word of God, and can stand as a pillar of strength in our lives. And I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dietetics Faculty Member at BYU</p>
<p>Bio not available. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was invited to give this devotional address in early February. That's when I'm right in the thick of writing letters of recommendation for students. To become registered dietitians, students must complete an accredited post-graduate dietetic internship and take a national registration exam. Internships are very competitive, and while every part of the internship application process is important, the letters of recommendation really do carry weight in the selection process.<br /><br />Anyway, I had written about 20 recommendations at the time I received the invitation. That afternoon I told a colleague I had been asked to give a devotional address in Rexburg and joked, "Maybe I could just read some of my recommendations-they're pretty good!"&nbsp;<br /><br />Though I was kidding, I started thinking about recommendations. We use the term recommend all the time. I recommend this restaurant, he recommends that movie, your doctor recommends that you get more sleep. Of more importance, we seek a temple recommend.&nbsp;<br /><br />As students, all of you probably have sought (or will soon seek) a recommendation from a professor for an internship of some sort, graduate school, a scholarship, or a job. In an average year, I write over 30 recommendations for dietetic internships, five for graduate school, six to eight for scholarships, and I probably respond to at least eight telephone inquiries for job recommendations. Why? Why all those recommendations? Do they really have any influence on the outcome?&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, originating in the 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, the word 'recommend' means "to praise, to present as worthy."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;So when someone requires a recommendation, he or she is assuming two things. One, that the person making the recommendation knows something about the applicant and, two, that the recommender will be honest in the assessment. Thus, if someone is worthy of a positive recommendation, the recipient may be influenced to offer the job, slot, or scholarship to the applicant.&nbsp;<br /><br />Because it's easy for almost anyone to write a lot of glowing remarks about someone, most places specify what areas they want addressed in the letter. Or there may be a rating form in addition to comments. Let me show you what gets assessed in the recommendation for a dietetic internship-virtually all 250 internship programs use this form. The instructions say, "Please rate the applicant on the qualities you feel you can judge on the grid below" and the rating scale is: outstanding, more than satisfactory, satisfactory, needs improvement, or unsatisfactory.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first three items that are assessed have to do with application of knowledge-what the student knows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nutrition Content<br /><br />Medical Nutrition Therapy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Foodservice Management</p>
<p>The final item is also related to the field:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Overall potential as a dietitian</p>
<p>You can mentally change those terms to something related to whatever you're studying to make this recommendation fit your circumstances. Even though this is the list for the dietetic internship, I guarantee that the rest of the items would apply to you regardless of your area of study. That's because all of the rest of the items, 14 of them, address a few skills and a lot of personal characteristics, what the student is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Analytical Skills/Problem Solving</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Conceptual Skills</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Communication Skills- both oral and written</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Interpersonal Skills-with peers/coworkers and with teachers/supervisors</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Leadership Potential</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Initiative/Motivation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Punctuality</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Adaptability</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Reaction to Stress</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Perseverance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Creativity</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Organizational Skills</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Works Independently</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Responsibility/Maturity</p>
<p>Does it surprise you that the recommendation form focuses so little on what students know and so much on what students are? It's practically a given that a college graduate knows something about his or her major. Where the real value of the recommendation comes in is having someone share insights about what the person is like, how he or she interacts with others, how the applicant can apply knowledge.&nbsp;<br /><br />Before I go on, here is my one hint to you about obtaining recommendations from professors-let them get to know you. I don't mean you have to become chums, but if all you do is show up in class and turn in your assignments it's really hard to say anything very meaningful about you. Participate in discussions, ask questions, and drop by the office for clarification when you need it. Help your professor see you as more than a body in the classroom. That will not only be helpful to him or her when writing a recommendation for you; I can almost guarantee you'll enjoy the class more, as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />When completing the internship recommendation form (remember, I'm doing one for at least 30 students a year), I ask myself, "What evidence have I seen that Student X has a high degree of_____?" And then I consider each item. If there is a lot of evidence, I rate the student Outstanding or More than Satisfactory; if not, the rating is lower. Then I can elaborate on or illustrate the student's qualities in the comments section of each form. While many, if not most, of these characteristics are internal, they have to be manifest in behavior, or I can't really assess them. Whether thinking about your spiritual or secular life, actions, the "do," and character, the "be," must be related.&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Lynn G. Robbins addressed the issue of "to be" versus "to do" in his April, 2011 General Conference address. He said:&nbsp;<br /><br />"<em>To be</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>to do</em>&nbsp;are inseparable.&nbsp; As interdependent doctrines they reinforce and promote each other. . . .&nbsp;<em>To do</em>&nbsp;without&nbsp;<em>to be</em>&nbsp;is hypocrisy, or feigning to be what one is not-a pretender. . . . Conversely,&nbsp;<em>to be</em>&nbsp;without&nbsp;<em>to do</em>&nbsp;is void. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Be</em>&nbsp;without&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;really isn't&nbsp;<em>being</em>-it is self-deception, believing oneself to be good merely because one's intentions are good. . . .&nbsp;<em>Do</em>&nbsp;without&nbsp;<em>be</em>-hypocrisy-portrays a false image to others, while&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;without&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;portrays a false image to oneself."<sup>2</sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2011_05_31_Nyland.htm#_edn2" target="_self"></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />The congruence of being and doing is important in obtaining a good recommendation in this life, but it's absolutely critical for obtaining the only recommendation that really matters. As important as the opinion of a professor or work supervisor is relative to receiving a scholarship or award, getting into graduate school, or landing a job, there is one whose opinion matters above all others. Our Savior is our advocate with the Father,<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;and His assessment of us has more value than any earthly opinion or endorsement. Our supreme goal should be to be worthy of this recommendation found in Matthew, ". . . Well done, thou good and faithful servant. . . ."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />While it's possible you could fool a professor or supervisor with lots of "do" and very little "be," there can be no pretense with the Savior-He knows us intimately and understands us completely. If He had a recommendation form, it would probably have only one item: How well did you become like Christ? In order to assess that, the Savior would consider our degree of faith, hope, and charity; He would determine how well we kept the commandments, how diligently we served others, how easily we could be entreated, how we responded to correction and counsel, and how much we focused our attention on Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There are myriad other factors that go into becoming Christ-like, but rather than try to list them all, I'd like to suggest four things that can help us develop the characteristics we need to be worthy of His recommendation. They are closely related to each other and they all happen to start with the letter P. I'll call them the Four Ps.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first P is a Sense of Purpose. To paraphrase the Cheshire Cat: "If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there."<sup>5</sup>Well, not just any road will take us to the Celestial Kingdom. In fact, Nephi says it's a " . . . strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; . . ."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;We have to know where we want to go to get on and stay on the correct path.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the great blessings we have as a result of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that we do know about our eternal nature; we know we are literal spirit children of our Heavenly Father; we know why this earth was created; and we know God's purpose-you can all quote Moses 1:39, "For behold, this is my work and my glory-to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You've probably heard the story about the three bricklayers. When asked what he was doing, the first replied, "I'm laying brick." The observer moved on to the next man and asked the same question. He replied, "I'm earning a living." When asked what he was doing, the third man answered, "I'm building a cathedral to my God." Now, when the weather turned wet and cold or the task became more challenging, which bricklayer do you think continued to do his best? Having a sense of purpose, an accurate sense of purpose, is fundamental to making the best decisions and staying the course, no matter how difficult it becomes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Knowing that we are children of Deity with the divine potential to both assist in His work and glory by committing ourselves to lifting others and to become as He is ought to give us some staying power when the strait and narrow path gets steeper, rockier, and more obscure than we might like. Lack of this knowledge is the source of so much misery in the world. With no sense of who they are and what they can become, many of Father's children make choices to their eternal detriment. They choose the easy but dishonest way to face problems, they fail to forgive, they discount the importance of chastity, and they live for today without really understanding the potential riches of tomorrow. Holding firm to our eternal purpose protects us from such profligacy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Within the broad eternal purpose, we develop a sense of our own purpose as we receive and study our patriarchal blessings. My father was a patriarch in two locations; for about ten years in Kansas City, Missouri, and another ten years in American Fork, Utah. In that time he gave 1167 patriarchal blessings. I had the privilege of transcribing the blessings for about the first year he was a patriarch and then again for the last ten years. One of the many things I learned is how clearly Heavenly Father knows us as individuals. Each blessing contained unique descriptions of gifts, unique cautions, and unique promises. I also learned that if we viewed each other from Heavenly Father's perspective, we'd be slower to judge and quicker to love. We look pretty amazing to our Creator because He's not fooled by earthly barriers to our potential.&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition to finding guidance from our patriarchal blessings, a question we must ask ourselves often is, "How can I best fulfill God's purpose for me?" Answers to that question lead us to gain a sense of our purpose as we faithfully fulfill callings in our wards and stakes, as we pursue schooling, career, and other options that allow us to serve our fellowmen, and as we love and serve those wonderful people called family members.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The next P is the Ability to Plan. Planning is how we affect the future rather than just being affected by it. In order for planning to have any significant meaning, we need to keep our purpose in mind. In fact, the reason for planning is to determine the courses of action that will help us achieve our purpose. Most organizations, whether they are for-profit businesses or not-for-profit entities, have a mission statement--in other words, their purpose. It is stressed at new employee orientations, posted in the lobby, and printed in the annual report. That mission or purpose is expected to stay constant for many years and is intended to guide the choice of activities in which the organization engages. A great deal of time is then spent planning goals and strategies by which the organization can both support its mission and grow and progress for the next several years. That business model can be adapted nicely to our personal model.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was a sophomore in college, Elder Sterling W. Sill was the speaker at a stake conference. He said something that has remained with me and continues to influence me. To the best of my memory, he said, "In nothing does man come closer to God-like activity than in planning." Think about what that means. Think about the nature of divine planning. In Moses 3:5 we learn, "For I, the Lord God, created all things . . . . spiritually before they were naturally upon the face of the earth." I picture that as a form of planning. And don't we refer to our reason for being on the earth as the Plan of Salvation? In Moses 6:62 the Father states, " . . . I say unto you: This is the plan of salvation unto all men, through the blood of mine Only Begotten . . . ."&nbsp;<br /><br />The plans we make for ourselves reflect our use of agency. In the broadest sense, we plan to either keep the commandments or not. We plan to either be righteous or not, to be good or evil. I frankly can't imagine anyone in this room planning to be anything other than a good, righteous, keeper of commandments. Those are broad plans. Our planning then needs to include some specific strategies to help us. Examples of specific plans might be our plans for how and when we study the scriptures, how we plan to organize our study, social, and personal time, how we plan to respond to a particular temptation, and how we plan to incorporate loving acts of service into our lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />You've probably all used a day planner of some sort to help you keep track of your assignments, exams, and other important dates. Some people become so enamored with planning their time that they lose all flexibility. As important as planning is, remember that its purpose is to help you fulfill your purpose. Sometimes plans have to change or be postponed so we can attend to important things we simply didn't plan on. Over-programming gives planning a bad name!&nbsp;<br /><br />One other note about planning: be sure to leave room in your plan for serendipity. Serendipity is finding unexpected things of value. To be honest, I wasn't smart enough to plan for many of the wonderful things that have happened to me in my life. But I did have plans that kept me on the right road and put me in positions to recognize unexpected but good paths to try. If your plans keep you headed in the right direction, it's unlikely that you'll make any big mistakes.&nbsp;<br /><br />A third P is Maintaining Perspective. In a physical sense, you know that how an object appears to you depends on where you are when you look at. One of my favorite natural features in Utah County is Mount Timpanogos. In the winter, my drive home is breathtaking if I happen to leave just when the snow-covered mountain is reflecting the pink of the sunset to the west. Driving in the Heber Valley gives an entirely different, and magnificent, view of Timpanogos from the back (the people in Heber Valley may even think of that as the front!). Timpanogos can be seen from the south end of the Salt Lake Valley sneaking between two other peaks-and it took me a long time to realize it was Mount Timpanogos because it's seen from an end rather than its usual face.&nbsp; Finally, if I'm lucky enough to be flying home from somewhere in the east during daylight, the plane often approaches Salt Lake City from the south, and below me there is Timp, looking entirely different than she does from any other view. Which is the real Mount Timpanogos?&nbsp; Well, of course, they all are-the mountain doesn't change; only my perception does.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />With physical objects, we're pretty comfortable with the idea that something can remain constant while our view changes. We might have an easier time in life if we could apply that same understanding to the non-physical world, to what we perceive emotionally, interpersonally, and spiritually. Compared to how they really are, our problems, challenges, interactions, and even decisions sometimes appear too large or too small to us. This proportion distortion can be dangerous to our spiritual health. It can cause us to become discouraged or angry enough to want to give up our efforts at living righteously or it can cause us to be cavalier about some of our choices and fail to give them proper attention.&nbsp;<br /><br />So we need two kinds of perspective-the short view and the long view. First the short view. A friend of mine penned the following quotation in her calligraphy class. It hung on my office wall for several years, and I think about it often. "Sometimes, when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things, I am tempted to think there are no little things."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />How often do we become discouraged with our progress on something because it seems too slow? How often do we discount the value of some action because it's so small? Let me tell you about what small things did for Gary. Gary, which isn't his real name, was a middle-aged participant in one of the weight management classes we used to offer through our department. We had had our lesson on physical activity, and Gary decided that he really wanted to be fit. So, he bought some jogging shoes and sweatpants and set the date for his jogging debut. His plan was to jog around his block a couple of times for the first few days then increase his distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The day for jogging arrived, and Gary put on his clothes, laced up his shoes, and started out the door. Excited to begin his jaunt around the block, he was quite surprised and distressed to find that about a quarter of the way around the block he was completely winded and couldn't manage another step. So Gary stopped and weighed his options. He could turn around and go back home, but he decided that would be too embarrassing. So he walked the rest of the way around the block to his home. Rather than give up on the whole jogging idea, the next morning Gary decided that he could jog as far as he had the previous day plus one house, then walk home. The next day he added one house more, and the next day one house more. One house! That's nothing! Well, by adding one house a day over many weeks, Gary found himself jogging a couple of miles easily. He felt better than he had in years, and developed an enjoyable and healthy habit. Tremendous consequences come from little things.&nbsp;<br /><br />Please don't think that the only important decisions or actions are the big ones. The Lord doesn't-in Alma 37:6-7 He says, " . . . but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise. And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls."&nbsp;<br /><br />Recognize the power of small decisions and small actions for good or ill. It's the cumulative effect of many little decisions that determines if we are living righteous lives or lives enmeshed in sin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's turn our attention to the long view for a moment. While it's important to recognize that little things have tremendous consequences, it's also important to recognize that some things are smaller than they seem and may even be inconsequential from the eternal perspective. Two statements by Elder Neal A. Maxwell illustrate this point. He said, "If we criticize God or are unduly miffed over sufferings and tribulation, we are really criticizing the Planner for implementing the very plan we once approved, premortally (see Job 38:4, 7). Granted, we don't now remember the actual approval. But not remembering is actually part of the plan!"<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;On another occasion, Elder Maxwell wrote this wonderful little reminder, "Having so very long ago set in motion His plan of salvation, God will not revise the structure or the schedule of this second estate just because you and I have a bad day."<sup>9</sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2011_05_31_Nyland.htm#_edn9" target="_self"></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />With the long view, it's easier to see that Heavenly Father loves us too much to spare us from the very experiences, difficult as they may be, that will develop in us the qualities needed to enter the Celestial Kingdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You've all lived long enough to know that life isn't always easy or fair. You know that sometimes the decisions of others, the fragile nature of a mortal body, and even the forces of nature can cause distress and pain. You know that you will sin and make some mistakes in your life. Viewing all of those with eternal perspective helps with the final P-Perseverance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Perseverance must be important, or we wouldn't have so many scriptures admonishing us to endure to the end. None of them say, "slide to the end" or "sail to the end," so that must mean our Father recognizes that it isn't easy to do all that is required of us. But what a wonderful reward awaits us if we do. It's described in the Doctrine and Covenants this way: "And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I really like Paul's perseverant attitude in Philippians 3:13-14, " . . . but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."&nbsp;<br /><br />How can we "forget those things that are behind?" What's behind might include times we have been wronged, sins of which we have repented, or simply painful experiences. Focusing on any of those can keep us from pressing forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />And how Satan would enjoy helping us fail! In fact, that's his purpose. He would have us believe that people who have wronged us don't deserve our forgiveness and delights when we replay the hurt over and over in our minds. He would have us believe that no matter what we do, we are not worthy of forgiveness when we have sinned. That Heavenly Father can't really love and forgive someone who has done what we have done and that repentance isn't real and isn't enough. He would have us focus on the unfairness of life and question how God can really love us if He lets bad things happen to people who are trying as hard as we are to be good. Those are all lies. Satan would have us remember and replay all that is behind in order to have us forfeit all that lies ahead.&nbsp;<br /><br />And what lies ahead is the focus of what Paul said-we must reach forth and press toward the mark. If we remember our purpose, plan appropriately, and maintain our perspective, our ability to persevere is greatly increased. When we encounter obstacles, they become instructive rather than damning. Our perseverance will lead us to the greatest of all the gifts of God.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, I began today by talking about recommendations. I pointed out that the opinions of others matter as we try to progress in our professional and academic lives. I showed you some of the facets of a typical recommendation form, and noted that even in a secular setting, what we are is more important than what we know. The most important concept we examined today is that of being worthy of the Savior's recommendation-of living a life consistent with His standards and His expectations. In preparation for that final loving and just judgment, perhaps we can perform a self-evaluation from time to time. We can ask ourselves:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How well do I. . .&nbsp;Remember my purpose,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Demonstrate the ability to plan</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Maintain perspective, and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Show perseverance</p>
<p>The Four Ps can help us live our mortal existence in a way that will be pleasing to the Lord and worthy of His commendation. One other thing to remember about the Lord's commendation-He is judging us from a perspective of love and abundance. There may be a finite number of slots in graduate school or the workplace or the scholarship pool. There is no limit to how many worthy souls can enter the Celestial Kingdom. The Savior isn't trying to screen us out; He's trying to draw us in. I testify of the love our Father in Heaven and our Savior have for us, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope in my remarks today we can have something of a conversation. Even though it is I who will do all of the talking, I hope you will do your part by listening and pondering, particularly if you will listen to that familiar voice inside your mind that speaks so clearly in such circumstances.<br /><br />Rather than just prepare a talk for this devotional I have tried to prepare myself to hear and speak under the direction of that same spirit.&nbsp; My hope is that when we leave here today each one of us will know something important and personal that we didn't know or didn't see clearly when we came.&nbsp;<br /><br />In homage to this academic setting I would like to begin our conversation today with a little poetry, and I thought perhaps something about crows might be helpful. About the time you were born an elderly American poet named John Ciardi was saying goodbye to the world. As his life wound down I suspect he may have been thinking about the relevance of a poem he had written years earlier entitled "About Crows." Among other things this poem speaks to you young crows as well as to those of us who qualify as old crows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The old crow is getting slow; the young crow is not.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Of what the young crow does not know, the old crow knows a lot.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At knowing things, the old crow is still the young crow's master.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What does the old crow not know? How to go faster!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The young crow flies above, below, and rings around the slow old crow.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What does the fast young crow not know? Where to go!<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>That's about as deep into poetry as I can manage today. I mentioned that John Ciardi was elderly when he died. He was in fact about my age, so you can see that I too fit into the "elderly" category. I'm one of the old crows, and I suppose one of the hallmarks of age and experience is the not-so-subtle shift from asking "how do I go faster?" to asking "where am I going?" At any rate, for us old crows going faster is not much of an option any more.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Because you will be an old crow a lot longer than you will be a young crow, I thought perhaps I could share with you today an old crow perspective about where the winds of this world are sweeping us, and some of the anchors you can rely on to see you through your journey and help you arrive safely at your true destination. As Yogi Berra said (or should have said) "you can't get where you're not going."&nbsp;<br /><br />With that as a backdrop, let's consider together where we are going and how we will know when we get there. I thought I could approach that today by asking: How can you live a successful life?&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's start our discussion with an example I know best. Few things in my own life have been as elusive as success. Time and again when I thought I had finally found success the definition of that slippery notion evolved once again in my developing heart. Looking back, I can see that my perspective kept changing because the light of God was patiently tutoring me about who I am, why I am here, and where my destiny really lies. That tutoring, by the way, is still going on for me.&nbsp;<br /><br />Growing up in a small Southern Utah town I thought success meant making the team, having good friends, getting good grades, and not getting caught doing stupid things. When I became a teenager success took on new meaning: having fun, being popular, getting a drivers license, getting a date, becoming independent. As a missionary, success seemed to be found only in finding, teaching, and baptizing investigators. By the time I received an undergraduate degree I was not only a new father but also a newly commissioned officer in the U.S. Army and success for me meant surviving an unpopular, violent war in Southeast Asia. When I emerged from graduate school and started to practice law, I was sure success meant finding clients, winning cases, and getting paid. In fact, since entering the workforce it has always been tempting to find success through having more money in the bank, a better house in the burbs, and a newer car in the garage.&nbsp;<br /><br />What is your definition of success today and how will that change over time? Remember, you will be an old crow a lot longer than you will be a young crow. Will the list of things you anticipate contributing to your success include a better job, a bigger house, a newer car, more fashionable clothes, more fun, more toys, an iPad?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the real "a-ha" moments in the evolution of my own feelings on this subject came when I heard my elderly mother reflect that in her life she envied others of only three things: better soil, better education, and a better disposition. That those three things were the stuff of her dreams caused me to think deeply about the value of my own longings.&nbsp;<br /><br />Obviously success means different things to different people, but one thing is clear: those of us who truly desire to be disciples of Jesus Christ must somehow come to understand and embrace His definition of success for us, which seems to be embodied in his words: "Therefore, what manner of men [and women] ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am."&nbsp;<br /><br />In stark contrast to such an exalted expectation, consider how many people are content to merely appear successful--what my Texas friends call "big hat, no cattle." Some folks simply ooze success, but if you look behind the curtain you often see them working hard to conceal personal, family, financial, or even religious lives that are more illusion than substance. Like reality television, their lives are often filled with more drama than direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As you probably already recognize, virtual success is virtually no success at all--especially in the context of being a disciple of Jesus Christ. Appearance, like attendance, is not the key indicator of discipleship. To be a disciple means to be a participant not just a spectator.&nbsp; The imperative for a disciple is to "come to Christ" not just "come to Church." As prophets today describe it, the Church must be in our lives but the gospel must also be in our hearts. For all of us, young and old, it is not enough to simply have a testimony, to feel and know, for that is only a beginning. We become true disciples only when we are doing and becoming, something we call conversion. And in the end even doing is not enough. It is only when we become like him that his grace is sufficient for us to be truly successful. Helping us become like Him is our Father's work and what our Savior paid such a dear price for.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As missionaries learn through their study of&nbsp;<em>Preach My Gospel</em>: "Our Father's plan for us to be successful in this life and to return to live with Him is called the gospel of Jesus Christ, with Jesus' Atonement at the center of that plan."<sup>2</sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2011_06_07_Snow.htm#_edn2" target="_self"></a>&nbsp;I find that explanation to be profoundly helpful.&nbsp; In God's view we can be successful in this life only to the extent that we embrace and live the gospel of Jesus Christ and are prepared to return to live with Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />You and I are on a journey that began before we came to earth and for this journey to be successful you and I must follow the Son back into the presence of the Father. Your experiences here at BYU-Idaho can help you throughout your journey. Hopefully you have already learned that the help you need comes not only from the thick textbooks you pore over at night but also from the wondrous workings of the Holy Ghost that can infuse your life with light and knowledge. You are in the early days of your journey and the light and knowledge available at this university can help you climb the ladder of success. As you climb that ladder in the days ahead make sure it is never leaning against the wrong wall.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I said earlier, success in life is not always what it appears to be. Take my earlier example of missionary work. I said that as I young missionary I was under the impression success only came through finding, teaching, and baptizing investigators. Consider what missionaries today learn about success from their study of&nbsp;<em>Preach My Gospel</em>: "Your success as a missionary is measured primarily by your commitment to find, teach, baptize, and confirm people and help them become faithful members of the Church who enjoy the presence of the Holy Ghost."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In the end it is a missionary's commitment to pursue a course that is pleasing to God that determines whether or not their mission is successful. So it is in life. It is the level of our commitment to pursue a course pleasing to God that determines whether we will be successful in this life or not.&nbsp;<em>Preach My Gospel</em>&nbsp;gives all of us insight into how God views success. Consider these words:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You can know you have been a successful missionary when you:&nbsp;&nbsp;Love people and desire their salvation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Obey with exactness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Live so that you can receive and know how to follow the Spirit, who will show you where to go, what to do, and what to say.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Develop Christ-like attributes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Work effectively every day, do your very best to bring souls to Christ, and seek earnestly to learn and improve.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Help build up the Church wherever you are assigned to work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Warn people of the consequences of sin.&nbsp; Invite them to make and keep commitments.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Teach and serve other[s].</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Go about doing good and serving people at every opportunity.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>These truths have wonderful application beyond missionary work. I believe you can know you are having a successful life when you do these same things.&nbsp;<em>Preach My Gospel</em>&nbsp;concludes its discussion of success with these hopeful and helpful thoughts, not just for missionary work but for life itself:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Avoid comparing yourself to others and measuring the outward results of your efforts against theirs. When you have done your very best you may still experience disappointments, but you will not be disappointed in yourself. You can still feel certain that the Lord is pleased when you feel the Spirit working through you."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />If you take nothing more from our brief time today than an internalization of these few words you will be well on your way toward success in life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me mention another construct that I think can help you navigate a course through life that will lead to the success you most desire. In last April's General Conference, Elder Dallin H. Oaks painted a remarkably clear picture of a cause-and-effect process when he said: "Desires dictate our priorities, priorities shape our choices, and choices determine our actions. The desires we act on determine our changing, our achieving, and our becoming."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Desire, which is the title of his talk, lies at the heart of this process of becoming and I encourage each of you to re-read his talk. In the context he created perhaps I could share with you some reflections on another side of this quadrilateral: choice.<em>&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em><em><br /></em>Choice had its origins long before we came to this earth. Indeed, the moral agency to choose is one of the pillars of our Father's plan for us to be successful in this life. You were born into this life without direct knowledge of the moral universe around you. You don't remember your pre-mortal actions, your relationship with God, or the eternal consequences of your choices. Through the gift of agency you have the ability and privilege to choose and act for yourself throughout your life, and so you have quite naturally come to believe you have the power to do whatever you want. So, you choose and the choices you make throughout your life will reveal your true nature and you will become what your choices reveal you to be.&nbsp;<br /><br />What will you choose--and what will you become as a result of your choices?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As you can imagine the scriptures give us great insight into the Lord's counsel on choosing. Let's read one of those scriptures. In the seventh chapter of Moses, a conversation between the prophet Enoch and the Lord is recorded. At one point in this narrative they both view all the people of the earth who have chosen poorly, and suddenly the Lord begins to weep. Enoch is astounded that God could weep and asks him why and "The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency...And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father..."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In this simple description of our Father's plan for our success the Lord says through His tears that He gave us knowledge and agency and only asked two things of us: to love one another and to choose Him; yet those people he and Enoch were observing had apparently done neither, and He wept over what they were becoming.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our choices reveal our true nature and we will become what our choices reveal us to be, and it is only in choosing Him that we can become like Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />A good example of choosing Him came to my attention just a few days ago when I read a newspaper article about Will Hopoate, a young member of the Church in Australia.&nbsp; Let me quote from that article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"A decision made by 19-year-old Will Hopoate, one of the biggest stars in Australian rugby, is making headlines in Australia these days, as he announced his decision to leave professional rugby at the end of the season to serve a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In doing so he is forsaking millions [of dollars]. 'At the end of the day it was all my decision. This is what I want to do,' Hopoate told the media in a press conference. Many are struggling to understand why Hopoate, a hot commodity in the National Rugby League, is choosing this moment to forgo the wealthy, celebrity life of a pro athlete and serve a mission. He said the decision to go on a mission is something he has always considered. His family supports his choice to serve, but he emphasized to reporters that serving a mission has been 100 percent his decision. 'I was brought up in the Mormon faith. This is who I am and what I want to do,' the young rugby star said."</p>
<p>"This is who I am and what I want to do." Those words ought to be part of every important decision you and I make in this life. Can you see from Will's experience how desires dictate our priorities and priorities shape our choices and choices determine our actions and the desires we act on determine our changing, our achieving, and our becoming?&nbsp;<br /><br />What would you do if you were faced with a similar choice? What are your desires? What are your priorities? What would you choose? What would you do? In one way or another you and I will face a decision like Will Hopoate faced a few weeks ago. Such choices are an essential and inevitable part of God's great plan for us to discover for ourselves whether or not we will choose Him. Such choices are the ultimate test of godhood.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I read of Will Hopoate's unfolding story, my mind went back to an experience President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke of almost 20 years ago. It is another example of a young man faced with substantial choices. President Hinckley says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Mine has been the opportunity to meet many wonderful men and women in various parts of the world. A few of them have left an indelible impression upon me. I share with you a story I spoke of some years ago. I met a&nbsp;naval officer&nbsp;from a distant nation, a brilliant young man who had been brought to the United States for advanced training. Some of his associates in the United States Navy, whose behavior had attracted him, shared with him at his request their religious beliefs. He was not a Christian, but he was interested...they taught him the gospel of the Master. The Spirit touched his heart, and he was baptized. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He was introduced to me just before he was to return to his native land. We spoke of these things, and then I said: 'Your people are not Christians. What will happen when you return home a Christian, and, more particularly, a Mormon Christian?' His face clouded, and he replied, 'My family will be disappointed. They may cast me out and regard me as dead. As for my future and my career, all opportunity may be foreclosed against me.' I asked, 'Are you willing to pay so great a price for the gospel?' His dark eyes, moistened by tears, shone from his handsome brown face as he answered, 'It's true, isn't it?' Ashamed at having asked the question, I responded, 'Yes, it's true.' To which he replied, 'Then what else matters?'"<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>This is who I am and what I want to do! It's true isn't it? Then what else really matters? I don't believe we could end our conversation about choosing and success today without considering what some very knowledgeable old crows have learned and shared about those two commandments we read about earlier: loving one another and choosing Him. As we do so I believe you will be able to see that these two simple commandments are the very things that lead to a successful life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me start with the recent words of the most inspired and experienced voice on earth. During a Dixie College commencement address a few weeks ago President Thomas S. Monson observed: "During your life you may achieve wealth or fame or social standing.&nbsp; Real success, however, comes from helping others... My young friends, your life will be fuller, richer and happier if you seek for and find opportunities to be of service."<sup>9</sup><a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2011_06_07_Snow.htm#_edn9" target="_self"></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Real success comes from helping others. Any idea why would that be true? Remember, the Savior said, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;The Son has become like His Father and His Father is defined by love. When we choose Him he asks us to love one another as he loves us. We become like Him by choosing Him and the way he wants us to choose him is by loving one another.&nbsp;<br /><br />During our recent General Conference Elder M. Russell Ballard described it this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Brothers and sisters, the gospel of Jesus Christ is simple, no matter how much we try to make it complicated. We should strive to keep our lives similarly simple, unencumbered by extraneous influences, focused on those things that matter most...&nbsp; It is only when we love God and Christ with all of our hearts, souls, and minds that we are able to share this love with our neighbors through acts of kindness and service--the way that the Savior would love and serve all of us if He were among us today."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>The way we become like him is to choose him and the way he wants us to choose him is by loving one another.&nbsp;<br /><br />Clayton Christensen, formerly one of my brethren in the Seventy, a close friend of President Clark, and a Harvard business professor, put it this way:&nbsp;<br /><br />"I've concluded that the metric by which God will assess my life isn't dollars, but the individual people whose lives I've touched. I think that's the way it will work for us all. Don't worry about the level of individual prominence you have achieved; worry about the individuals you have helped become better people."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />It sounds like all these old crows are in their own way telling us that success in this mortal journey comes from loving and helping our fellow travelers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to thank you for allowing me to visit with you today. As I look into your faces I see the brightness of hope that comes from having the Spirit of God and I feel a reassurance that the true principles of which we have spoken today are in good hands in the years to come. Thank you for coming to this wonderful university, for wanting to learn and grow and do and become.&nbsp;<br /><br />As we conclude our conversation today I want to invite you to love one another and to choose God, over all else, for the remainder of your life. If you do, I promise you will live a successful life. God will give you His power and you will become like Him. If you do not, in the end it will not matter what else you have chosen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Professor of Organizational Leadership and Strategy at BYU</p>
<p>Bio not available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to devote my instruction today to the Prophet Joseph Smith's Epistle to the Church, March 20, 1839--particularly a few verses extracted from it that eventually became part of Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Much, but not all, of what I discuss today will focus on answering a question that seems central to verses 34-46 of Section 121: what are the principles of righteousness for controlling and handling the rights of the priesthood and the powers of heaven?<br /><br />This is not the first time I have tried to answer this question. I wrote a book that was published in 2004,&nbsp;<em>Righteous Influence</em>, that focused primarily on it. The subtitle of&nbsp;<em>Righteous Influence</em>&nbsp;was "What every leader should know about drawing on the powers of heaven." Apparently, there is more to know than I included in the book because the Lord has continued to bless me with insights about the Prophet's Epistle and Section 121.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Think for a moment about my experience in terms of the scriptures and other inspired writings of prophets, seers, and revelators. I have read Section 121 thousands of times and I continue to receive new insights. I'm not making this up or embellishing here and I have convincing evidence. I have completely worn out only these few pages in one set of scriptures and I'm well on my way to wearing out the same pages in another set.&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe I will have accomplished my purpose for speaking today if I can both expand and clarify our understanding of verses 34-45 of Section 121. While these verses have often been used to instruct how we lead the Lord's way-and they certainly work with that purpose in mind-I want to shift perspective only slightly by viewing them as instruction about how to follow God's lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The Prophet's Epistle to the Church</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to use The Prophet's Epistle to the Church as my starting point to provide context for the canonized verses of Section 121. The Prophet's Epistle has an interesting history. It was written near the end of Joseph Smith's 128-day incarceration in Liberty Jail. It was written over a five-day period-March 20-25th, which were his and his companions' 111th to 115th days in Liberty Jail-in response to letters Joseph received on March 19.&nbsp;<br /><br />Two men served as scribes for the Epistle, Caleb Baldwin and Alexander McRae. The verses from Section 121 that are my focus today were written in the hand of Alexander McRae. Alexander McRae had an interesting physical characteristic-he was 6' 6" tall. Those of you who have been to the Church's visitors center in Liberty, Missouri, know the ceilings of the jail are only 6' 2" high. We understand better the unique suffering of Alexander McRae when we realize that for over four months he could not have known the feeling of straightening his tall frame. Of course, he probably didn't notice given all the other trials he and his fellow inmates had to endure.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Church Historian's Office still has possession of the original March 20, 1839 letter, and the text of the letter was first published in 1840 in the Times and Seasons in two installments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There have been numerous answered and unanswered questions about the Epistle over the years-too many to address, and if we were to address them they would distract us from our primary purpose. I, however, do want to share one conclusion from what is now a 10-year study of the history of the Epistle. Every shred of evidence suggests that Orson Pratt, under the direction of President Brigham Young, attempted to be as true as possible to the original text of the Epistle when he took passages from it to create Sections 121, 122, and 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, in the interest of time, let's turn to today's central question.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The Principles of Righteousness</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />What are the principles of righteousness for controlling and handling the rights of the priesthood and the powers of heaven? This question arises in my mind from reading verse 36, and it seems extremely central and important to the gospel of Jesus Christ and the doctrine of the priesthood.&nbsp;<br /><br />We, first, learn in verse 37 about what nullifies the rights of the priesthood. We could call verse 37 the principle of unrighteous actions. Reference is made to three unrighteous actions: 1) covering our sins; 2) gratifying our pride, our vain ambitions; and 3) exercising unrighteous control or dominion or compulsion on others. A man may be called to a priesthood office or calling, but the heavenly power associated with that office or calling is withdrawn immediately, if he performs any one of these three unrighteous actions. It's described as being as dramatic as turning off a power switch.&nbsp;<br /><br />Section 3 of the Doctrine and Covenants instructs further about what happens. This is the revelation about the lost 116 pages of the original Book of Mormon manuscript. First of all, Section 3 is compelling evidence that Joseph Smith was not "covering his sins." Quite the contrary, he was uncovering them by sharing this revelation, initially, with his family and friends, but also by including it in the Book of Commandments and later the Doctrine and Covenants.&nbsp;<br /><br />What were the actions for which Joseph Smith was censured by the Lord? That is, how did he violate the principle of unrighteous actions?&nbsp; In verses 4-7 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do many mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and carnal desires, he must fall and incur the vengeance of a just God upon him.&nbsp;"Behold, you have been entrusted with these things, but how strict were your commandments; and remember also the promises which were made to you, if you did not transgress them.&nbsp;"And behold, how often you have transgressed the commandments and the laws of God, and have gone on in the persuasions of men.&nbsp;"For, behold, you should not have feared man more than God.&nbsp; Although men set at naught the counsels of God, and despise his words-"</p>
<p>As verse 4 clearly states, Joseph's unrighteous action was one all too common among men and women-we gratify our pride and pursue our own vain ambitions. Within this broader unrighteous action, Joseph's transgression was more specific-he "feared man more than God."&nbsp; Again, any one of the three unrighteous actions disconnects one from priesthood power. With that said, I see no evidence from the episode of the lost 116 pages of the Book of Mormon manuscript of Joseph exercising unrighteous dominion, but these verses in Section 3 are a wonderful example of righteous, in this case godly, reproof (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:43).&nbsp;<br /><br />By combining instruction from Sections 3 and 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants we gain a clearer picture of the principle of unrighteous actions or the "off" switch to a heavenly power source. But what is the "on" switch? What does a priesthood holder need to do to establish or re-establish his connection to heavenly power? What are the corresponding principles of righteousness? What I have learned from my continued study of Section 121 is the answer is far clearer than I thought, even long after the publication of my book,&nbsp;<em>Righteous Influence</em>. It's important for me to set the record straight.&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe I correctly identified two of the three principles of righteousness from verse 45-charity and virtue. What I missed, however, was the connection between verses 44 and 45 (I had previously connected verse 44 with verse 43). I had assumed the other principle of righteousness was faith. Linking verses 44 and 45, however, suggests that it is faithfulness. I now believe the intended meaning of verse 44 is: "That he [the individual whom the Spirit has moved you to reprove] may know that thy faithfulness [not to him, but to God] is stronger than the cords of death." A priesthood holder demonstrates his faithfulness to God by being compliant with His instructions, unless he is moved to do otherwise by the Spirit. He follows God's lead.&nbsp;<br /><br />On the surface, the distinction between faith and faithfulness seems trivial. Aren't having faith and faithfulness essentially the same thing? Not exactly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Having faith in Jesus Christ is believing in Him and His redemptive power. We approach the Lord, as the father of the epileptic child, pleading, "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief" (see Mark 9:24). On the other hand, our faithfulness to God is measured by our sole devotion to Him. It is our adherence to the first and great commandment (see Matthew 22:38). In the divine accolade to the two servants who increased their talents in the Parable of the Talents, we learn we are considered "good and faithful" when we are faithful over the few things we are charged to do, and this is how we act in accordance to God's will, and ultimately earn an eternal reward. Understanding the principle of stewardship, the "good and faithful" servants acted on behalf of their master. Likely, they imagined what he would do if he were present and did it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The belief that builds from faith in Jesus Christ and the devotion to God that stems from our faithfulness to Him are both essential to following God's lead. Together they form a virtuous cycle-faith leads to greater faithfulness and greater faithfulness leads to greater faith. When we view mortal life as a faith-testing and faith-building experience, it becomes profoundly clear how faith and faithfulness keep us close to God as they start, support, and sustain us along the pathway to eternal life.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Faith and Faithfulness to God</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />While the principles of faith in Jesus Christ and faithfulness to God are inseparable, the imagery of Lehi's dream helps me distinguish between them. In his dream, Lehi saw an iron rod that extended from the river bank, and then led to the tree of life (1 Nephi 8:19). He saw three different groups of people moving toward the tree of life.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first group started along the path to the tree of life, but they did not hold to the iron rod, and when they came to a mist of darkness they wandered off and became lost. The second group clung to the iron rod and pressed forward through the mist of darkness until they came and partook of the fruit of the tree. But they were ashamed when the people who filled the great and spacious building on the other side of the river mocked and pointed their fingers at them. Fearing men and women more than loving God, they, too, fell away and became lost. Finally, the third group found its way to the tree of life by faithfully holding to the iron rod, and they fell down and partook of the fruit (see verses 21-30). They were so overwhelmed from tasting of the love of God that they completely lost their fear of men and women.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The members of all three groups had sufficient faith to enter by the gate on the "strait and narrow path," but only those who pressed "forward with a steadfastness in Christ" received eternal life (see 2 Nephi 31:18-20). Lehi's dream teaches us something all of us know about our faith in Jesus Christ-it ebbs and flows, there are high tides and low tides. We should not be embarrassed by this, since it is a critical design feature of God's eternal plan. Why is faithfulness to God an essential companion to faith in Jesus Christ? It gets us through the clouds of darkness.&nbsp;<br /><br />The prophet Abraham is the father of the faithful. What does this mean? It means that the covenant made between God and Abraham is extended to all who are faithful, whether they are among Abraham's literal seed or adopted into the house of Israel. Being a "good and faithful" servant is the principal criterion for receiving the blessings promised to Abraham.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the history of the world, there is no better example than Abraham of someone who was led through difficult, even impossible challenges by his faith in God. In the eleventh chapter of Hebrews we read about Abraham's faith:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.&nbsp;"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:&nbsp;"For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. . . .&nbsp;"By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,&nbsp;"Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:&nbsp;"Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead . . ." (Hebrews 11:8-10; 17-19).</p>
<p>How did Abraham do it? There is only one answer to this question that makes any sense-Abraham faithfully followed God's lead each step of the way.&nbsp;<br /><br />Abraham is not only an extraordinary example of faith and faithfulness; he was also clearly on Joseph Smith's mind when he wrote the Prophet's Epistle to the Church. Sandwiched between the passages extracted for Section 121, Joseph wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And now, beloved brethren, we say unto you, that inasmuch as God hath said that He would have a tried people [. . .] it will be a trial of our faith equal to that of Abraham, and that the ancients will not have whereof to boast over us in the day of judgment, as being called to pass through heavier afflictions; that we may hold an even weight in the balance with them; but now, after having suffered so great sacrifice and having passed through so great a season of sorrow, we trust that a ram may be caught in the thicket speedily, to relieve the sons and daughters of Abraham from their great anxiety, and to light up the lamp of salvation upon their countenances, that they may hold on now, after having gone so far unto everlasting life."</p>
<p>In this passage, Joseph likens the trial of the Latter-day Saints' faith to the trials of Abraham, and by implication he implores them to be faithful, like Abraham, to the covenants they had made.&nbsp; In effect, he was reminding them of the promise found in 1 Corinthians 10:13-" . . . but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it." The Abrahamic covenant is a covenant of faithfulness between God and man-there is no question that God will be faithful to us if we are faithful to Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />How does a priesthood holder show his faithfulness to God? He follows God's instructions with exactness, unless the Spirit moves him to do otherwise. In Section 121, God's instructions are simple and straightforward:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy and without guile-&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved lest he esteem thee to be his enemy . . ." (Doctrine and Covenants 121:41-43).</p>
<p>These instructions are unmistakably connected to the words of Paul in his second epistle to the Corinthian Church. Paul wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned" (2 Corinthians 6:4-6).</p>
<p>In my mind's eye, I imagine Joseph Smith, along with his companions in Liberty Jail, reading from 2 Corinthians in what Elder Neal A. Maxwell called their temple-prison, and receiving peace and deeper resolve to be faithful to the end; to remain virtuous in their thoughts, and have charity fill their souls for all men, even the prison guards they could hear just above them, who were near-perfect in their execution of unrighteous dominion. It's an inspiring image, even if one pauses for only a moment to dwell on it.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Following God's Lead</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />I have heard it said many times that the instruction given in verses 41-43 of Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants teaches us how to lead as Jesus did. It is a recipe for leading the Lord's way. Leading in the Lord's way is not leading in the traditional sense. After Jesus washed the feet of His disciples, He taught them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him" (John 13:14-16).</p>
<p>Jesus set an example for His disciples by humbly washing their feet, but this act and everything else He has done on our behalf is, first and foremost, an expression of His faithfulness to His Father. As Jesus taught many times, He is the perfect expression of God, the Father, and He always does "those things that please him" (see John 8:29; John 5:19; Doctrine &amp; Covenants 50:43). Since the beginning of time, the Savior has represented the will of the Father and ascribed all glory to Him (see Moses 4:2). This is why the Son could represent the Father in saving all mankind. As Paul wrote to the Corinthians: "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ . . ." (see 2 Corinthians 5:18). We often think of Jesus Christ as the perfect exemplar. Paul explained why it was necessary, as part of God's eternal plan, for Jesus to be the perfect exemplar. We become reconciled to God by Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />What does it mean to be reconciled to God? First, we must recognize that reconciliation to God is not something we accomplish on our own. Nephi understood and taught his people they must believe in Christ to be reconciled to God, ". . . for it is by [His] grace that we are saved, after all that we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23). Second, we must understand what reconciliation means, if we are to do all that we can do to be reconciled to God.&nbsp;<br /><br />I can trace my first exposure to the word reconcile and my knowledge of the reconciliation process to a summer when I was a teenager working for the retail chain that employed my father as its chief financial officer. While I eventually moved to the Accounts Payable Department where I had a different boss, the first summer I worked directly for my father. My job was simple. I was given a desk with a four-function calculator, which as hard as it is to believe 45 years later, took up most of the space on the desk. I was given stacks of hand-written spreadsheets and asked to add the rows and columns in order to reconcile them. For example, there was an annual sales spreadsheet that had the monthly sales totals broken out by department. I was expected to add the columns to arrive at monthly sales totals, and also add the rows, which gave me year-to-date sales figures by department. The column totals and the row totals were not reconciled until they produced the same grand total in the bottom right-hand corner of the spreadsheet. Until I arrived at the same grand total I knew I had made a mistake and there was more work to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The greatest challenge I experienced reconciling a spreadsheet's row and column totals was finding my mistakes. I never knew whether my mistake was in the row or column totals, and sometimes it was both. Reconciliation would have been much easier if I knew the grand total was perfect and correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our loving Father in Heaven, in His infinite wisdom created a perfect plan by which we could be reconciled to Him. First, He brought His perfect Son into the world. Jesus was without sin-He was a perfect and correct example of righteousness, and, therefore, we could be reconciled to God by being reconciled to Him. Then, through God, the Father's infinite grace, He allowed His Son, the only perfect man, to atone for the sins of His other children. Because Jesus Christ is faithful to God's perfect plan, everything we cannot do on our own, He, in His pre-ordained role as our Savior and Redeemer, does for us.&nbsp;<br /><br />We know because Christ is the perfect and correct example of righteousness that leading His way is leading God's way. If we truly desire to lead as Jesus led, we will follow God's lead. The instruction given in verses 41-43 of Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants can be understood at two levels-it reveals both how God leads, and, in turn, how Jesus Christ follows God's lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Why is it even important to make the distinction between how God leads and how Jesus Christ follows God's lead? First, I believe there is widespread confusion about what it means to lead, both in and out of the Church. Jerry Harvey, not a member of the Church, but a deeply religious man who is also a well-known organizational scientist, once told me: "You don't know anything about a leader until you know something about his prayer life." In prayer, a leader communes with God, in the name of Jesus Christ, to determine His holy mind and will. When leaders pray to God, especially on bended knee with head bowed, they acknowledge to Him their desire to follow His lead. They approach God, recognizing their inadequacies as well as their need for divine intervention. Even Jesus Christ, who was perfect and correct, still prayed to His Father. Always and perfectly He followed God's lead.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second, I don't believe it's enough for Church leaders to know how to lead God's way-they must also strive to learn why God leads the way He does. Your president, President Clark, when he was a professor at the Harvard Business School, made the distinction between know-how and know-why as he wrote about manufacturing and research and development processes. Generally, know-why indicates a deeper understanding than know-how. Often, we know how to operate something without having even the most basic knowledge of why it works.&nbsp;<br /><br />Why do I believe a Church leader needs to know why, in addition to knowing how, to lead God's way? This answer can also be found in Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants. In addition to being taught how to lead in God's way in verses 41-43, Joseph Smith was also taught the principle of unrighteous actions and the principles of righteousness. By taking an additional step back, focusing on verses 26-33 of Section 121, it also becomes clear that these principles are linked to the ultimate context for all know-why questions, knowledge about God's eternal plan of salvation. Verse 26, for example, speaks of knowledge "that has not been revealed since the world was until now." In verse 32, we learn more about this knowledge-it ". . . was ordained in the midst of the Council of the Eternal God . . . [and] reserved unto the finishing and the end . . . when every man shall enter into his eternal presence and into his immortal rest."&nbsp;<br /><br />It is possible for leaders to learn about why God leads the way He does by following His lead-not mindlessly, but inquisitively. A leader who follows God's lead and considers His ways will receive inspiration about His mind and will. We do not earn these insights, like students who are particularly attentive in class. Rather, as with all inspiration, insights into why God leads as He does are gifts from Him. These gifts are given gradually, not all at once. If they were given all at once, they would overwhelm us and we would not appreciate their full value, much like a child who has too much Christmas.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ultimately, a deeper understanding of God's leadership will help us better follow His lead.&nbsp; It's easy to forget in this confusing world in which we live, with so many side streets and blind alleys, that the most direct way to eternal life is following God's lead. Jesus Christ was the correct and perfect exemplar of this surprisingly simple truth, which even less surprisingly also provides the surest way to be reconciled to God. Following God's lead is also the most direct way to help others receive eternal life and the surest way to receive the powers of heaven to serve others.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As Church leaders follow God's lead and learn more about His mind and will, they become more like Him. In effect, the virtuous cycle of faith in Jesus Christ and faithfulness to God expands, and the promised blessings of the Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood are fulfilled. What are these blessings? Again, they are the blessings of eternal life. In the words of the Son of God: "And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him" (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:38).&nbsp;<br /><br />I invite all of you to be faithful to God and follow His lead. I promise you this is the most direct way to eternal life, and bear testimony that it is God's plan for each of us to return to Him and live with Him eternally. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>I am grateful to be here today. We have had some of our best interns, administrative assistants, etc. come from this university. I have been impressed by the quality of students who come with integrity, capability, and gospel-centered lives. I congratulate the choir that sang during the April 2011 General Conference Saturday afternoon session. It was beautiful.&nbsp;<br /><br />What I will say today will be nothing new. I am grateful for President Clark's devotional talk given on April 19, 2011 when he talked about deep obedience.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I would like to add another opportunity for each of us to be obedient, to recognize Heavenly Father's love for us, and to choose to become like the Savior and bless the lives of those around us. I invite the Spirit to be with us to penetrate our hearts and move us to action.&nbsp;<br /><br />I will begin with a story of Spencer, my nephew. One day when he was three years old, I attended the closing part of Primary with him and his Sunbeam class. A neighbor boy, Phillip, was in the class. I sat with Spence and the Sunbeams on the front row. All of a sudden I felt a pinch on the side of my face. I looked down at the little boy who had inflicted pain. He was grinning. It was Phillip. He continued to pinch me until I took his hand and asked him to stop.&nbsp;<br /><br />He then proceeded to try and move Spencer out of his seat, roll on the ground, hit another child, run up to the front of the room, and generally cause commotion. Spencer watched all of this dumbfounded and he and I just looked at each other. We got Phillip back in his seat. I tried to give him attention, put my arm around him, and help him be reverent. He was a handful. We made it to the end of the meeting and Phillip ran out of the room. Spence didn't say much on the ride home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />His parents and I got dinner ready. As we were sitting around the table eating, he explained the experience with Phillip during Primary, recalling each incident. Finally, after sharing the details he made this emphatic declaration, "Phillip is not a child of God." We all just sat there puzzled at what he had just said and then got huge grins on our faces and tried not to laugh but be understanding. I recognized that Spencer had been taught by his parents who a child of God was and how he should act and the difference between this and his friend's actions.&nbsp;<br /><br />We all know that Philip is a child of God and so is each one of you. This scripture teaches us, "Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the greatest truths is that each of us is a son or daughter of a Heavenly Father who loves us. We have an elder brother, Jesus Christ, who suffered, died, and was resurrected because of love for each one who has lived and who will ever live on the earth. You ask, "Julie, how can I know that this is true? That Heavenly Father and Jesus know me and love me?" Today I will talk about two ways: first, we know by the testimony of others and by our own experiences, and second, by serving and loving his sons and daughters.&nbsp;<br /><br />First, we hear it from the words of others who have a solid testimony of these things and by the experiences we have.&nbsp;<br /><br />I remember well a talk given by Virginia H. Pearce, daughter of our late prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, regarding our relationship to Heavenly Father. Her talk was entitled, "Faith is the Answer." I quote, "We all know that more faith won't make our problems disappear. But I believe as our faith increases, we become more able to not only survive the hard times but become better because of them. I believe faith is the answer." Sister Pearce goes on to describe what faith means. Please feel the Spirit bearing witness of these truths as I say them to you. They are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ live, and they are in charge of the world.<br />They know me.<br />They love me.<br />They have a plan for my future.<br />I will obey the commandments, work hard, and trust in their plan. Sooner or later, everything will be okay.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>I know this is true for me and it is true for each one of you. If you don't know, kneel down and pray with all the energy of heart and I bear witness to you that Heavenly Father will let you know of the infinite love He has for you. Take the time to do this tonight and then tomorrow until you know beyond a shadow of a doubt it is true.&nbsp;<br /><br />Four-year-old Alex knew this was true. When he was in preschool, Valentine's Day was coming up. He decided to sign all the valentines for his friends by himself. It took a long time to sign six valentines with the letters, A-L-E-X. He did it painstakingly.&nbsp;<br /><br />The day came and he and his mother got in the car to drive to preschool. Forgetting a note Alex needed to take to school, his mother asked if he knew where the note was. He didn't know so suggested they pray. She agreed. As soon as the prayer was done, she remembered where the note was in the home, ran and got it and hurried back to the car. The first thing Alex said was, "It wooked! I didn't think it would wook and it wooked." His mother asked, "What worked? "We pwayed and we found the note." She agreed and started the car, when all of a sudden they remembered Alex had forgotten his valentines and he didn't know where he had left them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alex said, "Let's pway again." Thinking that his testimony would be shattered if she didn't find the valentines, she said, "No, I'm sure I can find them." She again ran into the house. After a short time, she came out smiling, having found the lost valentines. The minute she got in the car Alex exclaimed, "It wooked again." She asked, "What worked?" "I pwayed again and it wooked. We found the valentines."&nbsp; The faith of a child. If Alex knows that Heavenly Father knows him and loves him and if Alex trusts Heavenly Father enough to pray for help in the issues of notes and valentines, how much should we also trust and know that He is there.&nbsp;<br /><br />The people on the American continent knew. In 3 Nephi, when the Savior visited the American continent, we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;"Behold, I am Jesus Christ whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.&nbsp; And behold, I am the light and the life of the world."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then the Savior invited the crowd who had fallen to the ground in reverence to arise, and He said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet...&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do going forth one by one."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a tender experience for each individual. This is "Julie Merrill doctrine," but I believe that He addressed them by name. He knew them.&nbsp; They were His lambs and He knew them and He loved them. If Christ knew each of these people, I bear witness that He knows you and that He loves you and He wants to be there to bless you as you let him in.&nbsp;<br /><br />My friend, Lynne, knows this is true. Lynne told me about a time when she was working two jobs to pay the bills. Her day started at 6:00 a.m. and ended at midnight. One day as she was driving home exhausted, she started talking out loud to Heavenly Father letting him know she wasn't sure she could do this for much longer or anymore. As she was driving in the quiet of her car, she felt as if the Savior was hugging her. A total peace came over her whole body. She had the distinct impression He was there with her and would help her through this difficult time. She had a reassurance that everything would be all right.&nbsp;<br /><br />She went on to say that she has learned through experiences that sometimes the feeling that comes from Heavenly Father is a calm feeling. Sometimes there is an urgency to do something right at the moment. Whatever it is, she knows that Heavenly Father and the Savior know her, love her, and are there to help her through whatever the circumstances. She is learning to recognize the constant blessings and support coming from above.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Two wonderful verses in Isaiah testify again that the Savior knows us. He loves us. He wants to help us through this life. "Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness." These are great promises. He goes on to say, "For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, fear not; I will help thee."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;I love the imagery of the Lord holding my right hand. Sometimes when I am struggling I will take the Lord by the hand, inviting Him in and knowing He is there. He does know each of us.&nbsp;<br /><br />The second way I believe we can know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ know us and love us is by the opportunities we have to give their love to those around us. In the book of Enos we read about Enos going to hunt beasts in the forests, and he remembered the words his Father had told about the joy of the saints. He says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And there came a voice unto me, saying; Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them..."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Notice how Enos once he felt the Lord's love, immediately wanted to bless the lives of others. We, too, once we feel of His love, will be praying to be an instrument to care for our brothers and sisters on this earth. And who is my brother? Each person we come in contact is our brother or sister. For the last few years in my morning prayers, I have asked Heavenly Father to guide me to someone who needs His help through me. I have had some incredible experiences that have been a blessing because of this simple request. Let me share one with you.&nbsp;<br /><br />I work in downtown Salt Lake City. A number of years ago, I parked my car about 1&frac12; blocks from the office. One day as I was crossing the street, I noticed a grandmother-like woman standing on the opposite corner. She had her bathrobe on. I walked up to her and asked how she was doing. She said she was fine. I asked what she was doing. She said she was out for her morning walk. I thought that was interesting and asked where she had walked from. She mentioned a place five miles away. I heard what she said and then was shocked. It was 7:30 a.m. How did she walk that far? In my mind I wondered what time she started.&nbsp;<br /><br />And then I looked down at her feet and noticed she was wearing slippers and the thought came to me and I asked her, "Did you walk from the rest home a block away?" She said, "I think so." I offered to walk her home. Slowly, we walked arm in arm down the street. She told me about her children and that she loved music. She talked about how happy she was.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When we entered the rest home, a nurse hollered out, "Mary, did you leave the home again?" She smiled. I told the nurse who was coming towards us we had just walked from the corner. Mary thanked me and invited me to come again and the nurse whisked her off down the hall. What a marvelous experience. Heavenly Father blessed me to be able to help someone in need. I thanked him for the experience and walked happily to work.&nbsp;<br /><br />David, a single man from Salt Lake said, "Make a concerted effort to reach beyond yourself and look for opportunities to serve. Acts of service can be as simple as a kind word, an expression of appreciation, a listening ear, etc. You will find that there are innumerable opportunities to serve others every day. Seek to give more than you take. Try to leave things better than the way you found them."&nbsp;<br /><br />Another friend said, "I'm trying to remember that even though I am single the world doesn't revolve around my needs and wants. This is a unique time to provide service to my community and to others."&nbsp;<br /><br />Clayton M. Christensen, a member of the Church and a professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School, gave the commencement speech at Southern Utah University on May 6, 2011.&nbsp; In his talk entitled, "The Importance of the Right Question," he shares an experience in his life when he felt he was going to get a promotion. When another man had been asked to take the job instead, he was crushed. He says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Somehow, after all of this, I came to understand that while men and women might measure their lives by summary statistics such as number of people presided over; how high in a hierarchy they are promoted, and so on, the only metrics that God will apply to my life are the individuals whom I have been able to help become better people, one-by-one. When I have my interview with God when my life is over; the fact that I held the title of a professor at Harvard won't even come up in the conversation. Rather, God will say, 'I put you in that situation, and then that one. Let's just discuss the individual people you helped become better people, using the talents that I gave to you.'&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"His conversation with each of you will be similar--comprised of a recounting of the individuals whose self-esteem you were able to strengthen, whose talents you were able to reinforce; and whose discomforts you were able to assuage, in all of the situations that you will find yourself in the years ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Every day I ask God to help me find someone whose life I might bless in some way.&nbsp; Because I ask the questions; God gives me the answers."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>President Uchtdorf in the September 2008 General Relief Society Meeting said, "In the end, the number of prayers we say may contribute to our happiness, but the number of prayers we answer may be of even greater importance."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Book of Mormon, in 4th Nephi, after Christ had visited the American continent, we read about a people who "had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free and partakers of the heavenly gift...and all manner of miracles did they work among the children of men...in the name of Jesus..." They had the love of God which did dwell in their hearts and there was no contention in the land... "And there were no envying, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God...and how blessed were they. For the Lord did bless them in all their doings."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />As I thought about the BYU-Idaho campus, I imagined a similar atmosphere among you where there were not a happier people in all the land because they did bless the lives of each other every day. Each person unselfishly regarding the well-being of his or her neighbor equal to his own. This can be your campus culture as each of you chooses to be guided to bless the life or lives of those you come in contact with every day and as you are sensitive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Please take the challenge to know in your heart that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ live, and they are in charge of the world. They know you. They love you. They have a plan for your future. As you obey the commandments, work hard, and trust in their plan, sooner or later everything will be okay. I also challenge you to pray every day to be guided to those persons who need the Lord's love. You are instruments in the Savior's hands to bless our brothers and sisters.&nbsp;<br /><br />I bear my witness that these things are true. Feel of our Heavenly Father and the Savior's love. Listen for the quiet messages of help and guidance that will come to each of you. Reach out to bless the life of every person you meet. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ live. President Thomas S. Monson is our prophet today. This gospel is the truth on the earth. &nbsp;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

Menlove&nbsp;as general president of the Primary organization.&nbsp;Lant chose&nbsp;Margaret S. Lifferth&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vicki F. Matsumori&nbsp;as her counselors. She was released at the church's April 2010 General Conference and succeeded by&nbsp;Rosemary M. Wixom.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure for me to meet here with you this afternoon. I love the feeling that is here at this university. It is strong and vibrant and alive. You are so blessed to be here. Today, I have felt prompted to talk about spirituality in our lives. And to begin with, I want you to ask yourselves a question: "Am I a spiritual person?" If your answer is an automatic "yes," how do you know? What does being spiritual mean to you? What does it look like? What does it feel like to you? If your answer is uncertain, why do you feel that way? Why do you question yourself? What are your expectations of being spiritual?<br /><br />Perhaps answers to these questions will become clearer to us as we better understand what spirituality is, and how we experience it, and how we can strengthen it in our lives.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Let me begin by relating an experience to you that I had many years ago when my children were young. One evening while my husband and I were entertaining another couple in our home, the wife began telling us of several "spiritual experiences" she had had. They were comprised of dreams and visions and audible messages sent to her from God. As I listened, at first I was amazed. I didn't really question her experiences--and I still don't--because that is not my place. But as she talked, my feelings went from amazement of her experiences to doubt in myself, because I had never had&nbsp; manifestations of the Spirit that were like that. I began to question my faith, my spirituality.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, I knew that she was a good--really good--person. But I knew that I was really trying to be good as well. I was reading my scriptures, praying regularly, trying to keep the commandments, serving in the Church, working to be true to all the covenants I had made with the Lord. In short, I was like many of you--trying hard. I was not by any means perfect, but I felt worthy and I was working at it. I had felt that I was pretty much on the same level as my friend. But I was not seeing the heavens open to me in the same way she was describing and I really began to question myself.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later in the evening, I began to ask my husband the same questions I am asking you to ask yourselves today. Am I a spiritual person? What is spirituality? What should I expect it to feel like and look like in my life?&nbsp;<br /><br />Over the years since that time, I have learned a lot about myself, and about my Heavenly Father, and about spirituality. I would like to share some of what I have learned with you today.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is much to learn about spirituality in the scriptures. We are all familiar with the story of Lehi's dream. We know about the large and spacious field, which represents the world into which we all are born. We can visualize the river running through it, the mists of darkness, the great and spacious building, all of which represent the distractions offered by Satan. We recognize the dangers of materialism, pride, temptation, sin, and fear. But we are encouraged by the safety and stability of the rod of iron, which runs along a straight and narrow path. This path and the rod represent the word of God that can keep us safe and take us to our goal. And the goal is to reach the tree with its beautiful white fruit, which represents the Savior and His great atonement, and which enables us to obtain eternal life in the presence of our Heavenly Father and His son Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />What do we learn from this? Well, one thing we learn is that we have to have a goal. We have to be determined to return to the Savior. We learn about what dangers to avoid and that safety comes only as we are true to gospel principles. We learn about being exactly obedient. We learn something about the happiness and peace that can be ours if we reach the tree with its wonderful fruit. But I think that most of all we learn that our whole attention must be focused on the Savior, all of the time, in order to make it back to Him. That is how we must live: focused on our Savior.&nbsp;<br /><br />To me this is what spirituality really is. It is having our lives, our center, anchored to the Savior. It is living our lives in a "Christ" centered world rather than a "me" centered world. Spirituality is focusing our lives on Christ because we love Him, and then, we can have His Spirit, the Holy Ghost, with us constantly to help us. He has promised in 3 Nephi 18:11: "...and if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you."&nbsp;<br /><br />In&nbsp;<em>Mormon Doctrine</em>, it states: "Spirituality is that state which enables men to enjoy the near-constant companionship of the Lord's Spirit."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />So, we might ask, how does the Holy Ghost help us to be more spiritual? Well, he draws us back to the Savior and Heavenly Father. He is their messenger to us. It is through him that they answer our prayers. He testifies of truth. He is a protector and comforter. He is a teacher. But he does much more. Listen to the insight given us by Parley P. Pratt:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The Holy Ghost quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands and purifies all the natural passions and affections; and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use. It inspires, develops, cultivates and matures all the fine-toned sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings and affections of our nature. It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness and charity. It develops beauty of person, form and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation and social feeling. It invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens, and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>The Holy Ghost not only draws us closer to our Savior as we center our life on Him, he helps us become more like Him. Spirituality is strengthened in the process.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, what do we need to do in order to get to a place in our lives that this becomes a reality for us--where we have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost and are really focused on the Savior in everything we do? Well, the answers are simple and straight forward. They are things we have been taught since childhood and they are basic principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We will talk of just three of these principles today: prayer, scripture study, and obedience. They are true principles, and we are going to not only spend just a few minutes talking about them but we will talk about how we can apply them in our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let us consider prayer. In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told: "If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things - that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal" (Doctrine and Covenants 42:61).&nbsp;<br /><br />This scripture gives us a commandment: "thou shalt ask." And it gives us a beautiful promise that if we ask we shall receive revelation, knowledge, knowing the mysteries and peaceable things and having joy and life eternal. All of these blessings would undoubtedly bring greater spirituality in our lives. But let me ask you a question: what do you think it means to "ask"? In Doctrine and Covenants 7:48 it says: "Pray unto the Father with all energy of heart..."&nbsp;<br /><br />I think that prayers offered in haste or when we are falling asleep at night are not going to quite measure up. I think that if we want the promised blessings our prayers cannot be casual. They must be sincere and from our heart. We must give prayer more than just a passing thought.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma really describes the kind of prayer that we should offer in Alma 34:18-27:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yea, cry (Notice that he says "cry," not just "ask.") unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save." (This is talking about repentance.)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him." (When we repent, we need to pray for the strength to continue to live as we should.)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea over all your flocks." (Heavenly Father cares about what we care about and He will help us even with our temporal concerns.) &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day and evening." (He wants us to pray earnestly about everything in our lives, and He has specified that our prayers are to be pretty much continual--morning, noon and night.)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies." (We pray for protection and help.)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness." (We must ask for protection from temptation because only the powers of heaven can keep us safe.)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase." (We are to pray for success in school, work, and life in general.)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But this is not all, ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness." (What is your secret place or your wilderness? I think he is asking us here to pray diligently for help with things that challenge us personally--our secret weaknesses and desolate places and that we do not do it for the honors of man.)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you." (This would be the prayer of the heart--a reaching continually to heaven for divine help in our lives even when we are not on our knees.)</p>
<p>But brothers and sisters, when we pray as described in this scripture, we are really seeking the help of the Lord. But even so, effective prayer isn't just about intensity. We must ponder and then pray. After praying and while going about our daily activities, we need to listen for the answers, and then we must do the things that we feel prompted to do. Truly, this kind of prayer would only be possible if our lives were focused on the Savior. This kind of prayer indicates a beautiful depth of spirituality.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now what about scripture study and its effect on our spirituality? President Spencer W. Kimball said: "I find that when I get casual in my relationship with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I know that this is true. When I am consistently in the scriptures, messages that strengthen me are continually opened up to me. The scriptures are as a Urim and Thummim to guide me through life. As I read them faithfully, I am happier. I am more grounded and at peace. I am closer to my Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. My spirituality strengthens.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our scriptures are a great gift from our Heavenly Father, but they are only a blessing to us if we read and study them. I have heard it said that we are blessed to have the Book of Mormon, but we are no better off than the rest of the world if we do not read it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now let's talk about obedience and its affect on our spirituality, because all of our prayers and the knowledge we gain when reading the scriptures do us no good unless we are willing to act upon what we receive. Heavenly Father has not given us the commandments in order to control us. He has given them to us to free us from the bondage of sin and to bless us with eternal blessings. He has given them to us so that we might travel that straight and narrow path in safety. He has given them to us to bring us safely home to Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />Obedience requires that we overcome the natural man--overcoming pride, materialism, lusts of the flesh, and temptations of every kind--and turn to God's ways. President David O. McKay said: "Spirituality is the consciousness of victory over self, and communion with the infinite." President McKay also said: "Spirituality impels one to conquer difficulties and acquire more and more strength. To feel one's faculties unfolding and truth expanding the soul is one of life's sublimest experiences."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you really believe that we can claim to be spiritual if we are, through our disobedience and in moments of weakness, allowing the influences of the world to come into our lives whether it is through books, movies, television, the Internet, or other people? Can we tolerate just a little casualness in our modesty or our moral cleanliness? Can we rationalize certain activities on the Sabbath day just because everyone else is doing it or maybe we think it is something that is just not that big of a deal? Can we do these things and excuse ourselves thinking that we are not hurting anyone but ourselves?&nbsp; Can we expect our spiritual natures to escape damage when we do these things?&nbsp;<br /><br />Certainly at that moment of disobedience we cannot. But on the other hand, do we have to be perfect all the time in order to receive the blessings of spirituality? Well, if that were the case, none of us would ever feel the Spirit. Heavenly Father does not expect perfection in this life. He expects worthiness. One of the meanings of perfection is completeness. You will remember that early in Christ's ministry He taught us to be perfect even as our Father in Heaven is perfect. Then, after His atonement and crucifixion, He taught us to be perfect even as He and our Father in Heaven are perfect. It was not until after His mission was completed that He claimed perfection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So worthiness means that we are on the path of righteousness, trying every day to be better than we did yesterday. It means that we keep our focus on the Savior, repenting when necessary, serving Him, being obedient to His commandments and honoring the covenants we have made, relying on the Holy Ghost to help us and strengthen us spiritually. It means that it is only through the atonement of Jesus Christ that we will eventually become perfect after all we can do. And it means that all of us are going to feel more spiritual at certain times than we do at others. It means that it is a process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe that as we work to do the things that will bring us closer to the Savior, spirituality is not some vague concept that is hard to understand or bring into our lives. It is real and it is there. It is practical and tangible. It is something we can get hold of. Let me describe how it might work. When we have challenges in our lives, if we are strong spiritually, we turn our thoughts immediately to the Savior for answers and help. When we have decisions to make, spiritual strength turns us to the Lord for directions. When we see a beautiful sunset or a glorious morning, and our souls expand in gratitude to the Savior for all the blessings of this earth life, that is spirituality. When we experience sorrows or pain, the comfort we receive as we turn to the Lord, is a demonstration of our spirituality. If we are afraid or uncertain, the faith and confidence that comes to us as we seek the Savior's guidance and protection is a direct result of our spirits being strong. When we have sinned, we humble ourselves and turn immediately to the Lord for forgiveness. Each time we turn to the Savior, through prayer, scriptures, and obedience we demonstrate and strengthen our spirituality. Each time He answers us, the help comes by way of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have learned that spirituality is not necessarily having visions and dreams, although it might be. It is not necessarily emotional, although emotion might occasionally accompany a spiritual experience. It is not based on grand events alone, but rather on a daily flow of the spirit as we turn consistently to our Savior. It is the sweet, quiet whisperings of the Spirit. It is reaching to heaven in every need, every emotion. It is gratitude. It is joy and it is sorrow. In short, it is or at least can be in all of us if we live our lives in such a way that we can experience it--if we constantly turn to the Savior.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />And this is what spirituality feels like. It is a softening of the heart, a bending of our will to the will of our Heavenly Father. It is a gladness of heart and a feeling of peace even in the midst of trials. It is a hope for the future and the confidence of faith as we move forward into the unknown because we know it is what Heavenly Father wants us to do. It is the desire to serve others. It is a brightness of spirit and a fullness of gratitude for all we have. It is love and it is beauty.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now as you measure your spirituality against these sweet expressions, you will see that while you may not have visions and dream dreams or hear voices from heaven, you have had tiny, and sometimes even big, miracles every day in your life. You have felt the tender mercies that come from a loving Heavenly Father. You have felt a burning testimony in your heart. You have had answers to your prayers and you have felt the Spirit guiding you. You are experiencing spirituality in your life--sometimes more and sometimes less. May we remember the sweet moments we have with the Spirit. May these memories compel us to focus ourselves ever more fully on the Savior, doing faithfully the things that will take us there. Remember His promise: "Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me..." (Doctrine and Covenants 88:63)&nbsp;<br /><br />If any of us have strayed from that straight and narrow path, if our grasp on the rod of iron seems to be slipping just a little bit, we can decide today to get back on, grab hold of the rod, and begin moving forward in our life again. And in time, our grasp will become so strong that the rod of iron will no longer run along side of us, but rather, it will run through the very center of our being holding us upright and true as we draw ever closer to our Savior and Redeemer.&nbsp;<br /><br />And, we do not have to do this alone. He will help us all the way. He knows each of us. He loves us. I had a special witness of this just the other day. It was a moment of deep spirituality for me. I was vacuuming, mulling over in my mother's mind all of the challenges members of my family are facing right now. Okay, I was worrying a little as mothers will. And I happened to look up at a picture on the wall of my son. Whenever I look at this picture I have particularly sweet, tender feelings because he is the son that we lost in an accident just three years ago at the age of 34. But this day, as I looked up and saw him, words came instantly into my mind so clearly, I could almost hear his voice saying to me, "Mom, everything is going to be alright, because He loves us more than you can even know." And I knew that he knew this because he has felt the arms of the Savior around him. He has looked into his face. He has gone ahead of us and has experienced things that we all long to experience. He understands, better than we do, life in the eternal perspective.&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify that our Savior does live. He is our Savior and Redeemer. We can each feel His love. May we focus our lives more on Him and turn to Him in all things. May we each recognize and enjoy the blessings of rich, sweet spirituality in our lives, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for raising your scriptures and showing the Lord your preparation and your willingness to be taught. Let's turn to Matthew 26. While you are turning there, let me invite you to follow along each time I use the scriptures.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, in Matthew 26 we find that it is the eve of the crucifixion. In a very short time, Jesus with the 11 faithful apostles will cross over to Gethsemane, where the Savior of mankind will suffer so intensely that he will "tremble because of pain" and "bleed at every pore" (Doctrine and Covenants 19:18). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But that suffering is still a little ways off. They are gathered in an upper room in Jerusalem to eat the Passover meal. As they eat, Jesus announces in verse 21 that "one of you shall betray me." In the next verse Matthew records that thy "began every one of them to say unto him, 'Lord, is it I?'"&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Boyd K. Packer, in 1965, made the following profound observation. He said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It has always been interesting to me that they did not on that occasion, nudge one another and say, 'I'll bet that it is old Judas. He has been acting [strange] lately.' It reflects something of their stature... rather it is recorded that: 'they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, 'Lord, is it I?'"</p>
<p>&nbsp;President Packer goes on to say:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Would you, I plead, overrule the tendency to disregard counsel and assume for just a moment something apostolic in attitude at least, and ask yourself these questions:&nbsp; Do I need to improve myself?&nbsp; Should I take the counsel to heart and act upon it?&nbsp; If there is one weak or failing, unwilling to follow the brethren, Lord, is it I?"<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;As you listen today, don't let yourself say: "Man, I wish my roommate was here listening to this." Or, "Oh, I know exactly who Brother Wahlquist is talking about!" Instead, ask yourself: "Lord, is it I?" "Lord, is it I who needs to change?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Nearly 20 years I go, while I was teaching seminary in the small town of Parowan, Utah, I had a dream that changed my life. Now I must add that most of my dreams are silly little things that I can't even remember in the morning. But this seemed different and I certainly remembered it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I was teaching the Doctrine and Covenants that year. It was near the end of the school year and the next day I would be teaching Section 133 about the Lord's second coming. Go ahead and turn to Section 133.&nbsp;<br /><br />I had gone to bed with the famous Harry Anderson painting of the Savior's second coming on my mind. This is the same picture that Elder Neil L. Andersen referred to in the April 2011 General Conference. Here are a few of the verses from Section 133. Notice the verbs, the action words. These are invitations from the Lord to act and a warning not to wait until we are acted upon (2 Nephi 2:14, 26).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verse 4: "prepare ye, prepare ye, O my people..."<br />Verse 5: "Go ye out from Babylon. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord."<br />Verse 6: "...And let every man call upon the name of the Lord."<br />Verse 10: "...Awake and arise and go forth to meet the Bridegroom..."<br />Verse 11: "Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour..."<br />Verse 15: "...let all things be prepared before you..."<br />Verse 16: "Hearken and hear, O ye inhabitants of the earth..."<br />Verse 19: "Wherefore, prepare ye for the coming of the Bridegroom; go ye, go ye out to meet him." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to sleep with these action words in my mind. "Go." "Prepare." "Be." "Call." "Awake." "Arise." "Watch." "Hearken." "Hear." That's where my dream comes in. I dreamed that it was the second coming. I was on standing on the front porch of our red brick, east-facing home. I was there with my wife Michelle and my two oldest children, Michael and Jessica. They were, at the time, my only two children.&nbsp;<br /><br />In my dream, I saw something glorious in the distance. It was coming from the east and high up in the clouds. All of a sudden, Michelle, who was holding Jessica in one arm and holding hands with Michael, began gracefully floating up to meet the Savior. As I stood there watching, an overwhelming feeling of love and peace came over me. There was the woman I love and my children being "caught up" to meet the Lord "and received into the cloud" (Doctrine and Covenants 76:102). They were focused on Him. His glory seemed to encompass them. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was so caught up in the sublime scene that it was some time before it dawned on me that I was still standing on my front porch. Perhaps the Lord hadn't noticed me? So I began to gently rock back and forth. Nothing! I was still standing on my front porch. So I thought, "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:17). So I began jumping into the air, thinking that once I got air borne I would keep going until I caught up with Michelle and the kids. But each time I leapt into the air, I came solidly back down to the ground.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then something very frightening dawned on me. Michelle and the kids had not even looked back. They had no idea I was still standing on the front porch. They were so focused on the Savior that I was a forgotten memory.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was at this point I looked down from the skies and noticed, for the first time, this giant wall of fire in the distance. It was rolling towards me. I began to jump up in earnest now. Nothing! Each time I simply came back down to the cement porch. I looked at Michelle one last time. I felt the heat of the rolling wall of fire. I awoke!&nbsp;<br /><br />I lay in my bed covered in sweat. My legs were sore and cramping. I rolled over, woke Michelle, and told her about my dream. Now, I don't know what I expected her to say, but what she said cut me to the bone. After listening to me tell her about my dream, Michelle said, "Sounds like you'd better repent." Then she rolled over and went back to sleep.&nbsp;<br /><br />While sleep came to her almost instantly--a blessing of a righteous life--sleep would not come to me for the rest of that night. I ended up getting up, going into the other room, and with paper and pencil (paper and pencil are very old versions of the iPad) I began making a list all of my flaws, faults, imperfections, and, yes, sins. It was a long list.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Why was I writing? I have learned the value of writing down inspiration. Elder Richard G. Scott stressed the importance of writing down inspiration as it comes. He said: "I believe that you can leave the most precious, personal direction of the Spirit unheard because you do not respond to, record, and apply the first promptings that come to you."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />So under the direction of the Spirit, I made my long list of needed changes. I began to feel overwhelmed. I realized that I was not yet the kind of man Heavenly Father would have me be. Michelle was right. "I'd better repent!" I had postponed, put off, and ignored improvements in my life long enough. The dream reminded me that now "is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors" (Alma 34:32). There were course corrections I needed to make in my life and it was past time to start.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would ask you to ask yourself: "Lord, is it I? Am I like Brother Wahlquist? Have I delayed needed changes in my life?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Both that night and many nights since, I have spent hours on my knees. My list was so long. Where would I start? How could I possibly overcome all of my weaknesses? I admit to feeling overwhelmed! But, over time, I began to realize the truthfulness of a statement that President Henry B. Eyring would make:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"My experience has taught me this about how people and organizations improve: the best place to look is for small changes we could make in things we do often.&nbsp; There is power in steadiness and repetition. And if we can be led by inspiration to choose the right small things to change, consistent obedience will bring great improvement."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;What a novel idea. I could make small changes in things I do often. We could all do that. Because we do something often, the small change will make, to borrow a phrase from Elder Neal A. Maxwell, "a destinational difference."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />To demonstrate how the principle taught by President Eyring works, let me start with a "non-salvational" example: we brush our teeth. Hopefully it is something "we do often." If you want fewer cavities, healthier teeth, a brighter smile, and probably more dates, you could make a small change in the way you brush your teeth. Perhaps you might brush with better strokes, or better toothpaste, or a little longer. It will make a difference in the health of your teeth and probably the health of your relationships. Now, President Eyring is not alone in his suggestion to make small "course corrections."&nbsp;<br /><br />In 2008 President Dieter F. Uchtdorf told us the story of a jet carrying 257 people that crashed into the side of Mt. Erebus in Antarctica. Their instruments were off by a mere two degrees, resulting in 28-mile error and the tragic deaths of all aboard. President Uchtdorf said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Small errors and minor drifts away from the doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ can bring sorrowful consequences into our lives. It is therefore of critical importance that we become self-disciplined enough to make early and decisive corrections to get back on the right track and not wait or hope that errors will somehow correct themselves. The longer we delay corrective action, the larger the needed changes become, and the longer it takes to get back on the correct course-even to the point where a disaster might be looming."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;"Lord, is it I? Do I need to make small course corrections? Am I off by even a few degrees? Am I going down a path that may lead to disaster?" Remember, as President Eyring said:&nbsp; If we can be "led by inspiration to choose the right small things to change" it will make great improvement. It will make all the difference in eternity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For more than nine years I was a pre-service trainer, meaning my job was to help find, teach, and train those who wanted to be full-time seminary teachers for the Church. One day I was sitting in the back of a classroom watching a young man teach seminary. He asked a great question. I could tell this could be a wonderful conversation with the class. A student raised his hand to answer. The answer he gave was: "I could really pray." Another student said, "We could study our scriptures." A third student replied, "I think the answer is church."&nbsp;<br /><br />The teacher quickly said, "Enough! I don't want the 'Primary' answers. I don't want the 'Sunday School' answers. I want real answers!" To him, and to you, I suggest, those are the real answers. Just last week, Sister Lant reminded us of these things. They are salvational.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Salvational Principle 1: Say your prayers<br />Salvational Principle 2: Read your scriptures<br />Salvational Principle 3: Go to church</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now I ask, "Lord, is it I? Do I need to improve in any or all of these areas?" "Can I make small changes-small course corrections-in the way I pray, study scriptures, and attend church?" Let's take a few minutes with each of these marvelous principles.&nbsp;<br /><br />Salvational Principle 1: Say your prayers. I have found three aspects of praying, that if adopted or fine-tuned, could make a huge difference in our lives. I testify that by doing these things, it has made a huge difference in my life. My three prayer suggestions are: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Consistently say your morning prayers<br />Find a place and a way to say your personal prayers out loud<br />Pray using Thee, Thou, Thy, and Thine</p>
<p>Prayer Suggestion 1: Consistently say your morning prayers. While all prayer is important, I believe that morning prayers are perhaps the most important prayers we say. In the mornings, as we awake and approach our day, we will be making decisions: dealing with people, traveling, dating, studying, changing majors, shopping, and serving others. We need the Lord's help and the Lord's blessings as we "act and are being acted upon (2 Nephi 2:26).&nbsp;<br /><br />Did you know Jesus was a "morning pray-er?" Turn to Mark 1. Notice in verses 32 and 33 that starting in the evening; they brought all the sick of the city to his door to be healed. It must have gone on well into the night. Surely Jesus had earned a bit of a "lay-in." Yet in verse 35 we read: "And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed." If we are "trying to be like Jesus" we need to learn to say our morning prayers. I testify that morning prayers make a real difference in our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I ask: "Lord, is it I? Do I need be better at praying in the morning?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Prayer Suggestion 2: Find a place and a way to say your personal prayers out loud. I learned this lesson one morning while I was saying my morning prayers in Vernal, Utah. I was kneeling down on a bath rug pleading for the Lord's help in teaching a lesson on being a consistent disciple of the Savior. A thought came to my mind for an object lesson. My mind began to race. Did we have all the ingredients? Was the store open? Could I do it in time for first hour? Would Michelle care if I took stuff from her kitchen? As I ran through all the things I needed, this thought hit me: "Brother Wahlquist, you are in the middle of a prayer."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I didn't see or hear anything, but in my mind, I imagined a loving Heavenly Father, sort of leaning forward on his throne, as if listening intently to my every word. I had called him. I had pleaded: "Heavenly Father, are you really there?" His attention was fully focused on me and I had put Him, the God of this universe, on hold while my mind wandered off. Then and there, I determined that I would always try to say my personal prayers out loud so that I would not let my mind wander off. I testify that praying out loud has made a difference in my personal prayers.&nbsp;<br /><br />I invite you to find a place and a way to say your personal prayers out loud. You might be thinking: "It is impossible to pray out loud in my apartment." Brothers and sisters, be a "can do" person. Every one of your roommates has ecclesiastical endorsement to be here at BYU-Idaho. If you were to ask kindly, I'm sure they would give you a moment in your bedroom to pray. You can find a way! &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Did you know it is actually a commandment to pray out loud? In Doctrine and Covenants 19:28 we read: "And again, I command thee that thou shalt pray vocally as well as in thy heart..." Now, I don't know all that goes on when we keep the commandment to pray out loud. &nbsp;I believe Heavenly Father wants to hear our voice. I believe it is a private conversation. I believe Heavenly Father wants us to talk to him. He commands us to talk to him. I also know that with the commandment to pray vocally, that "God giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them" (1 Nephi 3:7).&nbsp;<br /><br />"Lord, is it I? Do I need be better at letting Heavenly Father hear my voice by praying out loud?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Prayer Suggestion 3: Learn to speak the language of God: Thee, Thou, Thy, and Thine. Elder Dallin H. Oaks invites us to learn "the special language of prayer...thee, thou, thy, and thine... Men and women who wish to show respect will take time to learn the special language of prayer."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I'm sure you, with me, want to show our Heavenly Father that we love him enough to incorporate this small change into the common activity of saying our prayers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If you don't know how to use the language of prayer, I suggest you study the first 11 verses of Doctrine and Covenants 112. You will find more than 37 examples of Thee, Thou, Thy, and Thine in just 11 verses. With a small amount of effort, you can effectively learn to use these sacred words in your prayers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Lord, is it I? Do I need to be better at using the sacred language of prayer?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, on to Salvational Principle 2: scripture study. My three scripture suggestions are:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Read every day<br />Read at the same time<br />Before you read, make sure you pray</p>
<p>Some of my students may be hoping that I will sing the little song I wrote about scripture reading. Not going to happen. You should all be grateful!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scripture Suggestion 1: Read every day. A friend of mine who has passed away always called the scriptures: "Love notes from home." I like that. Why should we read scriptures every day? Elder Howard W. Hunter promised that: "It is certain that one who studies the scriptures every day accomplishes far more than one who devotes considerable time one day and then lets days go by before continuing."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Consider that scripture reading is food for the soul. You certainly would not have good physical health if you only ate once a week or once every few days. I don't believe you can have good spiritual health unless you "feast [daily] upon the words of Christ" (2 Nephi 32:3). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Lord, is it I? Do I need to be more consistent at reading the scriptures every day? Do I need to feed my spirit as well (or perhaps better) than I feed my body?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Scripture Suggestion 2: Read at the same time. President Hunter goes on to say:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Not only should we study each day, but there should be a regular time set aside when we can concentrate without interference. Many find that the best time to study is in the morning after a night's rest has cleared the mind or the many cares that interrupt thought. Others prefer to study in the quiet hours after the work and worries of the day are over and brushed aside, thus ending the day with a peace and tranquility that comes by communion with the scriptures."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;In other words, what is best for one person may not be the best for another person. Don't get hung up arguing which time is best, rather, choose a time and stick to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Lord, is it I? Do I need to have a more consistent time to study the scriptures?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Scripture Suggestion 3: Pray before you read your scriptures. Always pray before you read. More than 20 times in the scriptures, the Lord invites us to "pray always." I'm sure you can see the wisdom of praying before you study your scriptures. Elder Dallin H. Oaks reminds us that part of our careful study of the scriptures should be to "prayerfully seek personal revelation to know their meaning for [ourselves]."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />"Lord, is it I? Do I need to be better at praying before I study the scriptures?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, Salvational Principle 3: Go to church.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Go to church to worship the Savior<br />Leave the world out of Sabbath worship<br />Expect sacrament meetings to be a spiritual feast</p>
<p>&nbsp;Go to Church Suggestion 1: Go to church to worship the Savior. The phrase, "go to church" needs to change. Going to church implies a physical action of moving your body to a different location. We go to church often. At this university, we "go to church" or your ecclesiastical endorsement hangs in the balance. I suggest we stop "going to church." I don't want us to stop attending our meetings. I am suggesting that we start worshiping or that we polish our worshiping at church, rather than merely "going" to church. We can make several small changes in order to insure that we worship Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the April 2011 General Conference, just three short months ago, Elder L. Tom Perry reminded us that: "the pattern of Sabbath day observance must always include worship."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;When a prophet, seer, and revelator uses an absolute like "always" we should sit up and take note. "The pattern of Sabbath day observance must always include worship." Always! So here are some questions we might consider. What does it mean to worship? Did you feel like you worshiped Christ last Sunday? How can we better worship Heavenly Father on the Sabbath day?&nbsp;<br /><br />My friends, the purpose of church is to worship. We must get better at worshiping the Lord on His holy day (Doctrine and Covenants 59:9).&nbsp;<br /><br />"Lord, is it I? Do I attend church with the purest of motives? Do I come to church in the spirit of worship? Am I caught up in impressing the wrong people at church? How can I better worship the Father and the Son?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Suggestion 2: Leave the world out of Sabbath worship. In 2008, Elder Dallin H. Oaks reminded us that sacrament meeting:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...is not a time for conversation or transmission of messages...refrain from all other activities, especially from behavior that could interfere with the worship of others... It is not a time for whispered conversations on cell phones or for texting... When we partake of the sacrament, we make a sacred covenant that we will always remember the Savior. How sad to see persons obviously violating that covenant in the very meeting where they are making it."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;Brothers and sisters, we have been taught by a prophet of God to put aside the world during this sacred meeting. King Benjamin says that if we have been taught and we still "go contrary to that which has been spoken" that we are in "open rebellion against God"&nbsp; (Mosiah 2: 36-37). Perhaps we should remember how the Lord feels about open rebellion. Do you remember when the Lord opened up the earth and swallowed the three rebels in Numbers 16?Perhaps we should remember that, the next time we are playing "Angry Chickens" during sacrament meeting. That's my 7-year-old Lilli's title for "Angry Birds."&nbsp;<br /><br />"Lord, is it I? Do I need to be better at keeping the world out of my Sabbath worship? Do I need to work harder to stay focused on the Savior during sacrament meeting?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Suggestion 3: Expect sacrament meeting to be a spiritual feast. Sacrament meetings are most sacred. Elder Oaks said: "The ordinance of the sacrament makes the sacrament meeting the most sacred and important meeting in the Church."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I invite you to ponder 3 Nephi 26:13. "Therefore, I would that ye should behold that the Lord truly did teach the people, for the space of three days; and after that he did show himself unto them oft, and did break bread oft, and bless it, and give it unto them."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope I'm not reading too much into that verse, but it appears to me that we just read that Jesus came to the Book of Mormon saints, three days in a row. Then it appears that he continued to "show himself" often. The text does not say whether these visits were announced or if He just sort of popped in. But it is clear that each time He came, it turned into a sacramental experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to invite you to consider attending sacrament meetings with the hope that the Savior may show up! How would your preparation change if you anticipated the Savior being there? Would you come early? Would you dress differently? Would you sing better? Now I don't know if or when the Savior will come to your sacrament meeting, but I testify that His spirit can be felt in all sacrament meetings.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Lord, is it I? Do I need to have greater spiritual expectations for sacrament meeting? Do I need to change my preparation for sacrament meeting?"&nbsp;<br /><br />In conclusion, I invite you to follow the Spirit to make small changes in the things you do often. Begin today! I testify that small changes make a big difference in our lives. As we strive to become better men and women, we will be better prepared for the glorious return of the Savior to the earth. I testify that as we fine-tune our prayers, our scripture study, and our Sabbath worship, that the Spirit will fill our lives more abundantly. This I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify of the divinity of Jesus Christ. He is the Son of God. He is the Savior of the world. He is the Redeemer of us all. I testify Joseph Smith was called of God to restore the true church upon the earth. I testify President Thomas S. Monson is a living prophet of the Lord on the earth today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Years ago, I read a magazine article about a European basketball player not of our faith. He was receiving press not only for his excellent basketball skills but for his somewhat curious goal. He wanted to be a saint. I was intrigued, as was the writer of the article who wondered what would prompt such a desire. I have thought of this goal many times through the years and remembered it recently as my family and I visited family graves in the Lehi, Utah cemetery.<br /><br />My mother-in-law, Linda, likes to walk with my children to this cemetery to help them feel connected to their ancestors. She has long been impressed by the inscription on one particular headstone for her great-great grandfather. Chiseled into the rock, beneath his name and dates, are these simple words: "He died a Latter-day Saint." As Linda has taught my children of her desire to be worthy to have this sentiment engraved on her own headstone one day, I have pondered what it means to die a Latter-day Saint, or for that matter, to live as one.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are many general definitions for a saint, ranging from "a person who has died and gone to heaven" to "an extremely virtuous person," including those who, in other religious traditions, are venerated and even canonized, to "a member of any of various religious groups, especially Latter-day Saints."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;By this definition, you and I are all Saints by virtue of our membership in the Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, I believe my mother-in-law is referring to this additional definition in the Bible Dictionary when she speaks of being worthy of the appellation of "saint":&nbsp; "The word&nbsp;<em>saint</em>&nbsp;is a translation of a Greek word also rendered "holy," the fundamental idea being that of consecration or separation for a sacred purpose; but since what was set apart for God must be without blemish, the word came to mean "free from blemish," whether physical or moral. In the New Testament, the saints are all those who by baptism have entered into the Christian covenant."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />So, to be identified as a Latter-day Saint is not a slight thing. It means we have chosen to be baptized and not, as others might think, so that we can have a church membership certificate. We are baptized so that we can become covenant makers and ultimately covenant keepers. Then, claiming the blessings that accompany the baptismal covenant, we embark on a quest to become holy, consecrated and pure, to become like God. Such a quest will certainly require courage and gratitude to our Savior and help from the Holy Spirit, but I know it is possible.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know it is possible, in part, because of so many faithful Saints who have gone before us. Last August, my family and I had the privilege and joy of traveling to many Church history sites, including Nauvoo, Carthage and Liberty Jails, Independence, Adam-ondi-Ahman, and Far West, and last month I trekked with members of our ward to handcart pioneer sites in Wyoming, including Martin's Cove, Sixth Crossing, and Rock Creek Hollow. It is hard for me to adequately articulate what I felt in these sites, but it was wonderful. In many instances, I felt the very ground was made holy by the faith and sacrifice of the Saints who toiled and lived and died there. I will refer to many of their stories today because it is my conviction that these early Saints and pioneers are "our people," whether or not you may be related to them. They are connected to us because we all belong to the Lord's covenant family.&nbsp;<br /><br />In our few minutes together this afternoon, I'd like to talk about four things I believe we must do to become Saints. They are:</p>
<p><strong>Claim&nbsp;</strong><strong>the Blessings of Belonging</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Principle 1: We claim the blessings of belonging when we obey and then fully participate. In 1 Nephi 17:35 we read: "Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one." There is no quota, no cap on the number of His children He can let in to heaven. He has room for all of us. He loves every one of us with a pure love, and He pleads with us to come follow Him, and to repent and be baptized. Even when we sin and incur His just anger, the scriptures teach us that "his hand is stretched out still" (Isaiah 5:25) and that-and I love this imagery--he desires to gather us to Him "as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if (we) will repent and return. . .with full purpose of heart" (3 Nephi 10:6). This is the reason that my son in Mississippi and your loved ones throughout the world are preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ: to invite all to come unto Him, to repent and to be baptized.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we accept this invitation and obey, a wonderful thing occurs. We are blessed. The second half of 1 Nephi 17:35 explains this: "he that is righteous is favored of God." I don't believe this means that God likes some of us better than others; it means that He can favor or bless us when we obey and make covenants with Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I think of John Reber, one of the first converts in the Bern region of Switzerland, who learned this lesson firsthand. He had a physical condition that caused him to "lean. . .heavily on two crutches, his hands warped and misshapen with rheumatism, and a great hump on his back." However, being converted on occasion of a dream and the accompanying teachings of the missionaries, he chose to be baptized. Mary Ann Stucki, who later became John's wife, remembers the day:&nbsp;</p>
<p>While John's physical healing was remarkable, even more important were the covenant blessings John received, first at his baptism and later in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City when he unexpectedly died 12 days after his marriage to Mary Ann in a wagon accident.&nbsp;<br /><br />I wonder how often we ponder just how blessed we are to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is no accident that we begin our journey to sainthood by being baptized as a member of the Church in a local ward or branch. That unit becomes, in essence, our experiential laboratory, a sort of "Saint school" where we can participate, where we can learn and grow and help one another. Certainly, life in any family, even a ward family, has sometimes clumsy, clueless, even messy moments as we work to smooth out our rough edges. But all of us are blessed immensely by the principle of a lay ministry, by the fact that when we belong to the Church we are asked to serve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This starts early. I was called to be the Primary pianist while I was still in Primary, and I remember giving 2 &frac12; minute talks as a young girl in Sunday School. These experiences are not unusual, although the specifics of our callings vary. The beauty is in the fact that we all have opportunities to learn and grow. You may have noticed, however, that callings come at all kinds of moments, whether we feel prepared or not, available or not, skilled or not. I think of those mission calls to early Saints and am always amazed at the faith of the men for going, and of the women for supporting them and assuming the care of their children, homesteads, and animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You may have also noticed that some callings go on for a very long time, even a lifetime. As a result, you may occasionally desire to become anonymous, to melt into the framework, to sit on the back row and hope no one notices you or asks you to speak in church. Perhaps you know what I'm talking about. But when we answer a call to serve or an invitation to participate, amazing things can happen.&nbsp;<br /><br />My two youngest sons learned this for themselves a year or so ago when our stake president issued an invitation to all stake members to participate in a special fast. A member of our stake needed an organ transplant and was undergoing a difficult, critical surgery. The needed organ was being flown from Hawaii, and the lengthy surgery was delayed. Meanwhile, my boys fasted. Ten-year-old Spencer had a basketball game that day, and he threw himself around the court displaying great defensive hustle. When the game ended, although he was hungry, he remembered that he was fasting and didn't complain. The next morning, the boys checked with their dad for a progress report on our friend. When told that we had no news yet, they refused to eat, insisting on fasting until they knew this man was out of surgery. It was a sweet moment for us as a family. Nathan and Spencer could feel the power of participating with other stake members in a holy purpose, and it was tangible to them. They learned that willing participation blesses us and others in ways that may not even be visible, just felt. They learned it is an absolute privilege to participate.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is truly beauty and sweetness in being associated with righteous Saints, a sociality that we're taught will rise with us, although it will then be coupled with eternal glory (Doctrine and Covenants 130:2). I think the Apostle Paul understood this-he had certainly known a different life as rebellious Saul--and I love the way he consistently addressed his fellow saints throughout his epistles. Consider his words in Romans 1:7-9, 11-12:</p>
<p>I love those verses. You can feel the warmth of the relationship between Paul and the Roman saints in them, of Paul's desire to pray for and build and edify his fellow saints. If you pause for a moment to think of all of those who have blessed you during your membership in the Church, those who have imparted unto you of their spiritual gifts, I believe you will be quietly stunned. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In my mind's eye, I can see a veritable lineup of Saints who have loved, taught, mentored and supported me through the years. They range from faithful home teachers to a dad who has taught me the meaning of sacrifice, to my rock-solid husband and dear children, to sweet Relief Society sisters by the score. One is representative of the others. I had called her one day a little frazzled. I had been canning tomatoes for hours when my small children and baby, in particular, could not take another moment and needed their mom. Fearing the tomatoes would spoil if left another day, I phoned her and asked her if she could use them. "Sure," she said.&nbsp;<br /><br />She popped down to pick them up, promptly took them home, canned for several more hours, and returned them to me in shiny-jarred splendor. I was stunned. To this day a jar of home-canned tomatoes makes me think of her and her selfless gift, and I ask you: "Who does that?" But I already know the answer. She did. And you do. I thank all of you who have offered your encouragement and prayers to me in my assignment today, including the young man I didn't recognize in his bike helmet in the gardens last Thursday. I have felt the power of every one of those prayers, and I understand that it is not only that you're such nice people; it is that you are covenant-keepers. What a blessing it is to belong and to be surrounded by your faith and goodness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>"Take" Courage to Keep Covenants</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Principle 2: It takes courage to keep covenants. Think of Noah and Esther and Daniel, of Captain Moroni and Helaman. Our beloved hymn, "Come, Come, Ye Saints" teaches this truth to all who would be Saints: "Why should we think to earn a great reward if we now shun the fight? Gird up your loins; fresh courage take. Our God will never us forsake." &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is so easy to just coast through life, to let others do the "heavy lifting" while we sit back and observe, with plenty of time to criticize. Yet true Saints have always chosen a better, if more difficult path, displaying valiant bravery when faced with fear, danger and hardship.&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Smith endured tremendous persecution because he "had seen a vision . . . knew it, knew that God knew it, and . . . could not deny it" &nbsp;(Joseph Smith-History 1:25). I felt his courage when I stood on the steps of the Johnson home in Hiram, Ohio, where, the morning after being tarred and feathered by a mob, he preached a sermon to some of the very men who had attacked him. When I think of upholding the baptismal covenant to "bear one another's burdens, that they may be light" (Mosiah 18:8).&nbsp;<br /><br />I think of Levi Savage, a member of the Willie handcart company. After expressing his concern that the handcart company was leaving too late in the season, Levi nonetheless supported the decision of the captain and the other Saints. He assumed leadership for 100 persons in the company, and worked tirelessly to aid them. In the difficult river crossings, he was often the first in the water and the last one out. A fellow traveler said of him: "No man worked harder than he to alleviate the suffering which he had foreseen."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Today, we are not called to push handcarts, but we are called to have "faith in every footstep" and this requires consistent, daily courage. David O. McKay taught: "We have greater responsibility than ever to learn and to live the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We have greater tasks before us. The final work is not all done yet. ... We need courage to enter into those new realms; we need courage to meet our present situations and conditions..."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe we need courage to do our level best even though we might be afraid or have challenges to overcome. We need courage to resist apathy and refuse to wait for some perfect future day, a different circumstance or a better opportunity. We need courage to develop skills and educate mind, heart and spirit, to stretch ourselves in our academic classrooms. And, as an academic advisor, I believe we can do even better there. You are so capable, with so much potential! We need courage to resist or overcome addiction and temptation and choose a better way. I testify that the Lord is preparing each of us to be useful and used in His kingdom. If we fully engage-advance, not retreat--and do the best we can right now, this day and each future day, He will use us in repeated, even unexpected ways. He will know He can depend on us, and we can be ready at any time to respond to a call for service.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Ephraim Hanks learned this in 1856 when he responded to the voice of a messenger in his bedroom and then to the prophet Brigham Young and participated in one of the greatest rescue missions in the Church's history, coming to the aid of those stranded handcart companies who were caught in early, heavy snows. In addition to the temporal relief he brought in the form of meat from two recently slaughtered buffalo and the skill of hunting he employed on the way home to feed the starving Saints, he also brought the gift of healing, using his priesthood power to bless and heal dozens and bring comfort to many others.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition to "taking" courage, we can give courage; that is, we can encourage or inspire courage in others. We are all in this together, and it is so important to look for the good in others. Why does this take courage? Because it is so much easier, and often more popular, to do otherwise. It takes more time and careful thought to build than it does to destroy. Did any of you observe the razing of the Smith Annex-it took about a day-and the subsequent building of the Manwaring Center-which took many months? You have all known someone you would term a "builder," the man or woman in your ward or our BYU-Idaho community who makes you better when they walk in a room. You can feel their goodness. They always have something nice to say about you. In fact, they think you're so wonderful that you always act your best around them because to do otherwise would seem criminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If you consider the fact that all covenants we make with our Father in Heaven involve and affect other people, we will realize how much we need one another. We cannot get back to heaven alone. Indeed, what would heaven be if we were in solitary confinement? That would be no heaven at all. Sister Lucy Mack Smith taught: "We must cherish one another, watch over one another, comfort one another and gain instruction that we may all sit down in heaven together."<sup>7</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>I think Emily Hill, a handcart pioneer, understood the principle of cherishing and watching over another. As she and her sister Julia struggled over Rocky Ridge in terrible conditions-in a 27-hour, 15-mile march-they were in desperate straits. Julia's granddaughter later shared this dream she had about the sisters: &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"I could see Julia and Emily stranded in the snow on the windy summit of Rocky Ridge with the rest of the Willie handcart company. They had no heavy clothing to keep them warm. Julia was sitting in the snow, shaking. She could not carry on. Emily, who was freezing as well, knew that if she did not help Julia stand up, Julia would die. As Emily wrapped her arms around her sister to help her up, Julia began to cry-but no tears came, only soft whimpering sounds. Together they walked slowly to their handcart. Thirteen died that terrible night. Julia and Emily survived.<sup>"8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We must watch over one another. It's how we will survive the difficulties and challenges of our day. As we genuinely lift and praise and build one another, we contribute to the sort of righteous sociality we all long for, in this life and the next.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Access the Atonement by Giving our All</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Principle 3: We gain access to the Atonement by giving our all. It is, of course, impossible to become a Saint without the intercession of our Savior, Jesus Christ. His incomparable Atonement made it possible for each of us to become clean--free of blemish. In order to fully access His grace, we must give Him our whole hearts. I appreciate this insight from C.S. Lewis:</p>
<p>Again, 3<sup>&nbsp;</sup>Nephi 10:6 teaches us that, to be gathered to our Savior, we must "repent and return with full purpose of heart." Anything less than our all, than full purpose of heart, will never be enough. Anything less will always result in our being unhappy, either feeling guilty or impoverished.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I think about what it means to be in this "third class" of men, I think of Saints who have given their all in building up the kingdom of God on the earth. I am so moved by the story of handcart pioneer James Kirkwood. An 11-year-old boy from Glasgow, Scotland, he traveled to Zion in the Willie company with his mother and three brothers. His older brother Robert was crippled, so his mother Margaret and 19-year-old brother Thomas pushed Robert in the handcart. That left James with the charge to care for his 4-year-old brother, Joseph, on the climb over the 7,300-foot Rocky Ridge. This was the same terrible night that Emily and Julia Hill endured, and it was a 15-mile journey that took 27 hours for most. On that night, James fell behind the rest of the party, carrying his little brother. I can see him trying to warm his freezing hands, shifting the weight of his brother on his back. When the pair finally arrived at the campfire that night, James set his brother down and then died from exhaustion and exposure, literally giving his life for his brother.<sup>10</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup><sup><br /></sup><sup><br /></sup>I am so inspired by James. How can I be casual or uncommitted if I expect to go where I believe he now is? Why should we think to earn a great reward if we now shun the fight? His story teaches me that to truly be a saint I must surrender my will to God in whatever way He asks of me.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Seek the Sanctifying Influence of the Holy Ghost</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Principle 4: We must seek the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit. Another reason that the journey to sainthood begins with baptism is because after the baptism by water comes the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost plays a critical role in preparing us for heaven. He fulfills many roles, including Comforter, Revelator, Testator, and one of his jobs is to be a Purifier or Sanctifier. Alma&nbsp; 13:12 teaches this truth:</p>
<p>Because it is the Holy Spirit's influence that ultimately sanctifies us and makes us pure, we must seek to have Him with us. Therefore, we must go to places where He is. We must create homes and lives where His influence can be felt. Each time we qualify by our choices to commune with the Holy Spirit He purifies us, making us a little more holy, a little more clean, a bit more truly "Saint-like." It is the Holy Ghost who ultimately "justifies" us by certifying our righteous behaviors and sealing us His. Ironically, when we seek to justify ourselves it is almost always when we know we are doing less than we ought, when we do not qualify for the Holy Ghost's presence.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have felt the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost many times in my life. I certainly experienced it in Nauvoo. The temple spire there faces west, in honor of the Saints who left their beloved city to go to Zion. The missionaries in Nauvoo teach that "when you're here, they're here," because as we remember those who've gone before us, we feel connected to them and are blessed by their covenant-keeping lives. I felt it in Rock Creek Hollow where we visited the common grave of 15 pioneers, including young James Kirkwood. The Spirit taught me that it was not death alone that hallowed the ground, for all men die and the graves will all be opened. Rather, it was the noble way that these saints lived while they were dying that sanctified the very earth. I am deeply grateful to these Saints. They have helped me to understand more fully what it means to live and die a Latter-day Saint.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am also grateful for the blessing of being counted with you, my friends and brothers and sisters, as a Latter-day Saint. It is not a slight thing. It is my great desire to live and die as a sanctified Latter-day Saint, and to sit down in heaven with each one of you. I give thanks to my Father in Heaven and to our Savior Jesus Christ for making such a dream possible. That they live and love us and desire to gather us to them is my testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a blessing to be with you in this very special and dedicated place.&nbsp;We have gathered to worship together today, and I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us. We are in this beautiful place that separates us from the commotion in the world and helps us focus on the things of eternity. The world we live in is certainly in commotion. It is turbulent&mdash; filled with natural and man-made disasters; unexpected, dramatic political changes; wrenching shifts in economies; and much uncertainty. It is a world in which evil runs rampant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The commotion in the world is not far away. It is close to us, even in our own families at times.&nbsp;In this difficult, challenging world all of us yearn for peace. We yearn for solace, comfort, and reassurance. &nbsp;We seek a refuge from the storm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The peace we seek is in the &ldquo;merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The promise of peace the Savior makes to us is the same promise He made to His Apostles at the Last Supper: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. &nbsp;Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior&rsquo;s peace is much different and much more than the security, safety, and absence of war and contention the world offers as peace.&nbsp; As Elder M. Russell Ballard taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>" . . . the everlasting peace Jesus promises is an inner peace, born in faith, anchored by testimony, nurtured with love, and expressed through continual obedience and repentance.&nbsp; It is a peace of spirit that echoes through the heart and the soul. . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Peace&mdash;real peace, whole-souled to the very core of your being&mdash;comes only in and through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the peace the Savior offers us is an uplifting feeling of well-being that comes as a gift of the Spirit through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It is a deep assurance born of spiritual knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. It is a gift of eternal perspective that gives true understanding. It is a witness of the Spirit that our sins are remitted and that through the merits, mercy, and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we may qualify for and obtain eternal life. It is peace of conscience, peace of mind, peace of the whole heart and soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That peace only comes through obedience: acting in faith in Jesus Christ to repent of our sins and keep His commandments.&nbsp; In the words of Isaiah, &ldquo;there is no peace . . . [to] the wicked.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The Lord&rsquo;s promise is clear and unmistakable: &ldquo;he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we are true and faithful to our covenants, peace can come in abundance. As Isaiah said of the children of Israel: "O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, think of what the Lord has promised: the peace of Christ can be like a river that flows into our lives. Peace like a river.&nbsp;Peace flows into our lives from the headwaters of obedience. It flows in two channels. The first channel is our inner spiritual life. The second is doing the work of the Lord. These channels are not alternative ways to peace. They are both essential, and they are intimately connected. I want to consider these two channels with you today. Obedience makes the flow of peace possible, but there is much that we must do to open these channels and to keep them open that we might receive the great blessing of peace like a river.</p>
<p><strong><br /> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Channel #1:&nbsp; Our Inner Spiritual Life</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of us comes to earth with the capacity to think, reason, ponder, learn, understand, and comprehend. We are blessed with the capacity to feel love, joy, compassion, forgiveness, reverence, and beauty. We are given the Light of Christ to help us feel what is right and what is wrong. Our thoughts and feelings are spiritual in nature; they define our inner spiritual life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is in that inner spiritual life that the Lord speaks to us. He has commanded us to humble ourselves before Him so that our thoughts and feelings are open to His Spirit: "Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To walk in the meekness of His Spirit is to repent of our sins and act in humility to do His will guided by the Holy Spirit. Such a walk brings the companionship of the Holy Ghost and a flow of heavenly assurance, joy, healing, forgiveness, comfort, divine perspective, understanding, light, and truth. If our thoughts and feelings are open to and in tune with the Holy Ghost, we can receive peace like a river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But these are not the only feelings and thoughts vying for our attention. The natural man in us, the ideas and philosophies of men, the lures of the world, and the wiles of the devil all clamor for a place in our minds and hearts. It is easy to be distracted by the world, easy to be enticed by temptations, easy to be misled by false ideas. Even faithful Latter-day Saints may neglect their spiritual lives. There are so many projects to complete, so many errands to run, so many bills to pay, so many meetings to attend that it is easy to be absorbed in these concerns and neglect the life of the spirit.&nbsp; If we are not very careful and very diligent, this channel of peace may be disrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I suggest three things we can do to open our hearts and minds to the Holy Ghost and to keep that channel of peace open? They are: 1) pray morning and night; 2) study and ponder the scriptures every day; and 3) worship the Father and the Son in holy places&mdash;in our homes and through the sacred ordinances of the sacrament and the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all ought to ask ourselves if we have made these three things a priority in our lives.&nbsp;Do we set aside sufficient time morning and night to pray in faith with real intent, pouring out our souls to God in gratitude and thanksgiving, seeking His help for those in need, asking for His blessings in our families, in our work, and in our callings?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do we devote time to study and ponder the scriptures? Do we &ldquo;treasure up in [our] minds . . . the words of life&rdquo;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;so that we can hear the word of the Lord?&nbsp; Do we write down the impressions we receive and reflect on them?&nbsp;Do we express reverence and love for the Father and the Son in our families, in prayer, in testimony? Do we participate in the ordinance of the sacrament in a spirit of worship, expressing love and reverence for the Son of God, His love and mercy and grace? Do we always remember Him? Do we participate in sacred ordinances and worship in the house of the Lord regularly? Do we &ldquo;let the solemnities of eternity rest upon [our] minds?&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we consistently and diligently do all of these things with real intent, with real desire to communicate with our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, we experience over and over again our true relationship to Them. We go to the Father as His child, seeking His help, totally dependent on Him, thanking Him for His blessings, listening to His words, expressing to Him reverence and love. We go in the name of His Beloved Son relying wholly on His merits, conscious of our need for His mercy and grace, trusting in His redeeming love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are sacred moments. These are moments of revelation. Our Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers. The Savior reaches out to lift and strengthen us, to forgive us and cleanse us of sin. We experience the powers of godliness in the ordinances of salvation. Our faith increases. Our testimonies grow. We learn and understand and see. We feel comfort, assurance, and love. The channel opens, and God blesses us with peace like a river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is especially true in difficult times. There are times when our peace may be disrupted. In fact, there are times when it feels like life conspires to dump a big load of rocks right in the middle of our channel of peace. When that happens, and it will happen to us all, do not take counsel from your fears. Seek the blessings of heaven in prayer, in the scriptures, and in holy places. Act in faith in the Savior, and the channel will reopen; and peace like a river will flow once again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Channel #2:&nbsp; Doing the Work of the Lord</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>The Savior Himself spoke of the second channel, doing the work of the Lord, in these words to His disciples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The yoke of Christ certainly includes the covenants and commandments that are in the gospel of Jesus Christ. But it also includes His work&mdash;&ldquo;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;The work of salvation&mdash;including &ldquo;member missionary work, convert retention, activation of less-active members, temple and family history work, and teaching the gospel&rdquo;<sup>12</sup>&mdash;is the yoke of Christ. When we take upon ourselves that yoke, the Lord promises us &ldquo;rest unto [our] souls.&rdquo;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Doing the work of the Lord is a channel of peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I suggest three things we might do to open this channel of peace? They are: 1)&nbsp;accept and magnify callings in the Church; 2) share the gospel and invite others to act; and 3) act on spiritual impressions to help others.&nbsp;These are simple things prophets have taught from the beginning. We might ask ourselves if these things are ingrained in our lives.&nbsp;Do we accept callings and, as President Monson has taught, faithfully and diligently perform the service they require?&nbsp;Do we share the gospel with those not of our faith or those who may have wandered from the light? Do we reach out to rescue the lost soul?&nbsp;Do we act on the impressions we receive to go on the Lord&rsquo;s errand?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we do these things with the guidance of the Spirit, important things happen to us. Most importantly, the Savior goes with us in His service: "And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face.&nbsp; I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is in His service that we come to know Him. We see and feel how He works. He works through us to bless the lives of others. That is a stretching, humbling experience. It takes us outside of ourselves and helps us focus on the needs of others. Sometimes those needs seem overwhelming. We are called to act in His name, but we are acutely conscious of the fact that we cannot do what He asks alone. The only way forward is to act in faith in Him. And so we pray and get up off our knees and go to work, trusting that He will help us. And He does. He really is with us. His Spirit really is in our hearts, and the angels really are around us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we do simple acts of service like take a meal to someone we visit teach, or walk across the street to invite a less-active neighbor to Relief Society, or teach our Primary class, or give a copy of the Book of Mormon to the man sitting next to us on the airplane, or help a 15-year-old young man in the teacher&rsquo;s quorum who is struggling with pornography, or comfort the young couple we home teach who just lost a three-year-old daughter to cancer, or share testimony of tithing and the law of chastity with a young man investigating the Church, or a thousand other things the Lord wants done, He goes with us. He helps us see those in need as He sees them and feel about them the way He feels about them. We speak words we know come from Him. We discern needs and feel impressions about actions to take that we know are beyond our understanding. What we say and what we do have an impact on those we serve far beyond anything we have done. We feel a love for the people that we know is a spiritual gift; it is the pure love of Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In His service we become witnesses of His love, His mercy, His grace, and His power. Our testimony strengthens. The problems we have, our worries and concerns, are swallowed up in the service of the Lord. The Holy Ghost bears witness of Christ&rsquo;s love for us and His approval of our service. We gain new perspective. We see light and truth. We feel assurance. Our faith in Christ increases; our hope in Him grows; feelings of charity swell within us. The channel opens, and peace flows into our hearts and minds. Peace like a river.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I know that service to the Lord requires hard things. It takes courage to invite someone to hear the gospel. There are disappointments. People say no. Children don&rsquo;t listen. Some people turn away even after the Lord has blessed them and labored with them for a long time. It hurts. When you love someone, you open yourself to the possibility of pain and sorrow. And, of course, those rocks we talked about earlier&mdash;illness, accidents, the world economy, and so forth&mdash;may disrupt our peace. But the way forward, the way to restore peace is to serve the Lord. Serve in your calling. Share the gospel. Listen to the whisperings of the Spirit, and go to those in need. The channel will open and peace will flow&mdash;peace like a river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Abundance of the Lord</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>These two channels of peace&mdash;our inner spiritual life and doing the work of the Lord&mdash;are not separate and independent. Linked and fed by the headwaters of obedience, they are intimately connected. They complement and reinforce one another. When our inner spiritual life is strong, we qualify for the guidance and power of the Holy Spirit in our service to the Lord. Doing the Lord&rsquo;s work sends us to our knees in prayer and into the scriptures. We seek guidance and strength in holy places. Doing the work strengthens our inner spiritual life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fed by the headwaters, the channels of peace reinforce, magnify, and strengthen one another. When both are open and flowing, we experience the abundance of the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We feel a desire to share with others the peace we feel. We are like the people at the temple of Bountiful at the end of the first day of the Savior&rsquo;s visit to them. They went home, but they could not keep what they had experienced to themselves. Listen to what happened:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And it was noised abroad among the people immediately, before it was yet dark, that the multitude had seen Jesus, and that he had ministered unto them, and that he would also show himself on the morrow unto the multitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning Jesus; and insomuch did they send forth unto the people that there were many, yea, an exceedingly great number, did labor exceedingly all that night, that they might be on the morrow in the place where Jesus should show himself unto the multitude."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was the message that was noised abroad?&nbsp;He lives! The resurrected Lord has come. He lives! He taught us, healed us, and ministered unto us and brought peace to our souls! He is real! We saw Him! He is coming back! He is coming tomorrow!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is also our message, the message that we must &ldquo;noise abroad.&rdquo;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;When we do, we discover that sharing the peace we feel does not diminish what we have. Sharing increases our peace. It is, in fact, a channel of peace. When we share, the Lord magnifies what we have and we have more abundantly. We have peace like a river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we also come to know that when we don&rsquo;t share, we lose what we once had. When we experience peace but hoard it, keeping it to ourselves, it diminishes until we have it no more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to conclude with a story about a family who found the peace that is in Christ because good and faithful Latter-day Saints reached out and shared the gospel with them. As I recount this story, please note the connections with the channels of peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a story about David and Aimee Marie Hadley. They were high school sweethearts, married while attending the University of Idaho, and had three children. David had been baptized a member of the Church, but was not active. Aimee Marie had been raised Catholic, but she was not active in her faith either. Here is their story in Aimee Marie&rsquo;s words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"As our children grew, I began to strongly feel that something very important was missing from our lives. &nbsp;. . . After much thought and numerous prayers, I came to the conclusion that God was missing from our lives.&nbsp; . . . I began searching for answers to my prayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We became very good friends with Brett and Monica Nelson and their family in our hometown of Shelley, Idaho. They were very strong members of the LDS Church. I began to feel their strong family connection and great love for one another the more time we spent with them. I felt happy and peaceful in their home. I asked my friend about this, and she answered that it was the Savior and our Heavenly Father that filled their lives with the Spirit. She began to tell me about the Church and how it has brought so much love, peace, and joy to their family. She told me how important it is to her to know without a doubt that she will always be together with her family for all time and eternity in the celestial kingdom. I asked her to teach me more about it. During the following days I continued to pray for our family. One day soon after our discussions, two missionaries came to our home. Elder Waldman and Elder Rudd entered our home with a special glow and spirit about them.&nbsp; . . . I had a very strong feeling in my heart and soul that I wanted them to come and teach us about the Church and the scriptures on a regular basis. When they left on that first evening, I felt so happy and peaceful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The next Sunday, our family went to Church with . . . the Nelsons in their ward. I was full of the Spirit as I listened intently to the scriptures and members bearing their testimonies. I left feeling even stronger that this was something I wanted our family to be a part of. As weeks went by, we continued to attend Church every Sunday in our own ward and had weekly lessons taught to us by our wonderful missionaries.&nbsp; . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The missionaries have brought the Savior back into our lives after so many years of searching for answers. My children and I were baptized on April 30, 2011, only two short months after the missionaries came to our home for the first time. My husband is now active in the Church again after feeling the Spirit and watching our family receive so many blessings in our lives.&nbsp; . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I testify with all my heart that the gospel of Jesus Christ brings us true happiness in our lives. We all endure trials and challenges in life; however, having the power and gift of the Holy Ghost with us guides us and gives us the peace we need to get through those difficult times.&nbsp; . . . I am so blessed that our family has our Savior, Jesus Christ, and His living gospel in our lives."<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, there are many, many Hadley families out there. The Lord is working with them, preparing them to hear from us. I know that if we will speak to the people He puts in our paths, great miracles will occur. And so, in these times of turmoil and commotion, I say let us open our hearts and our mouths! Let us open the headwaters of obedience. Let us open the channels of peace in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we seek the Lord in mighty prayer, immerse ourselves in the scriptures, worship in holy places, and get up and go to work! Share the gospel. Invite friends and neighbors not of our faith to come to Church, to read the Book of Mormon, to come to our homes to meet with the missionaries. Walk across the street or down the block and extend the hand of love and fellowship to one who has wandered. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear witness that the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, will go with us. He will bless us and magnify us and lift us up. This is His Church and kingdom on the earth. He is preparing us and the kingdom for His return. If we act with faith in Him to share and invite, we will be the means of bringing souls to Him and peace will flow into their lives and into our lives like a river. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a blessing to be with you in this very special and dedicated place.&nbsp;We have gathered to worship together today, and I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us. We are in this beautiful place that separates us from the commotion in the world and helps us focus on the things of eternity. The world we live in is certainly in commotion. It is turbulent&mdash; filled with natural and man-made disasters; unexpected, dramatic political changes; wrenching shifts in economies; and much uncertainty. It is a world in which evil runs rampant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The commotion in the world is not far away. It is close to us, even in our own families at times.&nbsp;In this difficult, challenging world all of us yearn for peace. We yearn for solace, comfort, and reassurance. &nbsp;We seek a refuge from the storm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The peace we seek is in the &ldquo;merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The promise of peace the Savior makes to us is the same promise He made to His Apostles at the Last Supper: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. &nbsp;Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior&rsquo;s peace is much different and much more than the security, safety, and absence of war and contention the world offers as peace.&nbsp; As Elder M. Russell Ballard taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>" . . . the everlasting peace Jesus promises is an inner peace, born in faith, anchored by testimony, nurtured with love, and expressed through continual obedience and repentance.&nbsp; It is a peace of spirit that echoes through the heart and the soul. . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Peace&mdash;real peace, whole-souled to the very core of your being&mdash;comes only in and through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the peace the Savior offers us is an uplifting feeling of well-being that comes as a gift of the Spirit through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It is a deep assurance born of spiritual knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. It is a gift of eternal perspective that gives true understanding. It is a witness of the Spirit that our sins are remitted and that through the merits, mercy, and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we may qualify for and obtain eternal life. It is peace of conscience, peace of mind, peace of the whole heart and soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That peace only comes through obedience: acting in faith in Jesus Christ to repent of our sins and keep His commandments.&nbsp; In the words of Isaiah, &ldquo;there is no peace . . . [to] the wicked.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The Lord&rsquo;s promise is clear and unmistakable: &ldquo;he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we are true and faithful to our covenants, peace can come in abundance. As Isaiah said of the children of Israel: "O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, think of what the Lord has promised: the peace of Christ can be like a river that flows into our lives. Peace like a river.&nbsp;Peace flows into our lives from the headwaters of obedience. It flows in two channels. The first channel is our inner spiritual life. The second is doing the work of the Lord. These channels are not alternative ways to peace. They are both essential, and they are intimately connected. I want to consider these two channels with you today. Obedience makes the flow of peace possible, but there is much that we must do to open these channels and to keep them open that we might receive the great blessing of peace like a river.</p>
<p><strong><br /> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Channel #1:&nbsp; Our Inner Spiritual Life</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of us comes to earth with the capacity to think, reason, ponder, learn, understand, and comprehend. We are blessed with the capacity to feel love, joy, compassion, forgiveness, reverence, and beauty. We are given the Light of Christ to help us feel what is right and what is wrong. Our thoughts and feelings are spiritual in nature; they define our inner spiritual life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is in that inner spiritual life that the Lord speaks to us. He has commanded us to humble ourselves before Him so that our thoughts and feelings are open to His Spirit: "Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To walk in the meekness of His Spirit is to repent of our sins and act in humility to do His will guided by the Holy Spirit. Such a walk brings the companionship of the Holy Ghost and a flow of heavenly assurance, joy, healing, forgiveness, comfort, divine perspective, understanding, light, and truth. If our thoughts and feelings are open to and in tune with the Holy Ghost, we can receive peace like a river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But these are not the only feelings and thoughts vying for our attention. The natural man in us, the ideas and philosophies of men, the lures of the world, and the wiles of the devil all clamor for a place in our minds and hearts. It is easy to be distracted by the world, easy to be enticed by temptations, easy to be misled by false ideas. Even faithful Latter-day Saints may neglect their spiritual lives. There are so many projects to complete, so many errands to run, so many bills to pay, so many meetings to attend that it is easy to be absorbed in these concerns and neglect the life of the spirit.&nbsp; If we are not very careful and very diligent, this channel of peace may be disrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I suggest three things we can do to open our hearts and minds to the Holy Ghost and to keep that channel of peace open? They are: 1) pray morning and night; 2) study and ponder the scriptures every day; and 3) worship the Father and the Son in holy places&mdash;in our homes and through the sacred ordinances of the sacrament and the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all ought to ask ourselves if we have made these three things a priority in our lives.&nbsp;Do we set aside sufficient time morning and night to pray in faith with real intent, pouring out our souls to God in gratitude and thanksgiving, seeking His help for those in need, asking for His blessings in our families, in our work, and in our callings?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do we devote time to study and ponder the scriptures? Do we &ldquo;treasure up in [our] minds . . . the words of life&rdquo;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;so that we can hear the word of the Lord?&nbsp; Do we write down the impressions we receive and reflect on them?&nbsp;Do we express reverence and love for the Father and the Son in our families, in prayer, in testimony? Do we participate in the ordinance of the sacrament in a spirit of worship, expressing love and reverence for the Son of God, His love and mercy and grace? Do we always remember Him? Do we participate in sacred ordinances and worship in the house of the Lord regularly? Do we &ldquo;let the solemnities of eternity rest upon [our] minds?&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we consistently and diligently do all of these things with real intent, with real desire to communicate with our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, we experience over and over again our true relationship to Them. We go to the Father as His child, seeking His help, totally dependent on Him, thanking Him for His blessings, listening to His words, expressing to Him reverence and love. We go in the name of His Beloved Son relying wholly on His merits, conscious of our need for His mercy and grace, trusting in His redeeming love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are sacred moments. These are moments of revelation. Our Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers. The Savior reaches out to lift and strengthen us, to forgive us and cleanse us of sin. We experience the powers of godliness in the ordinances of salvation. Our faith increases. Our testimonies grow. We learn and understand and see. We feel comfort, assurance, and love. The channel opens, and God blesses us with peace like a river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is especially true in difficult times. There are times when our peace may be disrupted. In fact, there are times when it feels like life conspires to dump a big load of rocks right in the middle of our channel of peace. When that happens, and it will happen to us all, do not take counsel from your fears. Seek the blessings of heaven in prayer, in the scriptures, and in holy places. Act in faith in the Savior, and the channel will reopen; and peace like a river will flow once again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Channel #2:&nbsp; Doing the Work of the Lord</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>The Savior Himself spoke of the second channel, doing the work of the Lord, in these words to His disciples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The yoke of Christ certainly includes the covenants and commandments that are in the gospel of Jesus Christ. But it also includes His work&mdash;&ldquo;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;The work of salvation&mdash;including &ldquo;member missionary work, convert retention, activation of less-active members, temple and family history work, and teaching the gospel&rdquo;<sup>12</sup>&mdash;is the yoke of Christ. When we take upon ourselves that yoke, the Lord promises us &ldquo;rest unto [our] souls.&rdquo;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Doing the work of the Lord is a channel of peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I suggest three things we might do to open this channel of peace? They are: 1)&nbsp;accept and magnify callings in the Church; 2) share the gospel and invite others to act; and 3) act on spiritual impressions to help others.&nbsp;These are simple things prophets have taught from the beginning. We might ask ourselves if these things are ingrained in our lives.&nbsp;Do we accept callings and, as President Monson has taught, faithfully and diligently perform the service they require?&nbsp;Do we share the gospel with those not of our faith or those who may have wandered from the light? Do we reach out to rescue the lost soul?&nbsp;Do we act on the impressions we receive to go on the Lord&rsquo;s errand?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we do these things with the guidance of the Spirit, important things happen to us. Most importantly, the Savior goes with us in His service: "And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face.&nbsp; I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is in His service that we come to know Him. We see and feel how He works. He works through us to bless the lives of others. That is a stretching, humbling experience. It takes us outside of ourselves and helps us focus on the needs of others. Sometimes those needs seem overwhelming. We are called to act in His name, but we are acutely conscious of the fact that we cannot do what He asks alone. The only way forward is to act in faith in Him. And so we pray and get up off our knees and go to work, trusting that He will help us. And He does. He really is with us. His Spirit really is in our hearts, and the angels really are around us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we do simple acts of service like take a meal to someone we visit teach, or walk across the street to invite a less-active neighbor to Relief Society, or teach our Primary class, or give a copy of the Book of Mormon to the man sitting next to us on the airplane, or help a 15-year-old young man in the teacher&rsquo;s quorum who is struggling with pornography, or comfort the young couple we home teach who just lost a three-year-old daughter to cancer, or share testimony of tithing and the law of chastity with a young man investigating the Church, or a thousand other things the Lord wants done, He goes with us. He helps us see those in need as He sees them and feel about them the way He feels about them. We speak words we know come from Him. We discern needs and feel impressions about actions to take that we know are beyond our understanding. What we say and what we do have an impact on those we serve far beyond anything we have done. We feel a love for the people that we know is a spiritual gift; it is the pure love of Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In His service we become witnesses of His love, His mercy, His grace, and His power. Our testimony strengthens. The problems we have, our worries and concerns, are swallowed up in the service of the Lord. The Holy Ghost bears witness of Christ&rsquo;s love for us and His approval of our service. We gain new perspective. We see light and truth. We feel assurance. Our faith in Christ increases; our hope in Him grows; feelings of charity swell within us. The channel opens, and peace flows into our hearts and minds. Peace like a river.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I know that service to the Lord requires hard things. It takes courage to invite someone to hear the gospel. There are disappointments. People say no. Children don&rsquo;t listen. Some people turn away even after the Lord has blessed them and labored with them for a long time. It hurts. When you love someone, you open yourself to the possibility of pain and sorrow. And, of course, those rocks we talked about earlier&mdash;illness, accidents, the world economy, and so forth&mdash;may disrupt our peace. But the way forward, the way to restore peace is to serve the Lord. Serve in your calling. Share the gospel. Listen to the whisperings of the Spirit, and go to those in need. The channel will open and peace will flow&mdash;peace like a river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Abundance of the Lord</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>These two channels of peace&mdash;our inner spiritual life and doing the work of the Lord&mdash;are not separate and independent. Linked and fed by the headwaters of obedience, they are intimately connected. They complement and reinforce one another. When our inner spiritual life is strong, we qualify for the guidance and power of the Holy Spirit in our service to the Lord. Doing the Lord&rsquo;s work sends us to our knees in prayer and into the scriptures. We seek guidance and strength in holy places. Doing the work strengthens our inner spiritual life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fed by the headwaters, the channels of peace reinforce, magnify, and strengthen one another. When both are open and flowing, we experience the abundance of the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We feel a desire to share with others the peace we feel. We are like the people at the temple of Bountiful at the end of the first day of the Savior&rsquo;s visit to them. They went home, but they could not keep what they had experienced to themselves. Listen to what happened:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And it was noised abroad among the people immediately, before it was yet dark, that the multitude had seen Jesus, and that he had ministered unto them, and that he would also show himself on the morrow unto the multitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning Jesus; and insomuch did they send forth unto the people that there were many, yea, an exceedingly great number, did labor exceedingly all that night, that they might be on the morrow in the place where Jesus should show himself unto the multitude."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was the message that was noised abroad?&nbsp;He lives! The resurrected Lord has come. He lives! He taught us, healed us, and ministered unto us and brought peace to our souls! He is real! We saw Him! He is coming back! He is coming tomorrow!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is also our message, the message that we must &ldquo;noise abroad.&rdquo;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;When we do, we discover that sharing the peace we feel does not diminish what we have. Sharing increases our peace. It is, in fact, a channel of peace. When we share, the Lord magnifies what we have and we have more abundantly. We have peace like a river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we also come to know that when we don&rsquo;t share, we lose what we once had. When we experience peace but hoard it, keeping it to ourselves, it diminishes until we have it no more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to conclude with a story about a family who found the peace that is in Christ because good and faithful Latter-day Saints reached out and shared the gospel with them. As I recount this story, please note the connections with the channels of peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a story about David and Aimee Marie Hadley. They were high school sweethearts, married while attending the University of Idaho, and had three children. David had been baptized a member of the Church, but was not active. Aimee Marie had been raised Catholic, but she was not active in her faith either. Here is their story in Aimee Marie&rsquo;s words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"As our children grew, I began to strongly feel that something very important was missing from our lives. &nbsp;. . . After much thought and numerous prayers, I came to the conclusion that God was missing from our lives.&nbsp; . . . I began searching for answers to my prayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We became very good friends with Brett and Monica Nelson and their family in our hometown of Shelley, Idaho. They were very strong members of the LDS Church. I began to feel their strong family connection and great love for one another the more time we spent with them. I felt happy and peaceful in their home. I asked my friend about this, and she answered that it was the Savior and our Heavenly Father that filled their lives with the Spirit. She began to tell me about the Church and how it has brought so much love, peace, and joy to their family. She told me how important it is to her to know without a doubt that she will always be together with her family for all time and eternity in the celestial kingdom. I asked her to teach me more about it. During the following days I continued to pray for our family. One day soon after our discussions, two missionaries came to our home. Elder Waldman and Elder Rudd entered our home with a special glow and spirit about them.&nbsp; . . . I had a very strong feeling in my heart and soul that I wanted them to come and teach us about the Church and the scriptures on a regular basis. When they left on that first evening, I felt so happy and peaceful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The next Sunday, our family went to Church with . . . the Nelsons in their ward. I was full of the Spirit as I listened intently to the scriptures and members bearing their testimonies. I left feeling even stronger that this was something I wanted our family to be a part of. As weeks went by, we continued to attend Church every Sunday in our own ward and had weekly lessons taught to us by our wonderful missionaries.&nbsp; . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The missionaries have brought the Savior back into our lives after so many years of searching for answers. My children and I were baptized on April 30, 2011, only two short months after the missionaries came to our home for the first time. My husband is now active in the Church again after feeling the Spirit and watching our family receive so many blessings in our lives.&nbsp; . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I testify with all my heart that the gospel of Jesus Christ brings us true happiness in our lives. We all endure trials and challenges in life; however, having the power and gift of the Holy Ghost with us guides us and gives us the peace we need to get through those difficult times.&nbsp; . . . I am so blessed that our family has our Savior, Jesus Christ, and His living gospel in our lives."<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, there are many, many Hadley families out there. The Lord is working with them, preparing them to hear from us. I know that if we will speak to the people He puts in our paths, great miracles will occur. And so, in these times of turmoil and commotion, I say let us open our hearts and our mouths! Let us open the headwaters of obedience. Let us open the channels of peace in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we seek the Lord in mighty prayer, immerse ourselves in the scriptures, worship in holy places, and get up and go to work! Share the gospel. Invite friends and neighbors not of our faith to come to Church, to read the Book of Mormon, to come to our homes to meet with the missionaries. Walk across the street or down the block and extend the hand of love and fellowship to one who has wandered. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear witness that the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, will go with us. He will bless us and magnify us and lift us up. This is His Church and kingdom on the earth. He is preparing us and the kingdom for His return. If we act with faith in Him to share and invite, we will be the means of bringing souls to Him and peace will flow into their lives and into our lives like a river. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a privilege to be with you during this education week at BYU-Idaho. I have loved being on this campus since I was a student here, and am grateful to have received the assignment to speak at this devotional. It is especially nice to be in Rexburg during the two week stretch they label "summer" here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked through the program for this education week and noticed a number of great presenters and topics. I&rsquo;m sure your time in classes and activities is edifying for all of you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that President Clark spoke yesterday at the devotional and addressed the topic of peace. I will also make some remarks about peace, and though I will take a different approach to the topic you will see that my comments will serve as a second witness to some of the basic principles President Clark taught. President and Sister Clark are great examples of people who have found the keys to peace even in the midst of challenges and pressures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We live in a world where peace seems to be elusive. We all followed with horror the tragedy in Norway this past week, where one disturbed individual shattered the calm and peace of that wonderful nation&mdash;the nation where the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded. This is the country where I served my mission and it has been heart-wrenching to watch and read about the effect this had on those involved and on so many others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of things in this world that cause turmoil and conflict or that can undermine personal peace. War, armed conflict and terrorism are constantly taking their toll somewhere in the world, and crime, gang violence and other illegal activities affect the peace in our cities and towns. Earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and other natural disasters cause disruptions to peaceful lives, and the quakes in the economies of the world in recent years have left many struggling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some threats to our peace are more individual. Physical or emotional problems, pain, personal debt, addictions, fear, worry for others, and sins&mdash;either our own or someone else&rsquo;s that affect us&mdash;can seem to obstruct a peaceful outlook in our individual lives.&nbsp;There are two types of peace referred to in the scriptures and which we hope for in our lives as well. One is the absence of war, turmoil and strife between nations, groups or individuals. The other is the inner peace of the soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The theme of education week is &ldquo;Where Can I Turn for Peace?&rdquo; The ultimate answer to this question is, "To the Prince of Peace." He holds the answers for both types of peace. If we were to look at each item from the list of threats to peace that I mentioned we can see that the complete and final solution for each of those concerns can be found in the Savior Jesus Christ. He can control the elements. He has power to heal individuals and nations. His Atonement makes possible the forgiveness of sins and frees people from afflictions and addictions.His teachings contain the keys to living in peace individually and as a world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I would like to focus my remarks on the inner peace of the soul. By doing this I don&rsquo;t mean to imply that the other type of peace is unimportant or impossible for us to affect. Though we can&rsquo;t completely control war, tumult and strife, we should do all we can to &ldquo;proclaim peace&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and work to alleviate conflict and suffering in the world around us.&nbsp; We can be involved in community and civic affairs.&nbsp; We can be law abiding citizens and good neighbors.&nbsp; We can and should have a significant influence because of our &ldquo;peaceable walk with the children of men.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inner peace is part of the fruit of the Spirit. &ldquo;The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith.&rdquo;<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>The Savior said, &ldquo;My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.&rdquo;<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>Peace is a gift. We don&rsquo;t determine the conditions upon which this gift is given. He sets the terms. Sometimes our quest for peace becomes so focused on the peace itself that we forget it is a gift that is one of the fruits of a righteous life. Our best course for finding peace is to live righteously&mdash;to keep our covenants. This is the only course that leads to that inner peace we all desire. One of the lines in the hymn chosen for the theme of this education week is, &ldquo;Where is my solace when other sources cease to make me whole?&rdquo;<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>The adversary would tempt us to put all our efforts in directions other than a righteous life in our search for peace, but if we do this we will be disappointed in the end, for that true peace only comes from the Lord as a result of our righteous lives. There are also many worthy pursuits that are good and helpful, but if they take precedence over a worthy life they never lead to that true peace we seek.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the gift of peace there isn&rsquo;t a promise that all our problems and challenges will dissolve according to a timeline we set. We can actually have peace in the midst of trials. President Howard W. Hunter said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indifference to the Savior or failure to keep the commandments of God brings about insecurity, inner turmoil, and contention.&nbsp; These are the opposite of peace.&nbsp; Peace can come to an individual only by an unconditional surrender&mdash;surrender to him who is the Prince of Peace, who has power to confer peace.&nbsp; One may live in beautiful and peaceful surroundings but, because of inner dissension and discord, be in a state of constant turmoil.&nbsp; On the other hand, one may be in the midst of utter destruction and the bloodshed of war and yet have the serenity of unspeakable peace.&nbsp; If we look to man and the ways of the world, we will find turmoil and confusion.&nbsp; If we will but turn to God, we will find peace for the restless soul.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail. It was hardly a setting naturally conducive to peaceful feelings, particularly in light of the struggles of the saints who had been driven from Missouri. Joseph&rsquo;s own circumstances and those of his people weighed on his soul and he cried out in anguish to the Lord. The Lord answered by saying, &ldquo;My son, peace be unto thy soul,&rdquo;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;and Joseph was given the gift of peace even though his circumstances didn&rsquo;t change right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott related a personal experience of a struggle for peace regarding a situation over which he did not have complete control. He said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I once had an experience that caused me immense anxiety. I was severely troubled. It had nothing to do with disobedience or transgression but with a vitally important human relationship. I was so overcome with concern that I did something I never do. I left my office early and went home to pray. For some time I poured my heart out to the Lord. Try as I might, I could find no solution, no settling of the powerful stirring within me. I pled for help from that Eternal Father I have come to know and trust completely. I could see no path that would provide the calm that is my blessing to generally enjoy. Sleep overcame me. When I awoke I was totally at peace. I knelt again in solemn prayer and asked, &ldquo;Lord, how is it done?&rdquo; In my heart, I knew the answer was His love and His concern for me. That is consummate peace.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that Elder Scott was troubled by something not brought upon him by his disobedience, but the Lord was able to bestow peace even if the situation wasn&rsquo;t totally resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes peace comes in the most trying circumstances. We have each experienced this when we have been in very difficult times trying to do the right things and have been blessed with a powerful feeling of peace and love. There are many examples of this in the scriptures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Alma had tried his best to teach the people of Ammonihah they reviled him, spit on him and cast him out of the city. While Alma was journeying away from the city he was &ldquo;&hellip;weighed down with sorrow &hellip; and anguish of soul, because of the wickedness of the people &hellip; of Ammonihah, it came to pass while Alma was thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him saying: Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore lift up thy head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the commandments of God.&rdquo;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Imagine how this must have made Alma feel after such a trying time. Also, notice the reason the angel said that Alma had great reason to rejoice&mdash;that he had been faithful in keeping the commandments. It wasn&rsquo;t based on the reaction of the people of Ammonihah to the truth. It was based on Alma&rsquo;s righteousness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story of Nephi in the book of Helaman follows a similar pattern. Nephi had just miraculously proclaimed the truth of the murder of the chief judge by the judge&rsquo;s brother, but the people as a whole were not converted and Nephi was</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;much cast down because of the wickedness of the &hellip; Nephites &hellip; and it came to pass as he was thus pondering in his heart, behold, a voice came unto him saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou has with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but has sought my will, and to keep my commandments. &hellip; because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever.&rdquo;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you imagine how Nephi must have felt to hear these words? What peace would this bring to a person? Again, he received these assurances based on his devotion and righteousness, not on the reaction to his teachings by the people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is comforting to know that we are eligible for this peace if we are faithful and diligent even if others we love choose to wander from the truth--including members of our own families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mormon and Moroni provide examples of individuals remaining steadfast and working diligently in the most trying of circumstances.&nbsp; They lived in a time when the civilization around them was on a steep downward path.&nbsp; Mormon lamented that his people were without civilization and delighted in abomination.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;He wrote to Moroni, &ldquo;O the depravity of my people!&nbsp; They are without order and without mercy&hellip; And they have become strong in their perversion; and they are &hellip; brutal, &hellip; and they delight in everything save that which is good &hellip; they are without principle, and past feeling.&rdquo;<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But even with the society in such decline Mormon told his son, Moroni, &ldquo;Notwithstanding their hardness, let us labor diligently; for if we should cease to labor, we should be brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.&rdquo;<sup>13&nbsp;</sup>He reminded his son where their hope and peace was found:&nbsp; &ldquo;...be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down &hellip; but may Christ lift thee up &hellip; and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever.&nbsp; And may the grace of God the Father &hellip; and our Lord Jesus Christ &hellip; be, and abide with you forever.&rdquo;<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This pattern of our inner peace being dependent on our own diligence and righteousness is pervasive.&nbsp; A beautiful verse in Psalms includes the phrase, &ldquo;&hellip;righteousness and peace have kissed each other.&rdquo;<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who choose unrighteousness cannot experience this inner peace. Isaiah speaks of those whose iniquities have separated them from God. He says &ldquo;Their feet run to evil, &hellip; and &hellip; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity &hellip; The way of peace they know not &hellip; they have made them crooked paths:&nbsp; whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.&rdquo;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Isaiah summarizes this truth in very few words, &ldquo;There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.&rdquo;<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when we are trying to live a righteous life, if we give in to temptations we can damage the inner peace we want and need. The prophet Nephi lamented that he struggled with this in his life.&nbsp; He wrote, &ldquo;&hellip;why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul?&rdquo;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;This is something each of us faces. Nephi mentioned that one thing he struggled with was being angry with his enemies. Each of us is aware of specific temptations we struggle with that open the door for the adversary to have place in our heart. The more we can resist these temptations, the less influence the adversary has to destroy our peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview I once had with a person coming back into the Church I was struck by how clearly this person had come to understand this principle. He recounted how letting go of the iron rod and walking in forbidden paths had brought much sorrow and strife in his life and his efforts to return to a righteous life had opened the way for the gift of peace to be bestowed on him again. He was so grateful to have that in his life again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Nephites also found their way back after having been led astray by Sherem, an anti-Christ, with his false teachings and flattering words. Sherem was struck down by the power of God and the people ended up turning away from his teachings and returning to righteous ways. Jacob recounts that &ldquo;peace and the love of God was restored again among the people; and they searched the scriptures, and hearkened no more to the words of this wicked man.&rdquo;<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A story from the New Testament highlights the power of the Savior. He was crossing the Sea of Galilee with his disciples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful?How is it that ye have no faith? And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?&rdquo;<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may be times in our own lives when we are in stormy seas with high winds and our ship may seem to be taking on water. We may be tempted to ask, &ldquo;Carest thou not that &lsquo;I&rsquo; perish?&rdquo; We know He has the power to calm any storm. Sometimes He calms the actual storms we are facing, but other times instead of calming the wind and sea we face, He instead gives us great calm in our souls. One of the phrases from "Where can I turn for peace?" is "He answers privately."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Many times our experience with His great gift of peace is very personal and private and individual. A young mother faced with serious challenges found this out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During October 2003, Aaron and Lorraine Thatcher&rsquo;s two little daughters, 17-month-old Kaitlin and 6-month-old Madelyn, were diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Shortly before the unexpected diagnosis, Aaron had to be hospitalized with kidney stones. Lorraine, meanwhile, was expecting their third child and was battling morning sickness. It was a heavy, dark time for the little family. Lorraine commented, &ldquo;It was as if all our hopes and dreams for our children had been stolen away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of Aaron&rsquo;s and Lorraine&rsquo;s poor health, Aaron&rsquo;s mother spent nights in the hospital with the little girls. Lorraine would make her way to the hospital whenever her intense nausea abated. It all seemed impossible to handle. The little girls needed the comfort of their mother, and she was unable to be there at all times. The sorrow and guilt she felt only added to the heavy burden of coping with the new changes in her family&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around noon one day she dragged herself to her car, sick, exhausted, and full of anxiety. As she headed toward the hospital, she turned on some soothing music and listened to the words of her favorite hymn&mdash;a hymn that had comforted her in the past when her mother had died. As the music surrounded her, it was as if the Lord were speaking the penetrating words directly to her mind and heart:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed, </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>For I am thy God and will still give thee aid. </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand, &hellip; </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand. </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>When through the deep waters I call thee to go, </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The rivers of sorrow shall not thee o&rsquo;erflow, </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless, &hellip; </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress. </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie, </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply. </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design &hellip; </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine. &hellip; </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I will not, I cannot, desert to his foes; </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake, &hellip; </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ll never, no never, no never forsake! </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>(&ldquo;How Firm a Foundation,&rdquo;<em> Hymns, </em>no. 85)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A short time later, Aaron and Lorraine brought their daughters home. Relief Society sisters had cleaned the house, done the wash, and filled the kitchen with food. Aaron and Lorraine felt the peacefulness of the clean home as they entered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A package had been left on their doorstep. Opening it, they found a beautifully framed picture of the Savior. Typed and mounted with the picture were the words to the hymn that had been such a direct, personal message of peace to Lorraine. A sister in the ward, thinking the message was appropriate for this little family, had thoughtfully made the gift. She had no idea that these words had special meaning to Lorraine. Lorraine felt the Spirit gently confirm that the Lord loved her, was aware of her, and would help lift her burdens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lorraine was living her life righteously and the Lord blessed her with peace in the midst of trying times. This pattern repeats itself and is found in the scriptures over and over again. A story in the Book of Mormon shows this pattern and also illustrates the connection between faith and hope and feeling peace in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one point in the long wars between the Nephites and Lamanites, Helaman was recounting to Moroni the precarious circumstances he and his stripling warriors found themselves in. Because of lack of reinforcements and lack of supplies it looked as if they would be overthrown. He wrote, &ldquo;We did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies &hellip; and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him.&rdquo;<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice the connection between faith, hope and peace. One reason this inner peace can be so powerful is because of our absolute faith and hope in the power of the Atonement and the power of the Savior. He told His disciples, &ldquo;These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.&rdquo;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter how daunting the challenges are in our lives or in the world around us, we know we can have peace through the power of the infinite Atonement, because Christ overcame the world. Faith in Jesus Christ and in His Atonement engenders the hope of deliverance and the promise of a better world to come. Using this &ldquo;eye of faith&rdquo;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;to see the fulfilling of the promises deepens the peace within us since we know of the great blessings and relief that await us if we will only remain faithful in this life.&nbsp;Even in troubled times we have a great promise of peace from the Lord. &ldquo;&hellip;he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come.&rdquo;<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that our Heavenly Father and His son, Jesus Christ love us, and that the great gift of peace in this life is available to each of us. I pray that as each person here strives to follow the Savior, peace will be poured into every heart. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I am happy to be gathered with you today. When I arrived at BYU-Idaho ten years ago this month, I determined then that I would never take for granted the opportunity to teach and learn all knowledge through a gospel lens. I pray that the Spirit will attend this meeting; that according to our preparation he will teach us and testify of truth.<br /><br />I have always loved school and always loved learning. When I was younger I had a misconception regarding learning. I assumed that a time would come in our lives when we would reach a pinnacle of learning; when we would know all that we need to know and spend the rest of our lives applying that knowledge. When I graduated from high school and headed for BYU, I felt that I already knew all that I needed to know to be successful in college. I learned many lessons during the four years I spent in Provo. When I graduated from BYU as a young wife expecting her first child I was by that time smart enough to recognize that I was not quite as knowledgeable as I had assumed. And now two graduate degrees, six children, and 17 grandchildren later I have come to the full realization of how little I know and how much I still need to learn.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the few minutes we have together today I'd like to share with you a few of what I refer to as life lessons. Some I've learned along the way and others are lessons a few of my last semester students share; lessons they have learned as well as lessons they wish they had known when first coming to BYU-Idaho. Recognize that these lessons do not involve any financial commitment or monetary sacrifice--they can't be purchased! But they can be developed and bless not only our lives but the lives of those around us. As you listen and ponder the thoughts shared today, I would challenge you to identify at least one life lesson that you can learn from and then be willing to do so!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Life Lesson #1: Learn to be Kind</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Think for a moment of someone whom you consider to be kind. What is it about that individual that leads you to define him or her as kind? Possibly you would describe them as thoughtful, non-judgmental, compassionate, friendly, charitable, caring, or Christ-like. How well do those words describe you? Would those who know you consider you to be kind? How do we recognize kindness in others?&nbsp;<br /><br />As a young wife I always thought my husband was kind, but quickly learned just how genuinely kind he is. Shortly after we graduated from BYU we moved into a basement apartment in Bountiful, Utah, as our first non-student home. We had a new little baby and I was so homesick. One weekend, after having saved enough money to make the trip, we were preparing to head to Las Vegas to visit my family. When my husband got home from work on Friday, we packed our one and only car and were just about ready to head out when I questioned if I had locked the apartment windows. While my husband went back to check, I decided to help us get moving a little faster by backing out of our carport and pulling into the front of the apartment. Unfortunately, I didn't think to close the driver's door when I began backing out and the next thing I knew the door was hanging off the hinges, having been wrenched loose by a concrete pilaster in the center of the carport.&nbsp;<br /><br />I sat there stunned! I must admit I was not only embarrassed but a little worried about what my husband's reaction would be when he saw the door hanging there! I heard his footsteps coming out of the apartment and down to the carport; I prepared for the worst. As he came around the corner and saw the situation that I had created, he calmly and kindly stated, "You'd better go and call your parents; let them know we're going to be a little late getting there." That was it! Not another word was said about the door hanging off its hinges. I knew I had married a genuinely good and kind man!&nbsp;<br /><br />What does kindness look like at BYU-Idaho? There is a human factor associated with kindness that involves people to people connections. Kindness can and does exist independent of cell phones and iPods. Kindness is evidenced through a smile, a friendly greeting, an act of service to those we do or do not know. Let me share some thoughts from my students:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I've learned that it's important to put yourself out there and make friends with people in your classes. It makes a big difference to success in classes and just your overall happiness."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Smile at everyone. You never know how much it affects someone."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Something I'm so glad that I've learned since coming to BYU-Idaho is the Spirit of Ricks. I love how this spirit is felt through classes and those you come in contact with. People here are so friendly I really should have had no reason to be nervous coming here."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Kindness will be unmistakable through our charitable actions of loving our neighbors and refraining from judging others. Listen again to the lessons learned by BYU-Idaho students:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"People have their own unique situations and we all have struggles in [our] lives. They may look like they [don't] have any troubles but they always do. Be willing to get to know people and help them as much as you can."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Everyone is different and has some sort of struggles. Respect everyone and don't judge anyone."</p>
<p>In April 2005 General Conference, Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin taught: "Kindness is the essence of a celestial life. Kindness is how a Christ-like person treats others. Kindness should permeate all of our words and actions at work, at school, at church, and especially in our homes . . ."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />"But," you ask, "what if people are rude?" Love them. "If they are obnoxious?" Love them. "But what if they offend? Surely I must do something then?" Love them. "Wayward?" The answer is the same. Be kind. Love them. Why? In the scriptures Jude taught, "And of some have compassion, making a difference." Who can tell what far-reaching impact we can have if we are only kind?&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's be a little kinder!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Life Lesson #2:&nbsp; Learn to be Responsible</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />For many, this may be your first time away from home or your first experience living with roommates. It may be the first time you have actually had to manage your time or your money, cook a meal, or do your own laundry. Suddenly all responsibility falls on you. There's no longer mom or dad around to wake you up in the morning; no one to remind you to do your homework (or take it with you to class); no one to make sure that from that bottomless pit of dirty laundry emerges freshly washed and folded clothes. It all depends on you!&nbsp;<br /><br />We are reminded in Galatians 6:7 that "...whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."&nbsp; I am happy to tell you there is hope for those who are not yet the responsible individual you aspire to become. I'm prepared to admit that when I first went to college I was not the responsible person who stands before you today. I had never balanced a checkbook and thought as long as I had checks I could keep writing them. It only made sense that if I had checks I would still have money left. Not so!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Coming from Las Vegas, I assumed if it snowed that classes would be cancelled that day. I couldn't imagine anyone going out in a storm. If it was a snowy morning, I'd roll over in bed and go back to sleep. Let me assure you there is no "Snow Day" policy at BYU-Idaho. I also assumed if you didn't like or need a class, you just stopped attending it. That's how a professor would know that you'd dropped it. When I received my first semester grades and saw that I had failed a class I was honestly shocked! How could my professor fail me? He certainly had to realize that since I had obviously stopped attending class I had obviously dropped it. Obviously not! But I learned, changed my ways, and did eventually graduate with a decent GPA.&nbsp;<br /><br />So let me clarify. You are the one responsible for every aspect of your performance at BYU-Idaho: academic, spiritual, and social. Learn from other students as they share their BYU-Idaho life lessons regarding responsibility:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wish I would have met with a counselor at the beginning of my first semester and better planned out my semesters."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wish I would have known more about the major options. I wish I could have seen just a big list of all the majors offered at BYU-Idaho."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wish I had known how to manage my time well, so that I would be able to not only get good grades, but also to enable me to get enough sleep."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wish I would have known how much attendance helps grades. Because teachers would allow 2-3 [absences] before it hurt your grade, I gave myself the same.&nbsp; This semester I have gone to every class possible and my grades are better than they have ever been."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I have learned to prioritize and manage my time well. I have found out that the more balance (school, social, spiritual) I have in my life, the happier I am and the better I function."</p>
<p>As you learn to be responsible you will avoid the tendency to blame others for the results of your actions. Avoid blaming your lack of preparation for class on a friend who begged you to "come out and do something fun." Avoid blaming your poor test performance on a professor who "doesn't know how to teach to a learner like you." Avoid blaming your late arrival at sacrament meeting on your roommate who "forgot to set an alarm." By not assuming responsibility for our own actions we run the risk of developing a spirit of entitlement. Reflect on these words from President Kim B. Clark delivered at our September 2010 Devotional:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If you and I have the spirit of entitlement, it means we have an attitude and belief that the world&nbsp;<em>owes</em>&nbsp;us what we want. Like Laman and Lemuel, some who harbor the spirit of entitlement believe they have been shortchanged in life or aggrieved in some way and that they deserve more than they are getting. Often those who succumb to the spirit of entitlement feel superior to those around them, or believe certain rules should not apply to them, or that they should not be required to do what everyone else has to do. They believe they are entitled to special treatment and special privileges. They want something for nothing."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Take just a moment and conduct a brief "self-check" by asking yourself the following questions. Do I tend to make excuses for my actions and choices? Do I tend to blame others when things don't go the way I'd like? Do I accept the consequences of my actions and choices knowing that they are a result of my agency? Do I choose to act rather than be acted upon?&nbsp;<br /><br />Embrace the responsibility to be actively involved in every aspect of the BYU-Idaho experience, including your ward and stake. Attend your meetings on time; gladly accept and diligently fulfill callings; attend and participate in Family Home Evenings; love and support your bishopric; make it a goal to get to know all of your ward members. My students have learned the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I've learned that college life includes not only academics but also social and spiritual. I had been so focused on school I left no time for anything else."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Have faith. The Lord will take care of you and help you survive if you are faithful. Hard times will come, there is no doubt about that, but with the Lord's help we somehow come out alive and successful."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wish I knew the importance of getting involved. It took me a few semesters to understand why this is important, but the experiences I've had with involvement so far have honestly changed my life. I've learned that Heavenly Father truly needs me here to do His work, and I can do all things when I rely on Him.&nbsp; Miracles happen every day that help His work progress."</p>
<p>Assume responsibility!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Life Lesson #3:&nbsp; Learn to be Thankful</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Two of the most powerful words in the English language are "thank you." These words have the power to change an attitude, lift a burden, brighten a dark day, or soften a heart. In Doctrine and Covenants 59 we are counseled to "...thank the Lord thy God in all things."&nbsp; President Monson taught in the October 2010 General Conference that "Sincerely giving thanks not only helps us recognize our blessings, but it also unlocks the doors of heaven and helps us feel God's love." We have so many blessings to be thankful for, though we'll address just two.&nbsp;<br /><br />First, be thankful for your family. The family unit is essential to Heavenly Father's plan for our mortal experience. Think for a moment about your family. Doesn't your heart just melt a little when you do? I have learned that through my family I have experienced both life's greatest joys and life's greatest heartaches. None of us come from a perfect family, nor will we create a perfect family. What we can do is strive to be a perfect member of our family. I am absolutely crazy about my family. I adore them and count them as one of the greatest blessings in my life. I am not a perfect daughter, sister, wife, mother, grandmother, or mother-in-law--but I am trying to become a little better each day. Avoid being critical of family members who are less than perfect. Appreciate the efforts of all within the scope of your family. Have you had the "a-ha" moment of one of my students who wished she had known before leaving home how much she relied on her parents?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Express your thanks to your parents, your siblings, your grandparents--all those in your life who have been instrumental in loving you, nurturing you and providing for both your temporal and spiritual needs. Express your thanks often and sincerely. My mother passed away rather unexpectedly many years ago. While in the hospital for a routine procedure, due to human error with medication administration she suffered a stroke to the brain stem and never regained consciousness. There was no time to express final thoughts with someone whom I loved so dearly. She was gone before we had that opportunity. But because I had expressed my love and appreciation to my mother on a nearly daily basis, I was not burdened with the thought of "if only"--"if only" I had told my mother how thankful I was for her; "if only" I had told her how much I looked to her as an example of a righteous Latter-day Saint woman; "if only" I had expressed my love and appreciation. I had told her, often and sincerely, and I knew that she knew.&nbsp;<br /><br />Secondly, be thankful to be at this university. I love BYU-Idaho, and I pray that if you don't yet share that sentiment that the time will quickly come when you do. Some day you will come to realize what a blessing it is to have the opportunity to learn secular knowledge through a gospel lens. Listen again to the voices of students:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I didn't think I'd take to the gospel being integrated into the curriculum as well as I did. Looking back now, I can't even imagine why...I love being able to bring aspects of the gospel into the class! It is almost like finally bringing together two important parts of my life that have been separate."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Something that I have learned coming to BYU-Idaho from California is the great impact the Spirit has on the school. Attending a school where the Church and gospel are discussed openly in class and where the spirit is welcomed in before each class has helped me grow greatly in aspects of the gospel as well as my other studies."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"One thing I learned at BYU-Idaho is gratitude! Here at BYU-Idaho we have all been taught that our tuition is so much cheaper than most schools because of tithe payers. This makes me want to gain an education even more because it wouldn't be my money going to waste if I don't get the most out of school; it will be the Lord's money, and that is something I don't want to put to waste."</p>
<p>Be thankful for all that you have.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Life Lesson #4: Learn to be Steadfast&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />What does it mean to be steadfast? According to Dictionary.com, steadfast is an adjective meaning fixed in direction; firm in purpose; unwavering. In relating steadfastness to the gospel, we can see it refers to our being steadily directed on the gospel path, firm in our faith, and unwavering in our commitment to living gospel principles. Steadfastness also relates to our role as students. I propose that if we are steadfast we are committed to seeing our studies through "to the end," course by course. We are firm in our purpose for gaining an education, recognizing that the Lord has commanded us to "...seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (Doctrine and Covenants 88:118).&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope I haven't led you to believe this path will be without challenges or heartaches; that it will be easy and require little effort on our part. That is not the case. I can assure you that each of Heavenly Father's children will experience trials and challenges in our efforts to be steadfast; but in the same way I can assure you that we are not left alone in meeting those trials and challenges. My students shared the following:&nbsp;<br /><br />"It is all worth it in the end. If you feel like giving up, don't! Keep trying. "&nbsp;<br /><br />"Always make time for scriptures, prayer, and going to the temple. Miracles will happen even if they're little miracles. Heavenly Father will help you with everything else in your life when you put Him first. Remember that He loves you!"&nbsp;<br /><br />"I have learned that the Lord's way is the best way. He has a plan for me, and if my plan does not match His plan as long as I am living worthy He will direct me to His plan and I am far happier when I am doing His plan."&nbsp;<br /><br />What can we learn from the example of others that will help us remain steadfast?&nbsp;<br /><br />From the prophet Abraham's response to the commandment to sacrifice his son Isaac, we can learn of unwavering, steadfast obedience. Likely none us will ever be required to demonstrate obedience in that same manner, yet each of us will be required to demonstrate our unwavering obedience in remaining steadfast. Elder Richard G. Scott has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"You cannot today remotely imagine what that decision to be unwaveringly obedient to the Lord will allow you to accomplish in life. Your quiet, uncompromising determination to live a righteous life will couple you to inspiration and power beyond your capacity now to understand."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Three times in the scriptural account of Abraham and Isaac we read the phrase "here am I" or "here I am." When the Lord calls to us, are we worthy and willing to respond, "Here am I"? From the Prophet Joseph Smith we can learn steadfastness in the face of adversity.&nbsp; In spite of experiencing hatred and persecution for saying that he had seen a vision, he never waivered from the truth. As recorded in his history, the Prophet stated, "...For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation" (Joseph Smith-History 1:25). Ask yourself the following: am I steadfast in my loyalty and devotion to the Lord? Or am I more worried about offending man than I am about offending God?&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most important life lessons I have learned is to be steadfast in waiting for the Lord. As the psalmist wrote, "I waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry" (Psalms 40:1). The summer of my high school graduation I received a very personal witness of Heavenly Father's awareness of and love for each of His children. When I arrived in Provo for my freshman year, I sought out my patriarchal blessing, desirous of better knowing the will of my Father for me his daughter. I received very specific counsel and direction but was left with lingering questions and uncertainty. Should I change my major? Should I change the course I had prayerfully determined prior to coming to school? Through fasting and prayer the Spirit taught me to be patient, to continue forward, and to know that Heavenly Father was aware of me and my needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I finished my degree and graduated as I had originally planned. I was privileged to be a stay-at-home mother of six children. I served faithfully in my Church callings and responsibilities and engaged in voluntary community service. And during this time I waited steadfastly and patiently for further direction from the Lord. And it came. Not in my time, but in His. Opportunities seemed to appear from nowhere. Ways and means were provided for me to pursue my graduate work. Time after time I was in the right place at the right time. I was led and prepared to acquire the knowledge and experience necessary for me to fulfill the Lord's purposes. I have felt the guidance and tender mercies of the Lord throughout my life. It is His hand that led me to where I am today. I testify to you that if we remain steadfast and faithful, trusting in the Lord, He will direct our paths.&nbsp;<br /><br />Be steadfast. Be faithful.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was struck by the words of Elder Neil L. Andersen during the April 2009 General Conference when he said, "I know that I am not what I must become." Brothers and sisters, I know that I am not what I must become. I know that you are not what you must become. But I also know without a doubt that as we travel the path of mortality, if we will learn from life's lessons and sincerely strive to be kind, to be responsible, to be thankful and to be steadfast, we can become all that our Heavenly Father would have us become. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am happy to be gathered with you today.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Kindness will be unmistakable through our charitable actions of loving our neighbors and refraining from judging others. Listen again to the lessons learned by BYU-Idaho students:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"People have their own unique situations and we all have struggles in [our] lives. They may look like they [don't] have any troubles but they always do. Be willing to get to know people and help them as much as you can."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Everyone is different and has some sort of struggles. Respect everyone and don't judge anyone."</p>
<p>In April 2005 General Conference, Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin taught: "Kindness is the essence of a celestial life. Kindness is how a Christ-like person treats others. Kindness should permeate all of our words and actions at work, at school, at church, and especially in our homes . . ."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />"But," you ask, "what if people are rude?" Love them. "If they are obnoxious?" Love them. "But what if they offend? Surely I must do something then?" Love them. "Wayward?" The answer is the same. Be kind. Love them. Why? In the scriptures Jude taught, "And of some have compassion, making a difference." Who can tell what far-reaching impact we can have if we are only kind?&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's be a little kinder!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Life Lesson #2:&nbsp; Learn to be Responsible</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />For many, this may be your first time away from home or your first experience living with roommates. It may be the first time you have actually had to manage your time or your money, cook a meal, or do your own laundry. Suddenly all responsibility falls on you. There's no longer mom or dad around to wake you up in the morning; no one to remind you to do your homework (or take it with you to class); no one to make sure that from that bottomless pit of dirty laundry emerges freshly washed and folded clothes. It all depends on you!&nbsp;<br /><br />We are reminded in Galatians 6:7 that "...whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."&nbsp; I am happy to tell you there is hope for those who are not yet the responsible individual you aspire to become. I'm prepared to admit that when I first went to college I was not the responsible person who stands before you today. I had never balanced a checkbook and thought as long as I had checks I could keep writing them. It only made sense that if I had checks I would still have money left. Not so!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Coming from Las Vegas, I assumed if it snowed that classes would be cancelled that day. I couldn't imagine anyone going out in a storm. If it was a snowy morning, I'd roll over in bed and go back to sleep. Let me assure you there is no "Snow Day" policy at BYU-Idaho. I also assumed if you didn't like or need a class, you just stopped attending it. That's how a professor would know that you'd dropped it. When I received my first semester grades and saw that I had failed a class I was honestly shocked! How could my professor fail me? He certainly had to realize that since I had obviously stopped attending class I had obviously dropped it. Obviously not! But I learned, changed my ways, and did eventually graduate with a decent GPA.&nbsp;<br /><br />So let me clarify. You are the one responsible for every aspect of your performance at BYU-Idaho: academic, spiritual, and social. Learn from other students as they share their BYU-Idaho life lessons regarding responsibility:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wish I would have met with a counselor at the beginning of my first semester and better planned out my semesters."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wish I would have known more about the major options. I wish I could have seen just a big list of all the majors offered at BYU-Idaho."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wish I had known how to manage my time well, so that I would be able to not only get good grades, but also to enable me to get enough sleep."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wish I would have known how much attendance helps grades. Because teachers would allow 2-3 [absences] before it hurt your grade, I gave myself the same.&nbsp; This semester I have gone to every class possible and my grades are better than they have ever been."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I have learned to prioritize and manage my time well. I have found out that the more balance (school, social, spiritual) I have in my life, the happier I am and the better I function."</p>
<p>As you learn to be responsible you will avoid the tendency to blame others for the results of your actions. Avoid blaming your lack of preparation for class on a friend who begged you to "come out and do something fun." Avoid blaming your poor test performance on a professor who "doesn't know how to teach to a learner like you." Avoid blaming your late arrival at sacrament meeting on your roommate who "forgot to set an alarm." By not assuming responsibility for our own actions we run the risk of developing a spirit of entitlement. Reflect on these words from President Kim B. Clark delivered at our September 2010 Devotional:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If you and I have the spirit of entitlement, it means we have an attitude and belief that the world&nbsp;<em>owes</em>&nbsp;us what we want. Like Laman and Lemuel, some who harbor the spirit of entitlement believe they have been shortchanged in life or aggrieved in some way and that they deserve more than they are getting. Often those who succumb to the spirit of entitlement feel superior to those around them, or believe certain rules should not apply to them, or that they should not be required to do what everyone else has to do. They believe they are entitled to special treatment and special privileges. They want something for nothing."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Take just a moment and conduct a brief "self-check" by asking yourself the following questions. Do I tend to make excuses for my actions and choices? Do I tend to blame others when things don't go the way I'd like? Do I accept the consequences of my actions and choices knowing that they are a result of my agency? Do I choose to act rather than be acted upon?&nbsp;<br /><br />Embrace the responsibility to be actively involved in every aspect of the BYU-Idaho experience, including your ward and stake. Attend your meetings on time; gladly accept and diligently fulfill callings; attend and participate in Family Home Evenings; love and support your bishopric; make it a goal to get to know all of your ward members. My students have learned the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I've learned that college life includes not only academics but also social and spiritual. I had been so focused on school I left no time for anything else."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Have faith. The Lord will take care of you and help you survive if you are faithful. Hard times will come, there is no doubt about that, but with the Lord's help we somehow come out alive and successful."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wish I knew the importance of getting involved. It took me a few semesters to understand why this is important, but the experiences I've had with involvement so far have honestly changed my life. I've learned that Heavenly Father truly needs me here to do His work, and I can do all things when I rely on Him.&nbsp; Miracles happen every day that help His work progress."</p>
<p>Assume responsibility!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Life Lesson #3:&nbsp; Learn to be Thankful</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Two of the most powerful words in the English language are "thank you." These words have the power to change an attitude, lift a burden, brighten a dark day, or soften a heart. In Doctrine and Covenants 59 we are counseled to "...thank the Lord thy God in all things."&nbsp; President Monson taught in the October 2010 General Conference that "Sincerely giving thanks not only helps us recognize our blessings, but it also unlocks the doors of heaven and helps us feel God's love." We have so many blessings to be thankful for, though we'll address just two.&nbsp;<br /><br />First, be thankful for your family. The family unit is essential to Heavenly Father's plan for our mortal experience. Think for a moment about your family. Doesn't your heart just melt a little when you do? I have learned that through my family I have experienced both life's greatest joys and life's greatest heartaches. None of us come from a perfect family, nor will we create a perfect family. What we can do is strive to be a perfect member of our family. I am absolutely crazy about my family. I adore them and count them as one of the greatest blessings in my life. I am not a perfect daughter, sister, wife, mother, grandmother, or mother-in-law--but I am trying to become a little better each day. Avoid being critical of family members who are less than perfect. Appreciate the efforts of all within the scope of your family. Have you had the "a-ha" moment of one of my students who wished she had known before leaving home how much she relied on her parents?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Express your thanks to your parents, your siblings, your grandparents--all those in your life who have been instrumental in loving you, nurturing you and providing for both your temporal and spiritual needs. Express your thanks often and sincerely. My mother passed away rather unexpectedly many years ago. While in the hospital for a routine procedure, due to human error with medication administration she suffered a stroke to the brain stem and never regained consciousness. There was no time to express final thoughts with someone whom I loved so dearly. She was gone before we had that opportunity. But because I had expressed my love and appreciation to my mother on a nearly daily basis, I was not burdened with the thought of "if only"--"if only" I had told my mother how thankful I was for her; "if only" I had told her how much I looked to her as an example of a righteous Latter-day Saint woman; "if only" I had expressed my love and appreciation. I had told her, often and sincerely, and I knew that she knew.&nbsp;<br /><br />Secondly, be thankful to be at this university. I love BYU-Idaho, and I pray that if you don't yet share that sentiment that the time will quickly come when you do. Some day you will come to realize what a blessing it is to have the opportunity to learn secular knowledge through a gospel lens. Listen again to the voices of students:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I didn't think I'd take to the gospel being integrated into the curriculum as well as I did. Looking back now, I can't even imagine why...I love being able to bring aspects of the gospel into the class! It is almost like finally bringing together two important parts of my life that have been separate."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Something that I have learned coming to BYU-Idaho from California is the great impact the Spirit has on the school. Attending a school where the Church and gospel are discussed openly in class and where the spirit is welcomed in before each class has helped me grow greatly in aspects of the gospel as well as my other studies."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"One thing I learned at BYU-Idaho is gratitude! Here at BYU-Idaho we have all been taught that our tuition is so much cheaper than most schools because of tithe payers. This makes me want to gain an education even more because it wouldn't be my money going to waste if I don't get the most out of school; it will be the Lord's money, and that is something I don't want to put to waste."</p>
<p>Be thankful for all that you have.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Life Lesson #4: Learn to be Steadfast&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />What does it mean to be steadfast? According to Dictionary.com, steadfast is an adjective meaning fixed in direction; firm in purpose; unwavering. In relating steadfastness to the gospel, we can see it refers to our being steadily directed on the gospel path, firm in our faith, and unwavering in our commitment to living gospel principles. Steadfastness also relates to our role as students. I propose that if we are steadfast we are committed to seeing our studies through "to the end," course by course. We are firm in our purpose for gaining an education, recognizing that the Lord has commanded us to "...seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (Doctrine and Covenants 88:118).&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope I haven't led you to believe this path will be without challenges or heartaches; that it will be easy and require little effort on our part. That is not the case. I can assure you that each of Heavenly Father's children will experience trials and challenges in our efforts to be steadfast; but in the same way I can assure you that we are not left alone in meeting those trials and challenges. My students shared the following:&nbsp;<br /><br />"It is all worth it in the end. If you feel like giving up, don't! Keep trying. "&nbsp;<br /><br />"Always make time for scriptures, prayer, and going to the temple. Miracles will happen even if they're little miracles. Heavenly Father will help you with everything else in your life when you put Him first. Remember that He loves you!"&nbsp;<br /><br />"I have learned that the Lord's way is the best way. He has a plan for me, and if my plan does not match His plan as long as I am living worthy He will direct me to His plan and I am far happier when I am doing His plan."&nbsp;<br /><br />What can we learn from the example of others that will help us remain steadfast?&nbsp;<br /><br />From the prophet Abraham's response to the commandment to sacrifice his son Isaac, we can learn of unwavering, steadfast obedience. Likely none us will ever be required to demonstrate obedience in that same manner, yet each of us will be required to demonstrate our unwavering obedience in remaining steadfast. Elder Richard G. Scott has taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"You cannot today remotely imagine what that decision to be unwaveringly obedient to the Lord will allow you to accomplish in life. Your quiet, uncompromising determination to live a righteous life will couple you to inspiration and power beyond your capacity now to understand."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Three times in the scriptural account of Abraham and Isaac we read the phrase "here am I" or "here I am." When the Lord calls to us, are we worthy and willing to respond, "Here am I"? From the Prophet Joseph Smith we can learn steadfastness in the face of adversity.&nbsp; In spite of experiencing hatred and persecution for saying that he had seen a vision, he never waivered from the truth. As recorded in his history, the Prophet stated, "...For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation" (Joseph Smith-History 1:25). Ask yourself the following: am I steadfast in my loyalty and devotion to the Lord? Or am I more worried about offending man than I am about offending God?&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most important life lessons I have learned is to be steadfast in waiting for the Lord. As the psalmist wrote, "I waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry" (Psalms 40:1). The summer of my high school graduation I received a very personal witness of Heavenly Father's awareness of and love for each of His children. When I arrived in Provo for my freshman year, I sought out my patriarchal blessing, desirous of better knowing the will of my Father for me his daughter. I received very specific counsel and direction but was left with lingering questions and uncertainty. Should I change my major? Should I change the course I had prayerfully determined prior to coming to school? Through fasting and prayer the Spirit taught me to be patient, to continue forward, and to know that Heavenly Father was aware of me and my needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I finished my degree and graduated as I had originally planned. I was privileged to be a stay-at-home mother of six children. I served faithfully in my Church callings and responsibilities and engaged in voluntary community service. And during this time I waited steadfastly and patiently for further direction from the Lord. And it came. Not in my time, but in His. Opportunities seemed to appear from nowhere. Ways and means were provided for me to pursue my graduate work. Time after time I was in the right place at the right time. I was led and prepared to acquire the knowledge and experience necessary for me to fulfill the Lord's purposes. I have felt the guidance and tender mercies of the Lord throughout my life. It is His hand that led me to where I am today. I testify to you that if we remain steadfast and faithful, trusting in the Lord, He will direct our paths.&nbsp;<br /><br />Be steadfast. Be faithful.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was struck by the words of Elder Neil L. Andersen during the April 2009 General Conference when he said, "I know that I am not what I must become." Brothers and sisters, I know that I am not what I must become. I know that you are not what you must become. But I also know without a doubt that as we travel the path of mortality, if we will learn from life's lessons and sincerely strive to be kind, to be responsible, to be thankful and to be steadfast, we can become all that our Heavenly Father would have us become. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Health, Recreation, &amp; Human Performance Faculty Member</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Back in November 1999, I was asked by our college dean to give a presentation to our college's faculty about how to prepare for Y2K. "Y2K" stood for the year 2000--particularly January 1, 2000--when apparently all computers and basically anything electronic was supposed to crash; when life as we knew it would come to a screeching halt. Personally I did not worry too much about it. I knew that I would be with a group of students up in the Teton Mountains for a weeklong backcountry ski and winter camping trip called Winter Summit. Nothing happened to us. We had no computers and no electricity, just a lot of great new powder snow. I don't believe anything happened anywhere.&nbsp;<br /><br />But, still there were many who were worried, which is why I was asked to give the talk. Having taught outdoor survival skills, winter camping, and other outdoor courses, I guess our dean thought I could give some suggestions on how to deal with the impending doom. Without asking him, I decided to take a different approach to the topic. Instead of discussing how to prepare for Y2K, I gave my presentation on "YK2?" Here the "Y" did not represent a year, nor did "2K." Rather the "Y" stood for a question: Why? And the K2 stood for just that--K2--the world's second highest mountain and one of the most difficult and challenging to climb. K2, known as the "savage mountain," has the second highest fatality rate among the world's 14 highest mountains: those above 8,000 meters, or 26,247 feet. For every four climbers who reach the summit of K2, one has died trying.&nbsp;<br /><br />With the odds of 1-in-5 will die, why would anyone want to try such a thing? Why would anyone want to take such tremendous risk? Why would anyone want to go through so much hardship and effort to merely stand on the summit of a mountain for literally just a few minutes? But, my question to the faculty was, "why not?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me share with you an exercise I did with the faculty and one I have done with a number of my classes here on campus which might provide some insight as to why some people choose to do such physically, mentally, emotionally, and sometime spiritually difficult tasks. I realize there are holes in my argument large enough to drive trucks through, but there is a message I pray you will all understand.&nbsp;<br /><br />Imagine a chalkboard with two columns on it: column A and column B. I write a word in column A and then ask the participants to come up with several words that are the opposite of the word. The first word in column A is "comfortable," but you cannot use the word "uncomfortable." We are all in college; we have imaginations and hopefully are somewhat intelligent; we can do more than change the prefix.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here are the words the faculty and many students have come up with as the opposite of "comfortable": "uneasy," "racked," "scathing," "awkward," "spiny," "painful," "stiff," and "terrifying." The next word was "permanent." The words faculty and students decided upon were: "terminal," "temporary," "short-lived," "fleeting," and "changing." The third word was "safe." The opposites: "vulnerable," "treacherous," "dangerous," "hazardous," "daunting," "fun," "harmful," "perilous," and "fatal."&nbsp;<br /><br />"Routine" was the next word under column A. The column B words were: "spontaneous," "random," "disorganized," "chaotic," "colorful," "off-course," "erratic," "extraordinary," "progressive," and "surprising." We combined the next two: "familiar/sure thing." The opposites people stated were: "doubt," "foreign," "alien," "unusual," "curious," "peculiar," "new," "distant," "risky," "bizarre," "sketchy," and "chance."&nbsp;<br /><br />"Sterile" was next. Naturally many responded by yelling out: "dirty" and "contaminated." Others who thought a bit deeper said, "fertile," "rabid," "productive," "fruitful," "lush," and "static." The responses? "Clear," "concise," "animated," "elastic," "dynamic," "vibrant," and "volatile." The second to last word was "control." The responses here were very interesting: "chaos," "anarchy," "revolution," "panic," "liberation," "rebellion," "freedom," "choice," and "free agency."&nbsp;<br /><br />The question was then asked: if each of these lists, A and B, represent lifestyles, which one would most of us like to live? With only one exception everyone said "A." When asked for a reason for wanting to live an "A" lifestyle, the most frequent response was that it is comfortable, safe, familiar, and so on using most of the "A" words from the list.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was asked once to give a presentation in our ward's Relief Society on raising children. We went through this exercise and I asked them which column represents the way they try to raise their children. As you might guess, the answer was a resounding A. They stated each word and gave reason for their response. "Of course we want our homes and families to be 'comfortable'--why on earth would we want an uneasy, racked, or scathing home or family?" "'Permanent'? We want our furniture in the same place when our children come home as it was when they left for school. We don't want to confuse them!" "'Safe'? That is just plain right and good. Who wouldn't want their children safe?" "'Sterile'? Are you kidding? We clean our homes daily!" "'Static'--Hey we have cable; we don't get static. "'Control'--You bet we want control. How else are you to raise children?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, they almost convinced me they were right. If you can't tell, I was there and I am here to shed some favorable light on column B. When these ladies asked me, "Isn't that what you want for your children?" I got ready to duck in case purses or scripture cases came flying at me. I really struggled. But then a miracle happened in my life. One of the sisters, one I would have never guessed would asked the following question, after very tentatively raising her hand asked, &nbsp;"What kind of life did Jesus live? Was he comfortable? Was he ever in a permanent place? Isn't there a scripture about the birds having nests to rest in, but the Son of Man hath no place to rest his head. Was he safe?" He certainly wasn't sterile. His life did not appear to be overly routine. Really, the only descriptor we could argue with was that of control. He was in control, but those who were against Him certainly had a different idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So why is it we tend to choose the "A" style of life and not the "B"? Why do we try to make our lives so different from Christ's life? Think about that, will you? What is your reason? Let me share a couple of statements by mountaineers that explain why they have chosen a type "B" style of life. First, Dr. Charles S. Houston, a great medical doctor who performed studies dealing with the effect of severely cold temperatures and high altitude on the human body. In 1953, he and a group of other American climbers set out to climb K2. They did not reach the summit, but they did attain greatness by surviving one of the worst storms in mountaineering history, high above what has come to be known as the Death Zone--that area above 25,000 feet where your body basically feeds on itself and you are dying faster than you are living. Here is Dr. Houston's thought:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In the year that has passed since our ordeal we have been asked the question "Why climb mountains?" many times and have answered it in many ways. No answer is complete or satisfactory. Perhaps there is no single answer; perhaps each climber must have his own reasons for such an effort. The answer cannot be simple; it is compounded of such elements as the great beauty of clear cold air, of colors beyond the ordinary, of the lure of unknown regions beyond the rim of experience. The pleasure of physical fitness, the pride of conquering a steep and difficult rock pitch, the thrill of danger -but danger controlled by skill-are also there.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"How can I phrase what seems to me the most important reason of all? &nbsp;It is the chance to be briefly free of the small concerns off our common lives, [that "A" stuff] to strip off nonessentials, to come down to the core of life itself. Food, shelter, friends--these are the essentials, theses plus faith and purpose and a deep and unrelenting determination. On great mountains all purpose is concentrated on the single job at hand, yet the summit is but a token of success, and the attempt is worthy in itself. It is for these reasons that we climb, and in climbing find something greater than accomplishment."</p>
<p>Sounds a little like serving a mission, doesn't it? The other statement comes from a modern day mountaineer, Mark Jenkins. He answered the question "Why do men climb mountains?" to justify his recent ascent of Mt. Everest. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"On a mountain, caught inside a welter of ambition, fear and struggle, [a welter is a situation where you are being effected by different influences at the same time, like ambition, fear, and struggle] you will shove yourself right out on the edge--climb right to the lip and get a good long look into the abyss. In that look, all you see, all you know, all you can possibly feel is the absolute intensity of your own mortality. The sheer, inalienable certainty that, 'Hey, I am alive.' This is exactly where the rest of life keeps you from going. This is exactly the confrontation modern man strives to elude. At all cost avoid it. Avoid being there. [At the edge.] Stand back. Keep cool. Keep everything, including your own life, at arms length. Keep this perspective: 'I like to watch.' That's the right answer. Everyone a spectator. The perfect passionless life. And that's it! That's what puts men on mountains. The fear more sick than the fear of death; more dreaded the fear of failure, the fear of mediocrity. The excruciating fear of a life without passion."</p>
<p>I hope that thought gets to some of you. Author and ocean sailor Webb Chiles stated: "Live passionately, even if it kills you--because something is going to kill you anyway."&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, back to the word lists. Which list would you put the word "boredom" under? How many of you would put it under A? How about B? Well, you are right there with everyone else who has every responded to that question. So it goes without saying--the lifestyle most of us have chosen is boring. I think that is unfortunate. So what is the opposite of boredom? The best answer I know of comes from the classic Disney film, "Never Cry Wolf."&nbsp;<br /><br />In this film a young biologist by the last name of Tyler was sent to the far northern reaches of Canada to determine if wolves were responsible for killing off the great caribou herds. To get to his desired destination, the Valley of the Black Stone, Tyler had to travel by plane. The only plane available was an old prop plane known as a De Havilland Beaver. In the film the plane was literally held together with duct tape and wire. The pilot, Rosie Little, was a real entrepreneur, always looking for a way to make extra money. During the flight as the plane was inching its way past tall, rugged mountains Rosie asks Tyler what it was in the Valley of the Black Stone he is looking for. "Is it gold?" he asked. "Silver?" Tyler's response was, "It is hard to say." Rosie's response was, "Well, we are prospectors up here, all scratching for gold, so we won't have to scratch anymore. But I will tell you, Tyler, the gold isn't in the ground. The real gold is south, in the States, sitting in front of the TV, bored to death, bored to death Tyler."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Right then the plane's engine begins to cough and sputter. Pretty soon you see the propeller begin to slow down and eventually stop completely. Very excitedly, Tyler asks Rosie, "What's going on?" Rosie's answer: "Boredom, Tyler, that's what's going on." You can imagine Tyler was anything but bored. Rosie asked the next question. "How do you deal with boredom, Tyler?" He then reached into a toolbox and pulled out a big crescent wrench, waved it in Tyler's face, and simply said--this is the key word--"Adventure. Adventure, Tyler." He then opened the door of the plane, stepped out onto the wing strut and began to hit the frozen fuel line with the wrench. Since this scene took place in the first 10 minutes of the film, they obviously survived.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But, the big word here is "adventure." What is the definition of adventure? It certainly is different to different people. For some, adventure is going away to college. For others, the big adventure may be a mission, marriage, a career. Asking someone for a date, speaking at devotional, climbing the Grand Teton, running the Hoback section of the Snake River, riding a bike for 100 miles in one day. Let me share with you a great definition of adventure. This is from an individual named Bill Quinn. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Adventure speaks of beginning, boldness, power, active involvement, of a quest, of human desire, of drive to experience that which is hidden and unknown. It was the concept of adventure that stimulated early man to discover and inhabit the world. The essence of adventure is a tremendously powerful inner desire for 'a something, a condition' which is absent. It is a process that begins with the acceptance of a situation where you know you will need to call upon all your own talents, abilities, skills, strengths, and courage just to get through--not necessarily succeed, but just survive."</p>
<p>Think of the adventure the Jaredites had for 344 days. Crossing the ocean in those barges. Do you remember what was in those barges? People, plants, animals, and birds--flocks and herds of them--they were like eight little arks. These Jaredites were list B people. Ether 6:4 states:&nbsp; ...They got aboard of their vessels or barges, and set forth into the sea commending themselves unto the Lord their God." Could you do that? How deep does your faith go? How far are you willing to go based on your faith? How great of challenge are you willing to accept based on your faith? Are you willing to set forth into the unknown commending yourself to the Lord your God?&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you accept the adventures that life hands or sometimes throws at you unconditionally or conditionally? Do you ever stop after a supposed success? Eugene O'Neil said, "Those who succeed and do not push on to greater chances of failure are the spiritual middle classers. Their stopping at success is the proof of their compromising insignificance. Only through the unattainable does man achieve a hope worth living and dying for."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you ask or seek for options that will allow you to stop, reconsider, and possibly go back home? In the stake I belong to there have been about 10 missionaries who have come home early the past year and a half. This is a similar statistic for all the Rexburg stakes. (I wonder how that statistic correlates to the fact that our Church represents 15 percent of all the Boy Scouts of America and also represents 50 percent of all accidents and deaths in the Boy Scouts of America.) Often times the reason for coming home early is, "It's too hard."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A friend of mine, Vance Hendrix, used to be a counselor here on campus. He served as a mission president and then as a specially called counselor with his wife to deal with missionaries who left their missions to come home. The Hendrixs told me that often those who came home were what they referred to as "Triple A Missionaries." They were athletic, attractive, and affluent. Things had been easy for these young men; they had been taken care of. I would like to add another "A" to make them "Four A Missionaries": attached. Either to mom, a girl or boyfriend, home, even electronics from what I hear now. Simply put, they have not been put into positions where they have had to experience column B type of adventures. Rather they often lived secure, safe, comfortable, and yes, static, sterile lives. Helen Keller was noted as saying on this subject: "Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing at all."&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Holland made the following comments:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I am convinced that missionary work is not easy because salvation is not a cheap experience. Salvation never was easy. We are The Church of Jesus Christ, this is the truth, and He is our great eternal head. How could we believe it would be easy for us when it was never easy for him? ...When you are confronted with challenges that are difficult to conquer or you have questions arise, the answers to which you do not know, hold fast to the things you do know. Hang on to your firmest foundation, however limited that may be, and from that position of strength face the unknown...On this upward and sometimes hazardous journey, each of us meets our share of daily challenges. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If we are not careful, as we peer through the narrow lens of self-interest, we may feel that life is bringing us more than our fair share of trials--that somehow others seem to be getting off more lightly. But the tests of life are tailored for our own best interests, and all will face the burdens best suited to their own mortal experience. In the end we will realize that God is merciful as well as just and that all the rules are fair. We can be reassured that our challenges will be the ones we needed, and conquering them will bring blessings we could have received in no other way...He (Christ) has, He reminds us, "graven thee upon the palms of my hands" (1 Nephi 21:16).&nbsp; Considering the incomprehensible cost of the Crucifixion, Christ is not going to turn his back on us now."</p>
<p>&nbsp;During April 1970 General Conference, Elder Harold B. Lee was sustained as the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The prophet was Joseph Fielding Smith. President Lee was in his early 70s and President Smith was in his early 90s. I personally believe President Lee had an idea of what the future had in store for him. In his talk, he said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"More than ever before, I understand what the ancient prophet Nephi felt when he had been given the seemingly insurmountable task by his father, Lehi, to gain possession of the brass plates in which were contained the scriptures of the prophets of the Old Testament, as we now know them. Nephi had written of this experience: '...I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban. And I was led by the Spirit; not knowing beforehand the things which I should do."</p>
<p>I will add here that Nephi continued to write, "Nevertheless I went forth..." President Lee goes on: "I understand now more than ever before the poignant prayer of the suppliant: 'Lead, kindly light, amid the circling gloom; lead thou me on! The night is dark, and I am far from home;&nbsp; lead thou me on! Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see the distant scene , one step enough for me.'" &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Lee concluded by stating, "That, I too now sense very deeply, I must go on many occasions, as Nephi of old, being 'led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.' Yes, though the night be dark, 'I do not ask to see the distant scene - one step [is] enough for me.'"&nbsp;<br /><br />I pray that we may all be willing to be led by the Spirit, not always knowing beforehand the things you should do, but be prepared to do them. Please remember the counsel given in 2 Nephi 25:23: "For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do." It is my hope that we will do all we can do, no matter what comes our way or what challenges we are called to face so that we will all be recipients of God's grace. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>I'm grateful for the opportunity to be with you and pray that the Spirit will teach and we will listen. We are blessed to live in an interesting time in history. The fullness of the gospel is spreading across the earth. Temples dot the land. And the power of the priesthood is building the kingdom of God. But it is also a challenging time. Family breakdown is common. The sanctity of marriage is threatened. And wickedness abounds. Surely we live in the best and worst of times--and to what purpose?<br /><br />&nbsp;Joseph Smith said, "Happiness is the object and design of our existence."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I'm sure each of us at times questions our level of happiness. We might believe that we'll be happier when some condition has changed. At age 11, you might have considered happiness to be age 12 when you at last could leave Primary and move on to the Young Men and Young Women programs. But it was only temporary happiness, because you discovered you had to be 14 to attend dances, and 16 to drive and date.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Later, you might have believed that happiness began when you graduated from high school or completed a mission. As students you may believe you'll be happier when the semester is over, when you're dating, when you're married, or when your schooling is done and you have a real job. For some, happiness seems always just around the corner. A few changing conditions, and then we'll be happy.&nbsp;<br /><br />We can learn much about happiness from the Book of Mormon. &nbsp;In Alma 50:23, we read: "But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni..." May I remind you that Moroni was a military leader. The Lamanites have attacked the edges of the land and will soon march on Zarahemla. The Kingmen are seeking to overthrow the government. And Moroni's men are without needed supplies. And yet there was never a happier time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, happiness is not dependent on the absence of hardships, stress, or troubles. Neither is it dependent on conditions of peace and prosperity. In fact, facing our challenges with faith and determination may encourage happiness. Nephi taught that there needs be opposition in all things for righteousness and ultimately happiness to be brought to pass.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I'd like to share an example from my own family experience. While it doesn't rival the challenges of pioneers, it had many lessons for us. Years ago my employment took us to Little Rock, Arkansas. We decided to buy a home in the rural suburbs of Little Rock. We had visions of a peaceful country setting with a few acres that would allow us to enjoy the tranquility and beauty of country life.&nbsp;<br /><br />We quickly found out that we are city folk. We weren't quite sure what to do with our three acres, except mow it. We didn't have any animals-except the unwanted ones that regularly ate our garden. We moved to our little piece of paradise early in the spring with only a 21-inch push lawn mower to serve as both our lawn mower and brush hog. Southern folks will know what I'm talking about. With all the expenses of a new home, we weren't in a position to purchase a large riding lawn mower. Instead, we divided our three acres into five segments and assigned each child who was old enough a segment to mow each week. When one was finished with their segment, the lawn mower would be passed to the next person. Over the course of a week, our lawn generally got mowed. Occasionally, our neighbor would feel sorry for us and make a few swipes with his large tractor-mower.&nbsp;<br /><br />After a couple of seasons of this, our family was ready for a riding lawn mower. We investigated our options carefully and finally decided on a zero-radius, liquid-cooled 36-horsepower mower with a 60-inch cut that could mow an acre in 12 minutes. The lawn mower was called the "Bad Boy." Our family was excited. Our preschooler asked to take promotional literature to share with his preschool friends. Mowing suddenly became a recreational activity instead of a chore. One night soon after getting our lawnmower, our preschooler came into our bedroom and asked if he could talk with us. He'd obviously had been deep in thought so we gave him our full attention. He said, "Mom, Dad, when you die can I have the lawn mower?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />While this may be a silly story, it illustrates for me how our hardships can help us appreciate the blessings in our life. Had we not experienced the challenge of mowing with a small push mower, I'm quite sure, the new riding lawn mower and satisfaction of a nice yard would have been less exciting and gone largely unappreciated.&nbsp;<br /><br />Likewise, life's challenges help us to better appreciate our blessings and recognize the joy in daily living. Perhaps the sweet moments of happiness that we experience come not despite hardships and challenges, but because we have risen above them. Clearly, we can and should be happy even during difficult times. President Hinckley reminded us "Life is to be enjoyed, not just endured."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In 2 Nephi 5:27, we're told Nephi and his people "lived after the manner of happiness." As I've studied the manner of happiness among Nephi and his people, I've recognized six things I believe are important to cultivating happiness in our lives.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Keep the Commandments</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />First, we must keep the commandments. We learn in 2 Nephi 5:10 that Nephi and his people "did observe to keep the judgments and the statutes and the commandments of the Lord in all things." Obedience is key to living after the manner of happiness. When we align our lives with eternal laws and truth, the windows of heaven will be opened wide and we'll prosper in the land. There is no lasting happiness without obedience. Alma taught, "Wickedness never was happiness."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course we may not prosper after the manner of the world. Obedience is not a guarantee for financial gain. And financial gain is not a predictor of happiness. One scholar found there is no relationship between happiness and income except among those in extreme poverty. So if you're not starving, more money will not make you happier. But obedience to the commandments is a guarantee that we'll prosper in the Lord's way-after the manner of happiness. My observations and personal experiences have confirmed that we are richly blessed when we keep the commandments. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Serve One Another</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Second, we must serve one another. Service gives us purpose. A life of service is living after the manner of happiness. Nephi consecrated priests to serve the people. He desired that he not be their king, but willingly became their servant and teacher. True happiness requires selfless service. The world often encourages a focus on self-interest to the point of selfishness. It fosters extreme individualism and an unhealthy form of self-esteem. As children of God, we have a noble heritage and boundless potential, but our confidence should never border on conceit or pride. Like Ammon of old, our confidence must be based in the Lord.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;With God, all things are possible.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Service can help us build confidence with humility.&nbsp;<br /><br />The value of service is also evident from the talents and gifts the Lord gives us. In the 46th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, it reads: "For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God. To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby."&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of us has been blessed with different talents and gifts. I have wondered at times why we all aren't given all of the gifts. Why not make everyone a math wiz, an artist, or mechanically minded? I have come to believe that having different talents and gifts makes us dependent on one another. It sets up the scenario of service. It allows us to share our skills with others "that all may be profited thereby profit."&nbsp;<br /><br />President Joseph F. Smith said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"There can be no genuine happiness separate and apart from the home, and every effort made to sanctify and preserve its influence is uplifting to those who toil and sacrifice for its establishment. Men and women often seek to substitute some other life for that of the home; they would make themselves believe that the home means restraint; that the highest liberty is the fullest opportunity to move about at will. There is no happiness without service, and there is no service greater than that which converts the home into a divine institution, and which promotes and preserves family life."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;There can be no happiness without service. Service gives our lives purpose. It gives us a cause. Having a cause gives our lives meaning and enables happiness. Our founding fathers fought and died in the cause of freedom that all might have the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;What is your cause or purpose? What keeps you engaged in the service of your fellowmen? Participating fully and actively in our families and communities can create many opportunities. It can broaden our network of relationships, provide opportunities for service, and provide a meaningful cause or purpose to which we can contribute our skills. Happiness is being a part of something good.&nbsp;<br /><br />Years ago as I prepared to depart for full-time missionary service, my stake president told me if I ever came across anyone I disliked, I should find a way to serve them. Then I would learn to love them. I have found this advice to be true. Love and service are virtues that are closely linked. Both are prerequisites to happiness. So if you want to be happy, do something for others. It shows we care for others and helps them care for us. Service connects people and forges relationships. Happiness is helping another.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Cultivate Relationships</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Third, we live after the manner of happiness when we cultivate relationships with our family and friends. We believe families are forever. We are born into mortality as social beings. What could be more central to the plan of happiness than family? From 2 Nephi 5:6 we learn it wasn't enough for Nephi to save himself from the wrath of his brothers.&nbsp; He wanted to also save his family. It reads: "Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my family, and also Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother and his family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my sisters, and all those who would go with me."&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, we are social beings who are happiest when in the company of loved ones. In the first moments of life, infants seek out familiar voices. They are intrigued by the human face and comforted by human touch. And in a matter of weeks they solicit human interaction through a social smile. We are born to be social. For infants and children, attachments to caregivers provide safety, security, and modeling that ensures healthy development.&nbsp;<br /><br />But even as adults, we need the support that comes from the "the fellowship of kindred spirits," and "the bearing of one another's burdens." Meaningful relationships help fulfill our need to belong to something bigger than ourselves. The network of friends and family also provides us with opportunities to help or be helped. When there's an emergency, happy people know whom to call to help them through the crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />While healthy relationships are a predictor of happiness, we cannot permit troubled relationships to hold our happiness hostage. Nephi's happiness was not dependent on everyone liking him. He fled because his brothers wanted to kill him. In our own lives, there will always be those who point the finger of scorn from the great and spacious building.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Like Nephi, at times it may be best for us to separate ourselves from those who threaten physical or spiritual safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />While we should always be ready to receive the returning prodigal and mend troubled relationships, we cannot comprise our values or leave the straight and narrow path to do so. But, we also should not harbor grudges or be easily offended. Harboring ill feelings will destroy our happiness. We must be quick to forgive.&nbsp;<br /><br />Too often we ruminate over incidences in the past. Mentally wallowing again and again through the muck of our lives is not good for our happiness. We must forgive, forget, and move on. Happiness is repentance and forgiveness.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Work Hard</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Fourth, living after the manner of happiness requires hard work. Unlike his brothers, who became an idle people, Nephi and his people made work a regular part of their lives. From 2 Nephi 5: 17, we read: "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be industrious, and to labor with their hands."&nbsp;<br /><br />The Nephites sowed seeds and reaped in abundance. They raised flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Nephi taught his people to build buildings and to work all manner of woods and precious ores. The Nephites worked.&nbsp;<br /><br />At times, we might think we'd be happier with less work and more leisure in our life. While there is satisfaction in a job well done&nbsp;and a place for rest and recreation, work is not something to be shunned-but rather something to be enjoyed. I find it interesting that in Ecclesiastes 5:19 it tells us that every man should "rejoice in his labor: this is a gift from God."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;I must admit, I have not always considered work a gift from God. But to my surprise, I now find great satisfaction in tilling the earth, laboring with my hands, and toiling by sweat of my face.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;I am happiest when I am working.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are richly blessed when we keep God's commandment to work. In fact, working is one of the fundamental Ten Commandments. In Exodus 20:8-9, we're commanded: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work..." Often we think of these verses as focusing only on keeping the Sabbath day holy. But that is only half of the commandment. God's commandment to Moses was also "six days shalt thou labor."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />But what if we're wealthy or retired and don't need to work to maintain our living? Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, "Work is always a spiritual necessity even if for some, work is not an economical necessity."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Work has always and will always be connected to happiness. Certainly we can be overworked. When a challenge becomes a burden laden with anxiety and discouragement, the resulting stress can be overwhelming and unhealthy. The old adage of moderation in all things is certainly true for work. Still we must be anxiously engaged. We must act in faith. We must use our skills and talents to boldly confront the challenges of life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Happiness does not always require success in our labors, or attainment of the goal--rather there is satisfaction in a consecrated purpose, a focused cause, and a deliberate effort. So if you want to live after the manner of happiness-work on something challenging. Till the earth. Work up a sweat. Enjoy the fruits of your labor. Happiness is knowing you've made a contribution.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Be Prepared</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Fifth, living after the manner of happiness requires preparation. In 2 Nephi 5:14, we learn Nephi and his people "did take the sword of Laban, and after the manner of it did make many swords, lest by any means the people who were now called Lamanites should come upon us." Being caught short or found lacking when a challenge hits frustrates our peace of mind and destroys our happiness. Whether the preparation is for an exam, a triathlon, a talk, or an unexpected car repair, it is easier for us to maintain our happiness when we are prepared.&nbsp;<br /><br />The story is told of a farmer who needed an extra hand to help on his farm. Several interviewed for the position and the farmer asked each about his qualifications for the job. The response of one young man left the farmer both confused and intrigued. He had simply said, "I can sleep when the wind blows." The young man was hired and worked diligently through the harvest.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Autumn ended and the first cold storm of winter came late one night. The farmer panicked as the winds began to blow. Calling the young man for help, the farmer grabbed his coat and boots. He was disappointed to find the young man asleep at a time like this. Grudgingly he ventured out alone to move the animals to the barn and then fix a hole in the roof. He mumbled as he thought of the farm equipment left to rust in the field.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, when the farmer reached the barn all the animals were tucked safely inside. In fact, clean hay had already been set out for the new day. Not a single hole could be found in the roof, and the tractor was parked perfectly in the shed. "Who could have done it?" the farmer wondered. And then, he realized what the young man's answer meant. "I can sleep when the wind blows."&nbsp;<br /><br />Our Church leaders have long encouraged us to prepare both physically, educationally, and spiritually for the challenges of life. Preparation is a key part of the BYU-Idaho Learning Model. You'll find your schooling and life a happier experience if you are prepared. Living after the manner of happiness requires preparation.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Choose Happiness</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Sixth, living after the manner of happiness requires that we are grateful and choose to be happy. Life wasn't easy for Nephi and his people, but they chose happiness. Yes, there were times of despair. Even Nephi, whose optimism is legendary had times of heartache and discouragement. Times when his "heart wept" and his "soul lingered in the valley of sorrow" and his "strength slackened."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Even Nephi at times needed to remind himself to choose to be happy. In 2 Nephi 4:28-30 we read:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Do not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation."</p>
<p>&nbsp;We would do well to follow Nephi's example when we are discouraged. Contemplate and remember your many blessings. No longer droop in sin, but rather rejoice in the rock of our salvation. The Lord has given us these reassuring words, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Dozens of times we are commanded in the scriptures to be of good cheer. And like Nephi, we know that "the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Let's choose to be obedience. Let's choose to be of good cheer-to be happy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several small, but important acts can make the choice of happiness easier. Count your blessings often. Regular expressions of gratitude will remind us frequently of our many blessings. Counting our blessings will help us treasure those things that promise lasting joy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Go for a hike. I have also found that regular exposure to nature is a concrete reminder of God's majesty and the beauties of creations. It helps me put things in perspective. It helps me to venture beyond the problems that are inches in front of me and helps me to view life with an eternal lens. Put on a happy face. It has been said that if you smile, the world smiles with you. Having a cheerful disposition can dramatically influence how people interact with us. When we are happy, we draw people to us and develop a greater support system. Even a brief exchange of smiles connects us momentarily to others. So make a point to smile. Sometimes our physical actions help determine our deeper emotions.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, these are but a few of the keys to a happy life. "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" reminds us "Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ."<sup>18</sup><em>&nbsp;</em>There are many teachings and "commandments not a few"<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;that will bless us with happiness. Holding to the word of God-the iron rod, will lead us to the tree, "whose fruit is desirable to make one happy."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Nephi and his people studied the word of God as found in the brass plates. And they harkened to the words of their living prophets, whose abridged words strengthen us today.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is also noteworthy that Nephi and his people "did build a temple after the manner of Solomon."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;I believe the temple serves as a symbol of happiness. There we learn about the plan of salivation, which is the great plan of happiness. The covenants we make require our obedience to the commandments. It is a place of service. The ordinances unite families together for eternity. And we are reminded that work is a central part of our mortal experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Surely the temple is a reminder of the principles of happiness. Perhaps this is why President Howard W. Hunter said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"[I invite the] members of the Church to establish the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of their membership and the supernal setting for their most sacred covenants.... I would hope that every adult member would be worthy of-and carry-a current temple recommend, even if proximity to a temple does not allow immediate or frequent use of it."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;Regular temple worship will help us view life through an eternal lens. It will serve as a reminder of the principles and plan of happiness. I pray we will live after the manner of happiness. It won't be easy. There will be hardships, pain, and times of discouragement. But as President Thomas S. Monson has taught, "Let us relish life as we live it, find joy in the journey, and share our love with friends and family."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;I testify the Church is true, and that the way has been prepared. Now let us follow the path to happiness. This is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Department Chair of Business Management</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I came here 10 years ago and immediately experienced something I never remember hearing before. Elder Henry B. Eyring spoke in one of the first devotionals of BYU-Idaho and in the course of his talk he said these words, "I make a prophecy. Now listen carefully" and "...this is a prophecy that I am prepared to make and make solemnly" and "I'll make you a prophecy."<sup>1</sup><br /><br />These were words from an apostle of Jesus Christ who said he had the prophet read over and approve. My thoughts were two-fold: first, "Wow, what a great place this is," and second, I thought I should listen. I did listen and am still quite taken with what he and other leaders have given us at BYU-Idaho. I would like to discuss some of the prophecies President Eyring--then Elder Eyring--made and how you can make those prophecies come true for you individually and collectively.&nbsp;<br /><br />As was mentioned in the introduction, I currently serve as the chair of the Department of Business Management, where we have been working hard to do our part to help fulfill the prophecies. Recently we have been discussing more changes to our program to help our graduates learn and experience the things necessary to help them be what President Erying says they will be. We feel compelled to make these changes. So, when I thought about what might be most helpful to talk to you about, I decided I would talk about what you can do to help ensure that these prophecies are fulfilled in your lives so you can make the most of your education.&nbsp;<br /><br />To help you determine a course of action that will help you make the most out of your education, I am going to introduce you to a tool we use often use in business called a "SWOT analysis."&nbsp; "SWOT" stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The basic idea is to match strengths with opportunities so you can choose a course of action that will have the best chance to succeed. If you don't have any strengths that match well with available opportunities, you make the effort to transform one or more of your weaknesses into strengths.&nbsp;<br /><br />To illustrate how to use this tool, I am going to tell you about a situation where I used it in a non-business setting. When my son was in third grade, I believe, I was asked to coach his community league basketball team because they had a few more boys than they expected and needed one more coach for these boys.&nbsp;These were not the boys who were fought over by the other coaches. They were the ones who for one reason or another signed up late and needed a coach. I called a practice and had the boys just shoot around for the first five or 10 minutes so I could see what I had to work with.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I watched, I became a little concerned. They made almost no shots, they weren't even being guarded, and I could see that they weren't very tall. They couldn't dribble the ball very well either. All I could see was weaknesses. I thought, "This is going to be a long season." I wondered why I ever agreed to coach this team. But I had agreed to coach them, so I tried hard to look for strengths. Eventually I noticed a few of the boys were quite quick, which was about the only strength I could find.&nbsp;<br /><br />At this point, I had a long list of weaknesses and only one strength, so mentally I turned to the opportunities and threats part of the tool. I had to go on my knowledge of and assumptions about the other teams. I was sure many of the other boys could shoot much better (a threat) and had to be taller (another threat), but I was also sure that at that age, they couldn't dribble the ball too well. There was my opportunity. We could capitalize on their inability to handle the ball. I decided to match our quickness strength with the lack of ball handling ability of the other teams to come up with a strategy. In practice, we focused almost entirely on stealing the ball, dribbling it down the court, and making layups. The zone defense we used was one designed to steal the ball, but it wasn't very good if the other team got the ball into the middle to the "big" players.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We worked on other areas of the game minimally but mostly focused those three things--stealing the ball, dribbling, and making layups. As it turned out, our boys did quite well. When the other team passed half court, our boys went into "attack mode." More often than not, they stole the ball, dribbled down court, and missed their layup. But sometimes they made it. This little team of vertically challenged boys who couldn't shoot too well won all their games but one. They took what they had, matched it with attractive opportunities, and made the best of their basketball season.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's see if we can do the same for you and your education at BYU-Idaho. I will reverse the order this time because I don't have the ability to evaluate your individual strengths and weaknesses and more importantly because we have been given help in identifying the opportunities. This help comes from the Lord through his servants because of the Lord's concern for you and for what you can do to help his other children.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the talk entitled "A Steady, Upward Course," President Eyring discussed a number of characteristics of BYU-Idaho graduates. When talking about these characteristics, he used the words I mentioned at the beginning of this talk: "I prophecy." He also implied that people with these characteristics will be in great demand by employers and wards and stakes throughout the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />These opportunities are sure. I would encourage you to read the talk, because you will find things I didn't mention and the Holy Ghost will teach you things that are specific to you. The talk can be found on the BYU-Idaho website under the devotional archive, dated September 18, 2011. For now, let me point out a few items that I feel apply directly to you. He says the world is hungry for people who are the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the shortness of time, I will briefly mention a few of the traits and go more in depth on one as a pattern of what you should or could do on the others.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Innovative and Frugal</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />With the speed of change in technology and business and the state of the economy, employers will seek out those who can do more with less. Graduates of BYU-Idaho will fill those needs for many organizations throughout the world. They will become legendary in their ability to think of new and better ways of doing things without requiring an increased budget. President Erying said, "...they will bless others wherever they go by what they have learned about innovating with scarce resources and treating all they have as if it were the Lord's."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Learners and Teachers</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Once again, the speed of change in technology and business will cause organizations to hire those who can continue learning and teach others what they have learned. "They will be natural leaders who know how to teach and how to learn." They "will become life-long teachers in their families, in the Church, and in their work...."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Natural Leaders</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />This is one I will go into more depth on. What is a natural leader? Here are some statements I pulled out of President Eyring's talk about being natural leaders. He said,&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve." ... "the day will come that that capacity to influence people around you for good will have you singled out as one of the great leaders in whatever place you're in." ... "I hope I live long enough to meet some employer who employed one of you and says, 'Where did that come from? I've never had such a person. Why people just flock around that person. And they want to follow. They don't have to be led; they're seeking to go where that person wants to go....'"<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>President Clark elaborated on this type of leadership in a graduation talk entitled "Leadership with a Small 'L'." He explained how this type of leadership is the type of leadership that Christ leads with: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The call to be a disciple-leader is a call to minister and to serve. It is a call to lead as Christ leads. It is leadership with a small 'L'-the kind of leadership that builds and lifts and inspires through kindness and love and unselfish devotion to the Lord and His work. It is the kind of leadership that we need at every level of every kind of organization in the world and in every ward and stake in the Church. It is the kind of leadership you will need to build an eternal family."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Natural or small "L" leaders often are not in formal positions of authority. The world has a great need of natural leaders. The opportunity is there and it was stated by an disciple of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's turn to you and your strengths and weaknesses. Do you have the strength of natural leadership to match with opportunities the world provides for those who do? By the way, in my 10 years of teaching here, I have known enough students and kept track of their lives after graduation to know the prophecies are being fulfilled and will continued to be fulfilled to even a greater degree. Many of our graduates have become wonderful natural leaders. However, the degree to which the prophecy will be fulfilled in your life depends on you and the course of action you decide on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When you heard me describe what a natural leader is, did you think that describes you? Did you look back at your mission or Laurels or your high school experience and say, "that's me!" If you did, in all humility, then you have a strength or at least the potential of a strength. You are in a good position to build on that strength, and in a minute, I will give you a few ideas on how to do that.&nbsp;<br /><br />If, when you heard the descriptions of a natural leader, you thought "That is not me," then you have got a mismatch--a weakness aligned with an opportunity. You will need to change. BYU-Idaho is all about change. The gospel is all about change. You can change. You may never be the best natural leader in the world, but I testify to you that you can and, in almost all cases, should change. In the Book of Ether, Moroni talked about weakness. He said,&nbsp;<br /><br />"And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I will give you a few ideas on how to make that change. Ammon, one of the sons of Mosiah, was a natural leader.&nbsp;Lamoni, many of his people, Lamoni's father and many of his people followed Ammon even when it was very difficult to follow him. I know you might be thinking that his situation was quite a bit different, and in some ways I am sure you are right. For instance, you probably won't have to disarm you enemies the way he did, but I will refer back to Ammon as an example of someone who did what he needed so he could be a great natural leader. Incidentally, he wasn't in a formal position of leadership, in fact, he first met Lamoni as a bound prisoner.&nbsp;To become the type of leader President Eyring prophesied you can be, you need to do the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Be a Faithful Disciple of Jesus Christ</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />To become a natural leader or an innovator or a chemist or a businessperson you need to live worthy and have faith so you can take advantage of a Church university. You learn so much faster and so much better if you learn by study and by faith. President Eyring said,&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The students-you and those who follow you-must play a major part. It is their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His restored gospel and their obedience to His commandments that will put Him at the center of the school. Their faith will largely determine whether we learn here by study and also by faith. As we do, we will attain academic excellence. We will not attain academic excellence without that faith of yours as students and those that follow to learn by study and by faith."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, instructors like me can only do what we are supposed to with your faithful help.&nbsp; President Eyring continued to say, "Your teachers will teach better than their natural capacities would ever allow them to do because the powers of heaven will come down. They will come down because of your faith."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Ammon exhibited great faith in Jesus Christ. In fact, he and his brothers worked tirelessly to bring the people in the land of Zarahemla to a knowledge of Jesus Christ:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them. And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>We need the Lord's help. We need to be faithful disciples of Jesus Christ. Not only is our learning made better, people want to follow those who have the light of Christ about them. When I was a freshman at BYU, many of the young men in my dorm were athletic, stylish, and apparently attractive to the girls--the things that I desired to be, but they seemed think to be cool, they needed to be a bit rowdy and rebellious.&nbsp;<br /><br />I had not been around members of the Church very much. I had hoped I wouldn't have to still fight that battle between being accepted and being righteous. But I came to know one who was different. His name was Corey Brink, I believe. He was athletic. He dated a lot. But he also fulfilled his calling and obeyed the rules and was genuinely interested in others. I wanted to be like him. He helped me raise my sights and expectations even though he didn't know me very well. I wanted to follow him because he was a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. I needed to see an example like that.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Desire to Lift Others</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>I have found people are much more inclined to want to go where you are going if they believe that you care about them. President Eyring said, "We will see the greatest work of our lives as nurturing others as the Savior did. We will see the potential in others as He sees it."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;He further talked about an attitude change that might be required when he said,&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"You will know that the reason you are being singled out is not because of your innate gifts as a leader but because you have done what the Savior would do-learned how to, and did, reach out to those around you to try to lift them, to help them to be better even when it might be a little bit difficult and you might not have been received very well."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Ammon wanted to help Lamoni and his people even as they threatened to put him to death. In Alma 17: 23 when he was brought bound before King Lamoni and asked why he was in their land, he answered by saying "...yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;What a great answer-a highly likely outcome of his meeting with the king was death. Even better, was that he was willing to risk his life to share the gospel with Lamoni and his people. He cared. So can you. Many of you did on your missions or do now in your callings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Start Now</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />President Kimball would have said, "do it." Elder Bednar would say, "act rather than being acted upon." In his October 2005 General Conference address entitled "Becoming a Missionary," Elder Bednar said the best way to prepare for a mission is to start becoming a missionary now.&nbsp; To become a missionary "...you can increase in your desire to serve God (see D&amp;C 4:3), and you can begin to think as missionaries think, to read what missionaries read, to pray as missionaries pray, and to feel what missionaries feel."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;The same is true of natural leaders.&nbsp;<br /><br />You need to start now to do what a natural leader does. You could dress up for and bring your scriptures to devotional and encourage others to do the same. When working in teams in your classes, you could do your part and help the team member who isn't doing his or her fair share to increase his contribution because of the extra concern you show him. When participating in a class discussion, you could build on previous comments by sincerely praising the person's point of view even if it is different than your point of view. You can start now to become a natural leader rather than hoping that it will all kick in immediately after graduation.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Choose Wisely</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />You can also choose a major, elective courses, and activities that will help you personally develop your natural leadership abilities. You can choose to prepare for a job where they need natural leaders and where you can further develop your leadership abilities. Ammon and his brothers chose a course of action based on the words of a prophet where they could use their abilities, including natural leadership, to have a great influence.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />They did this based on the promise of the Lord delivered to them by His servant King Mosiah after requesting permission to teach the gospel to the Lamanites. "And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;You can exercise your agency to choose an education and career path that will enhance your natural leadership skills.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Like the youth basketball team I coached, success is more likely if you match strengths with opportunities, and in your case, the opportunities were identified by a prophet, seer, and revelator. You just need to do your part to fulfill the prophecy.&nbsp;I testify the Lord cares about you and rest of His children, and that He needs you to help them. I also testify that He is very concerned about the work here at BYU-Idaho. I know the Savior lives and that His atonement is the way to positive change. I know the Church is true. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>I relay to you the love and appreciation of President Clark. He is recovering well and appreciates your prayers and thoughts in his behalf. They are felt. It is a great privilege to express our thanks to each of you this evening. We know BYU&ndash;Idaho could not be without your love and devotion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several months ago I received a phone call from my brother who served as a ward mission leader. He had been with a full-time missionary visiting less active families that night and said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get home to tell what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As they introduced themselves to the couple they were visiting, the husband asked, &ldquo;Are you related to a Kim&ndash;&ndash;or something like that&ndash;&ndash;Miyasaki who worked at Ricks College?&rdquo; Rick responded, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my brother.&rdquo; The husband proclaimed, &ldquo;He kicked me out of school.&rdquo; And then his wife chimed in, &ldquo;He kicked me out also.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They went on to explain they both deserved to be dismissed and shared some chuckles with my brother about the coincidence of meeting up with a relative whose mission it was now to draw them back in the fold. It ended up being a good discussion and as the missionary and my brother returned to the car, the missionary said to my brother, &ldquo;Your brother kicked me out of school too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow, a triple play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I travel about I always love to wear a BYU&ndash;Idaho shirt or carry something that speaks of this great school. Many of you probably do the same. I am always amazed of the attention this gets, and sometimes I get the person who says, &ldquo;Do you remember me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t recognize them I usually respond, &ldquo;Was it good or bad?&rdquo; Having spent most of my years at BYU&ndash;Idaho as the Registrar, Dean of Students, and in the Student Honor Office has made me a little gun shy. Most often the response is, &ldquo;It was good,&rdquo; but surprisingly many times the circumstances of my acquaintance were not good. These students tell me how they have changed and how their Rexburg experience was the crossroad of their life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a strong testimony that every student and employee at BYU&ndash;Idaho was led here by the hand of the Lord. I see witnesses of this daily. Because this is an institution of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have opportunity to be as Nephi, and be &ldquo;led by the Spirit,&rdquo; and even doing so by faith, &ldquo;not knowing beforehand the things which we<em> </em>should do&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar said, &ldquo;We are not like other institutions of higher education; we have access to the gifts of the Spirit, which cannot be quantified nor counted.&rdquo; President Henry B. Eyring taught, &ldquo;We will see the potential in others as He sees it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working in the Student Honor office in the early years of my employment, I recall a young man who lived in the men&rsquo;s dorms and was referred after many suspected he was engaged in smoking, breaking curfew, and many other violations. He vehemently denied the allegations, and commented how we lacked trust in our students with our &ldquo;silly rules.&rdquo; In a short time a second report came to my office that he was witnessed using alcohol and marijuana. This time he openly admitted to his disobedient behavior and began mocking the College and the Church in a very disrespectful manner. I recall having a feeling come over me of a love for this young man. I literally saw him as a Son of God and sensed our Father&rsquo;s love for him. In the midst of his mudslinging I interrupted him, and told him of my witness that he was God&rsquo;s son, He loved him, and he was supposed to be here at Ricks College to learn some important lessons. This young man responded by calling me some very disgusting names, stood up, and walked out the door, slamming it behind him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recall sitting there feeling pity for this young man and his heartbroken parents. Some five years later, I received a letter from this young man&rsquo;s parents. It told of how this young man never returned home, and instead went to a large city basically living a life of sin. In a very sorry state, hungry and alone, he entered a public bus one night. The driver noted the young man, and at one stop asked if he would be interested in a hot meal as he was ending his shift. He accepted the offer, and the bus driver took him to his home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bus driver just happened to be a member of the Church. He would later explain the Spirit came to him and told him to invite this young man to his home. This was the beginning of a journey of repentance, a completion of a full-time mission, and eventually a request from the parents and the son for consideration to return to BYU&ndash;Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Alma 17, as it describes the mission of the sons of Mosiah going to a people who were wild, hardened, ferocious, and delighted in the murdering of the Nephites, one wonders what were these young men thinking. However, I believe we find the answer in this description of these valiant missionaries, &ldquo;&hellip;they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These stalwart missionaries were blessed to see the Lamanites not as they were in man&rsquo;s eyes, but rather through the spirit of prophecy and the spirit of revelation, they saw them as their brethren.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brother and sisters, though we do not encounter in our classrooms and on our campus the variety of character who delight in murder, from time to time we do see those who are wild and hardened, but more frequently we see youth who have not yet quite got it. They have been so involved in the world they measure their worth to standards that have no intrinsic value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul taught, &ldquo;While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:18).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that day when I met with the student as he was being suspended by Ricks College despite his hardness, I had the spirit of revelation to see him as a son of God. And I had revealed to me that day the love of Heavenly Father. It was by this same spirit of revelation the bus driver responded. It is what meant by President Eyring, &ldquo;You will see the potential in others as He sees it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I invite each of us, prior to the start of the semester, to read over Doctrine and Covenants 46. As you study, ponder, and pray regarding the gifts you desire and are required for your particular stewardship, consider the procedure outlined by the Lord in the latter verses of this section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In verse 28 it states, &ldquo;&hellip;he that asketh in Spirit shall receive in Spirit.&rdquo; This causes one to ask, &ldquo;What does it mean to ask in Spirit?&rdquo; The pattern is taught in verses 30 through 33. First, we learn that he that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of God. In determining what spiritual gifts we desire it is crucial to discern what gifts are those that are in accordance to God&rsquo;s will as opposed to our own desires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul teaches, &ldquo;Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.&nbsp; And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, we learn, all things must be done in the name of Christ. Doing things in the name Christ is not just merely closing our prayers in his sacred name, but entails much more. The Bible Dictionary teaches, &ldquo;We pray in Christ&rsquo;s name when our mind is the mind of Christ, and our wishes the wishes of Christ, and his words abide in us. We then ask for things it is possible for God to grant. Many prayers remain unanswered because they are not in Christ&rsquo;s name at all; they in no way represent his mind, but spring out of the selfishness of man&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, we must give thanks unto God in the Spirit for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with. Again, the key is we give our thanks in the Spirit. When we contemplate the many blessings we have been given by the Father, we then open the door to be taught by the Spirit. Elder Bednar offered this invitation: &ldquo;Let me recommend that periodically you and I offer a prayer in which we only give thanks and express gratitude. Ask for nothing; simply let our souls rejoice and strive to communicate appreciation with all the energy of our hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, the Lord states, &ldquo;And ye must practice virtue and holiness before me continuously. Even so, Amen.&rdquo; Next week, I will teach all of the new beginning students the principles of Personal Honor. The tagline of &ldquo;True at all Times&rdquo; is certainly a creed for all of us at BYU&ndash;Idaho and it is the predicator of the blessings the Lord awaits to grant unto us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify the mission and purpose of this wonderful institution is in accordance to the will of our Father. We are part of the Kingdom of God. Each of us is here by the hand of the Lord. May we be blessed with gifts of the Spirit to be tools in God&rsquo;s work, a great and marvelous work.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to you today. &nbsp;I am thankful for you and want to express my love and gratitude for your support and prayers. &nbsp;I love you very much and look forward to the opportunity to be with you again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel impressed to share with you a thought and a promise. &nbsp;A couple of years ago I invited you to do four things: begin each class with prayer; attend devotional; be exemplary in your dress and demeanor; and take the opportunity to teach your students about their covenants and their promises.&nbsp; You have acted on that invitation, and I want you to know what a great impact you are having on our students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the promise:&nbsp; as you continue to do these things, the Lord will work through you to save souls. &nbsp;I know that your students will watch you. &nbsp;They will be influenced not only by what you say to them, but also by what you do. &nbsp;If you do these four things, you will help them and save them. &nbsp;I know that&rsquo;s true. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I would like to share a few thoughts with you about learning and teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning:&nbsp; Increasing Power&mdash;To Know, To Do, and To Become</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My starting point is a concept of learning based on a talk given in 2000 by Elder Dallin H. Oaks entitled &ldquo;The Challenge to Become.&rdquo; Elder Oaks said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul taught that the Lord&rsquo;s teachings and teachers were given that we may all attain &ldquo;the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 4:13).&nbsp; This process requires far more than acquiring knowledge. &nbsp;It is not even enough for us to be <em>convinced</em> of the gospel; we must act and think so that we are <em>converted</em> by it.&nbsp; In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us to <em>know</em> something, the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to <em>become</em> something. . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To testify is to <em>know</em> and to <em>declare.</em> &nbsp;The gospel challenges us to be &ldquo;converted,&rdquo; which requires us to <em>do</em> and to <em>become.</em> &nbsp;If any of us relies solely upon our knowledge and testimony of the gospel, we are in the same position as the blessed but still unfinished Apostles whom Jesus challenged to be &ldquo;converted.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found this framework very useful in thinking about learning in the university. When I speak of learning today, I speak of it as an increase in the capacity or power to Know,<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;to Do, and to Become.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This concept of learning applies to every field of study in the university. &nbsp;We, of course, want our students to become disciples of the Savior and leaders in their families and in the kingdom.&nbsp; But we also want them to learn in this deep sense in Foundations and in their major fields of study. &nbsp;In every major there is a Know-Do-Become pattern that applies to that field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deep learning of this kind only comes with diligence on the part of the learner&mdash; seeking, knocking, and searching in the Light of Christ and by the power of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;It comes under the guidance and direction of inspired teachers.&nbsp; It comes when we gather together to learn together in bonds of charity. &nbsp;It comes when we act in faith to step out beyond what we already know trusting that the light will come&mdash;that we will come to know, and then do, and then become.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe we teach with inspiration and learn deeply&mdash;to Know, to Do, and to Become&mdash;only in so far as the Atonement of Christ works in our lives purifying, sanctifying, and qualifying us to receive His grace and the gifts He has prepared for us. &nbsp;The learner must work and seek diligently, but it is only in and through the atoning blood of Christ that the light comes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is in that context that the Savior&rsquo;s marvelous commandment and promise to those who teach in His kingdom has special meaning:</p>
<p>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we humble ourselves before the Lord, seek His help, and act in faith to diligently do what is in our power, we qualify for the enabling or strengthening power of the Atonement of Christ.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; Through His marvelous grace we may receive His power and His strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I encourage you to pay particular attention to the word &ldquo;attend&rdquo; in the Lord&rsquo;s promise.&nbsp; Attend means to wait upon, to accompany, to take care of, to minister, to watch over, to look after.&nbsp; When the Lord promises &ldquo;my grace shall attend you,&rdquo; He is promising to walk with us, to minister to us, to watch over and care for us with His almighty power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In His agony and suffering Jesus descended below all things and rose triumphant over all things.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; He received from His Father all power both in heaven and in earth.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; He blesses us with His power and bestows upon us the ministry of angels and spiritual gifts of discernment and insight, wisdom and judgment, patience and love.&nbsp; When we feel we are doing all we can do but nevertheless move forward in faith to do His will, the Savior works miracles in our lives.&nbsp; He reaches for us and lifts us and strengthens us so that we have capacity to do much more than we could do on our own.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp; This is the grace of Christ, and it is essential to deep learning and inspired teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning is a Spiritual Experience&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I would like to say a word about our students. &nbsp;We are blessed to work with wonderful young people. &nbsp;They bring a wide range of abilities and also a wide range of interests in learning. &nbsp;We know that the students are children of God. &nbsp;We know they were born to learn. &nbsp;We know if the Atonement is working in their lives, their potential for learning is unbounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we know who our students really are and because we, too, have access to the grace of the Savior, we can help them Know, and Do, and Become just the way the Lord wants. &nbsp;As I have thought about the influence that we have on them, I am reminded of a talk President Eyring gave many years ago entitled &ldquo;Teaching is a Moral Act.&rdquo; &nbsp;In the talk he quotes one of his Harvard professors, C. Roland Christensen, about students and learning. &nbsp;This is Professor Christensen:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe in the unlimited potential of every student.&nbsp; At first glance they range, like instructors, from mediocre to magnificent.&nbsp; But potential is invisible to the superficial gaze.&nbsp; It takes faith to discern it, but I have witnessed too many academic miracles to doubt its existence.&nbsp; I now view each student as &lsquo;material for a work of art.&rsquo; &nbsp;If I have faith, deep faith, in students&rsquo; capacities for creativity and growth, how very much we can accomplish together.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, I fail to believe in that potential, my failure sows seeds of doubt.&nbsp; Students read our negative signals, however carefully cloaked, and retreat from creative risk to the &lsquo;just possible.&rsquo; &nbsp;When this happens, everyone loses.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we ponder the unbounded potential of our students, I think it is important to recognize that learning is a conversion experience.&nbsp; Learning is, in its very nature, a spiritual experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first place, the Light of Christ mediates all learning of this kind.&nbsp; The Lord taught the Prophet Joseph that the Light of Christ is &ldquo;the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings.&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more power comes to those who qualify for the companionship of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; As the Lord taught: But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things . . . .<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, deep learning engages the total person&mdash;the immortal spirit, the heart, the mind, and the body.&nbsp; It involves changing the way the student sees and understands the world, but also affects attitudes and values and the student&rsquo;s virtues and character.</p>
<p>It is for both of these reasons that I believe deep learning is a spiritual experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning Through Inspired Teaching</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Since learning is a spiritual experience that depends on the Atonement of Christ, it makes sense that teaching that leads to such learning also is a spiritual experience and depends for its power and success on the Atonement of the Savior. &nbsp;To teach diligently, therefore, means:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we do these things, His grace will attend us.&nbsp; He will magnify our efforts and lift us and our students beyond our own talent and capacity to a much higher level of performance and a much deeper learning than we could ever achieve on our own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen you teach diligently in just this way over and over again, for a long time. This pattern is at the heart of BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; It is a pattern of faith in the Savior. &nbsp;It is a pattern of the broken heart and the contrite spirit. &nbsp;It is a pattern of consecration, obedience, sacrifice, and professional competence. &nbsp;It is a pattern of love for the Lord and for the students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me quote President Eyring about teachers and students and this love:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students, when they learn, have an experience like discovery.&nbsp; It can be frightening to them. &nbsp;To them, that first course in a subject is an unknown continent, strange and frightening and threatening, because not only is it hard to learn, but exploring it may convince them that they can&rsquo;t learn. &nbsp;It may tell them something about themselves that can devastate them. &nbsp;The teachers who will make the difference are the ones who somehow can enter into that world with the student and feel what they feel, know what they fear, care about their fear, and help them move through the fear to learning.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, through the Atonement of Christ, we can enter into the world of the student, with love for him or her and for the Lord. &nbsp;When we do, we can indeed help the student learn. &nbsp;You know that because you have been doing just that. &nbsp;It is who you are. &nbsp;It is your identity as teachers for the Lord. &nbsp;And some of you have been doing it for a long, long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning About Learning</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I am convinced the Lord is reaching out to us to lift us to even higher ground. &nbsp;He has prepared the way for us to become much more effective and powerful in our learning and in our teaching. &nbsp;The way forward is for us to do ourselves exactly what we want our students to do&mdash;to act in faith in Christ to diligently seek increased power to Know, to Do and to Become the learners and teachers the Lord has prepared us to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a time for each of us to act&mdash;to find out and then do what the Lord wants done. &nbsp;We are empowered to learn, to increase in capacity and power. &nbsp;I am confident the Lord will guide each of us and bless us according to our desire to learn and our faith and diligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe we learn about learning and teaching and become the Lord&rsquo;s teachers in two ways. &nbsp;Both are essential; neither is sufficient in itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is individual learning. &nbsp;As a teacher you have many, many opportunities to learn from your own experience. &nbsp;Learning of this kind occurs as you reflect on your experience, get ideas about things to change, and then make adjustments and observe the outcomes. &nbsp;This kind of learning goes on all across the university. &nbsp;It is the stuff and substance of our daily walk. &nbsp;It is critical to the progress of the university on the steady, upward course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second kind of learning occurs when we work together in systematic inquiry directed at learning. &nbsp;Ten years ago Elder David A. Bednar spoke at a faculty meeting on this topic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my mind the overarching theme for all of our scholarly work at Brigham Young University-Idaho should be inspired inquiry and innovation.&nbsp; . . . Our scholarship should be focused on the processes of learning and teaching.&nbsp; We will not be a recognized and highly regarded research institution. . . .&nbsp; We will, however, emphasize a wide range of scholarly endeavors and excel in and play a pioneering role in understanding learning and teaching processes with faith and hard work, and in the process of time.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is systematic inquiry. &nbsp;It is a set of directed learning activities, including experiments, collection and analysis of data, observation, action research, and much else. &nbsp;It is most effective when conducted by a group of faculty who bring diverse experiences and perspectives. &nbsp;It can be done in departments and colleges, but may be even more powerful when done by faculty from across the university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of you have been doing this for a long time and doing it very, very well. &nbsp;For example, we continue to see wonderful work coming out of the CFS (continuing faculty status) process. &nbsp;In addition, over the last two years under the leadership of Kelly Burgener, the deans and chairs have created more formal mechanisms to foster and sustain this kind of systematic inquiry. &nbsp;Driven by a profound belief that the scholarship of learning and teaching is a primary responsibility of all faculty, a growing number of deans and chairs have begun to incorporate discussions of the scholarship of learning and teaching into their meetings. &nbsp;Out of that have grown a number of new initiatives, including teaching teams, retreats focused on learning, and so forth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also seen some wonderful things happening in our Foundations teaching teams, in the Learning and Teaching Council and its various committees, in the recently launched effort in outcomes for programs and courses, and in our work in Online Learning.&nbsp; As we move now to develop and implement more hybrid courses involving elements of both face-to-face and online learning, we will have a rich opportunity to deepen our understanding of learning and teaching in all modes of delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the primary focus of our inspired inquiry and innovation will be on the processes of learning and teaching, we also need to learn about curriculum, including the content and design of individual courses as well as the design of programs and majors.</p>
<p>There is much to learn about learning and teaching, but there is another important benefit of systematic inquiry. &nbsp;When we do this kind of work, especially when we do it in small groups of faculty (with support from students), we also will increase in our capacity to collaborate.&nbsp; As we get better at collaboration, the quality of our inquiry and scholarship will increase and we will get better at collaboration. &nbsp;This becomes a virtuous cycle of great power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I suggest some things you might do to engage in this great learning process?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recognize that going where we need to go will require investment.&nbsp; There must be investment in faculty development and in new designs for courses, in new modules, and in new materials.&nbsp; This takes time and resources.&nbsp; Over the next several months, you will hear much more about this.&nbsp; I am confident the Lord has prepared the way; in the great spirit of frugality that has always characterized this place, I believe we will have the modest resources we will need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Prophecy of John Taylor</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When John Taylor was President of the Church, he made this remarkable prophecy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters.&nbsp; You mark my words, and write them down, and see if they do not come to pass.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe BYU-Idaho will be an important part of the fulfillment of that prophecy in our day.&nbsp; I take President Taylor at his word: if we continue to build Zion here, the Lord will bless us with new understanding of learning of every kind. &nbsp;With it will come new understanding of teaching, and the Lord will bless us to know how to implement what we learn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have three great blessings from the Lord as we pursue this work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, it will not be just a few who will do this. &nbsp;Hundreds of faculty will be engaged, both on the campus in Rexburg and among our many online instructors. &nbsp;Many, many other employees who teach and work with students will be involved. &nbsp;We will have a literal army of students who will participate in this work. &nbsp;The entire university will be a place of inspired inquiry and innovation in learning and teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, we will have an integrated curriculum with common designs across many different modes of delivery&mdash;face-to-face, hybrid, online, competency. &nbsp;This is a great blessing. &nbsp;Out of it will come rich, comparable data on common outcomes and common assessments. &nbsp;Out of it will come a rich context for experiments and action research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, and most importantly, we have the supernal blessing of the Lord&rsquo;s grace. &nbsp;His grace will attend us. &nbsp;The Holy Ghost will minister here in our work on learning and teaching; and the Lord will watch over us, guide us, and strengthen us beyond our own talents and capacities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have been prepared to receive these great blessings. &nbsp;Ten years ago Elder Bednar saw it.&nbsp; I reaffirm it today&mdash;this university will be a beacon on a hill. &nbsp;It will be a light in a dark world, a light of learning and teaching. &nbsp;It will come with hard work and diligent seeking. &nbsp;It will come because of your faith in Jesus Christ, your submission to His will, your humility, your consecration, your willingness to sacrifice, and your devotion to the Lord. &nbsp;It will come because we will be focused on blessing the lives of our students, and students everywhere, with our eyes single to the glory of God. &nbsp;It will come because of the grace of the Redeemer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear witness of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;In sacred moments in recent days, I have felt the power of His mercy and His grace. &nbsp;I know He lives. &nbsp;I know He watches over our families and over us. &nbsp;May our Father and His Beloved Son bless us to rise to the great privileges They have prepared for us is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> A more complete statement of this framework would incorporate different kinds of knowledge. For example, it might be sufficient to distinguish between Know What &ndash; facts, categories, distinctions and so forth; Know How &ndash; skill in applying knowledge to accomplish something; and Know Why &ndash; fundamental concepts and principles, root causes, and so forth. &nbsp;A simple example:&nbsp; 1) We might learn what a lens is, including its parts, and its function; this is Know What.&nbsp; 2) We might learn how to design a simple lens to accomplish a particular purpose; this is Know How.&nbsp; 3) We might learn about the properties of light, its interaction with materials placed in a particular form defining curvature and thickness, and the principles of optics that govern those interactions to produce the effect of the lens; this is Know Why.</p>

<p>BYU-Idaho Advancement Vice President</p>
<p>Henry and his family have had a long association with Rexburg and BYU-Idaho. He first came to the Upper Snake River Valley as a child, when his father, President Henry B. Eyring, served as president of Ricks College. He and his family were in Rexburg to assist with the clean-up efforts following the Teton Dam disaster in 1976. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Henry returned to Rexburg and the relatively new BYU-Idaho in 2006. Over the ensuing eleven years at the university, he has served as Associate Academic Vice President over Online Learning, Advancement Vice President, and Academic Vice President.<br /><br />Previous to his work at BYU-Idaho, Henry worked as a strategy consultant at Monitor Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and as MBA Director at BYU in Provo.<br /><br />Henry has served in various callings in the Church, including full-time missionary in the Japan&shy; &shy;Nagoya Mission, bishop, Mission President in the Tokyo Japan North Mission, and President of the Rexburg Idaho YSA 6th&nbsp;Stake.<br /><br />Henry earned a bachelor's degree in Geology, a Master of Business Administration, and a Juris Doctorate from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. While attending BYU, he married his high school sweetheart, Kelly Ann Child.<br /><br />Kelly graduated from BYU with a bachelor's degree in English. She has served as a stake Young Women president, Primary president, and is currently serving as a Laurel adviser. President and Sister Eyring are the parents of five children. Their three oldest children are graduates of BYU-Idaho, and their younger two children still live at home.&nbsp;They also have two grandchildren with a third on the way.&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>
<p>I am grateful for the assignment to speak today. I have been richly blessed in my preparations to talk about the importance of stewardship. I have learned more about what it means to be a steward in the Lord's kingdom. I have also been reminded of the special stewardships we have as members of the BYU-Idaho community.<br /><br /><strong>The Definition of Stewardship</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />If your experience is like mine, you've understood that we Church members are expected to be faithful and wise stewards, but you may have wondered what exactly that means. The word steward is one we don't often hear outside of the Church. The first time I remember hearing the word steward was in the ninth grade, when I began to read a trilogy of books called&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. The story includes two brothers, Boromir and Faramir, who are sons of a steward. Their father leads a kingdom in the absence of the king. Each of the brothers is tempted by the prospect of power. Faramir handles the temptations better than his older brother Boromir, but each young steward is ultimately true, sacrificing his personal interests and even putting his life at risk for others.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ninth grade was also the beginning of my seminary experience. The course of study that year was the Doctrine and Covenants. We learned that the covenants we make as Church members come with stewardship responsibilities. The Lord teaches that principle in the 104th&nbsp;Section: "[V]erily I say unto you, I have appointed unto you to be stewards over mine house, even stewards indeed."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The stewardships we receive from the Lord comprise temporal as well as spiritual gifts; we have responsibility not only for tangible things but also for the needs of others and for our individual talents and time. These stewardships come with the duty to account, both now and in the next life. The 72nd&nbsp;Section of the Doctrine and Covenants teaches that, "[I]t is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Doctrine and Covenants also reiterates a principle that we learn from the parable of the talents. Being a good steward means not just preserving and protecting the gifts we have been given, but building upon them and sharing them. In the 82nd&nbsp;Section the Lord explains that we receive stewardships "for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the Lord's storehouse, to become the property of the whole church-Every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye to the glory of God."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In seminary my classmates and I learned about men such as Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, and John Taylor, who honored their stewardships even when it required great sacrifice. They put the welfare of others ahead of their own. Their sacrifices helped establish the Church and assured them eternal joy. We also learned of other Church leaders who enjoyed similar spiritual blessings but failed as stewards and suffered great sorrow as a result.&nbsp;<br /><br />A few years later, in law school, my classmates and I made a formal study of stewardship, or what lawyers call the "principal-agent relationship." We learned that an agent, or legal steward, has both power and responsibility. When this kind of steward's authorization is publicly known, what he or she says or does is legally binding, just as though the one granting the stewardship, the principal, had said or done it. The legal steward has a related duty of loyalty to the principal and must exercise due care in all words and deeds.&nbsp; Failure to honor that duty makes him personally liable.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a law school student I failed to connect the concept of legal stewardship to the sacrament prayers that we hear each week. But the elements of a stewardship relationship are clear in those prayers. As we partake of the sacrament, we make three promises. First, we take upon ourselves the Lord's name.&nbsp; This means that we agree to be known to the world as His stewards. Second, we promise to always remember Him. This means always thinking about His plans and preferences. Finally, we commit to keep His commandments. This means acting as He has instructed us to do.&nbsp;<br /><br />Though we renew this covenant of stewardship every week, we may not think of it that way. It is natural to see ourselves as stewards when we receive a formal calling or leadership responsibility, such as ward Relief Society president or zone leader in the mission field. We might even see the importance of our stewardship as a home or visiting teacher. But it can be difficult to think of ourselves as stewards at all times and under all circumstances.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Full-fledged Stewardship</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />My given name has led me to think a lot about this kind of all-encompassing stewardship. It might surprise you to learn how often someone I don't know walks up and asks me whether I'm related to my father, President Henry B. Eyring. (All right, maybe it wouldn't surprise you that much.) Some people actually mistake me for my father.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, several years ago on this campus, I passed a young woman who was walking in the opposite direction. She stared at me, and I knew what she was thinking. She passed out of my sight, but then I heard a squeal behind me. Before I could turn around, I felt an arm wrapping around one of mine. The young woman looked up at me with a big smile, and said, "I'll bet I know who yo-ou are!" Caught off-guard by her forwardness, I looked down and said, "I'll bet you do-on't!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Throughout my life I have been conscious of my name. Henry was not a common name for young Californians in the 1960s. In fact, thanks to Herman's Hermits and their hit song, "I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am," even my friends liked to have fun with my name.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As I grew older, I had mixed feelings about sharing my father's name. Of course I admired him, but I wanted to be my own person. When we moved to Rexburg in 1971, I hoped to be more than just the son of the President of Ricks College. Even as I tried to emulate my father's many outstanding qualities, I was glad for the differences between us. For example, when I learned that the baldness gene is inherited through a boy's mother, I took great comfort in the thought that my maternal grandfather and uncle had thick, full heads of hair.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, thanks to a relatively rare hair-loss condition called alopecia, I now share both my father's name and his hairstyle. As it happened, my hair fell out in 1995, the year that he was called to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. As his profile in the Church rose, mine seemed to be swallowed up. That was a time of soul-searching for me. After a period of spiritual grumbling and some self-pity, I realized that I had only two choices: I could either resent my name and association with my father or embrace it. Though I might try to ignore the connection to him, those around me wouldn't, and they would continually remind me of it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I began to see that, like it or not, I was in a position of responsibility.&nbsp; If I behaved in ways that my father wouldn't, I could do great damage, not only to him and the Church, but to those who might observe my behavior and have their faith weakened. On the other hand, to the extent that I carried myself as he does and expressed both my love and his to those who approached me as his son, I could build faith and goodwill toward the Church and its leaders. Once I got over my personal pride, the right choice was clear and relatively easy to make. I do not have all of my father's good attributes, but that is not what people expect. I can perform my duty as his son simply by trying my best.&nbsp; And, in the process, I become a better, happier person. My small sacrifice yields rich personal blessings.&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope that you can see how each of us stands in similar relation to our Savior, Jesus Christ. Each of us has taken His name upon us. We have promised to act as His stewards, by always remembering Him and keeping His commandments, especially the commandments to love our Heavenly Father and serve His children. You and I may not have strangers stopping to ask if we are related to Heavenly Father and the Savior. But we have had the experience of being asked what members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe and of being questioned about our personal conduct. We have felt a sense of accomplishment when our answers and conduct were admirable, and we have felt shame when we were not behaving as faithful stewards would.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Stewardship at BYU-Idaho</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />You may have noticed that the scrutiny we receive as stewards is heightened by our affiliation with BYU-Idaho. President Eyring prophesied this. Ten years ago this week, he gave a devotional address here. He called his remarks "A Steady Upward Course." I was not present then, but I have read "A Steady Upward Course" many times. I am fascinated by his focus on us, the students and employees of this day. He said this about us: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"[They] will become life-long teachers in their families, in the Church, and in their work, and they will bless others wherever they go by what they have learned about innovating with scarce resources and treating all they have as if it were the Lord's."</p>
<p>President Eyring spoke particularly of the effect that BYU-Idaho graduates will have on the world.&nbsp; He said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The graduates will be at personal peace by having kept the commandments. &nbsp;They will be natural leaders who know how to teach and how to learn. They will have the power to innovate and improve without requiring more of what money can buy. Those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become...legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>To understand why President Eyring spoke of us as stewards over "scarce resources," it helps to understand the conditions of that day ten years ago. President Eyring and the other leaders of the Church are always sensitive to the use of sacred tithing funds, which cover the majority of the cost of operating this campus. But his awareness of the miracle of tithe-payer faithfulness was particularly high that day. He was speaking on September 18, 2001, one week after the awful September 11 attacks.&nbsp; The national economy was weak even before the terrorists killed nearly 3,000 people and paralyzed the country's air transportation system. In addition to the hijackings, there were terrorist attacks being made through the postal system, via deadly anthrax spores.&nbsp; There was a real risk of economic calamity and a decrease in the flow of tithing funds upon which BYU-Idaho depends.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yet President Eyring took the unique occasion to explain how the Lord's kingdom rolls forward even in the most uncertain and difficult times. Noting that prophets have taught us to expect change in these last days, he pointed to positive aspects of this trend, saying:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We will live for better or for worse with rapid change and the uncertainty it brings.&nbsp; You and I want to make that change work for the better for us and not for the worse...The purpose of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to change [us] so that [we're] not trying to resist change. [We're] trying to have change take [us] where the Lord wants [us] to go."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>BYU-Idaho has changed remarkably in the ten years since President Eyring prophesied of the university's steady upward course. The number of students has more than doubled. Yet even with the addition of four-year degrees, the cost of serving each student has remained essentially the same. That has been made possible by a combination of sacrifices, such as creating a third full semester, as well as innovative use of online learning technology. A spirit of frugality and innovation has allowed us to fulfill President Eyring's promise that, quote:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"[W]e must and will find ways to improve and to innovate that require little or no money. We will depend more upon inspiration and perspiration to make improvements than upon buildings and equipment. Then hard economic times will have little effect on the continuous innovation that will not cease at this school, even in the most difficult times."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><strong>New Challenges</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />In fact, hard economic times have returned. You may have felt the sting as family members and have lost their jobs. You may also be aware that tuition is rising rapidly at other universities, making college hard to afford. By heeding President Eyring's challenge to sacrifice and innovate rather than seeking a proportional increase in funding from the Church, we have been able to grow the university while keeping its cost relatively low and its quality high.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the past ten years the world has also become harder spiritually. Darkness is growing, which means that more good people are seeking to find the light. Because BYU-Idaho is a beacon of spiritual light, we have added responsibilities as its stewards.&nbsp; Our stewardship requires us to think constantly about how our personal actions affect others, and to change when necessary. Some people might say that we worry too much about small things. But we recognize that we are being watched by those who know that we represent the Savior and this university. We also realize that what we do here affects those who are not presently with us on this campus.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is for our spiritual brothers and sisters, as well as for the Savior and for ourselves as His stewards, that we steadily attend to seemingly small things such as modesty in dress and kindness to roommates. We know that lives, including our own, can be changed simply by what we wear and what we say. I am reminded of that truth each time I perform a temple recommend interview. Everyone who meets with me has already declared their worthiness to enter the temple. Yet I can tell a difference in BYU-Idaho student who literally embodies the principles of the Gospel, as well as the standards of the Code of Honor and Student Living. That student is not only a worthy Church member but a worthy steward.&nbsp;<br /><br />As stewards of BYU-Idaho we also make sacrifices for those we cannot see but who are nonetheless depending upon us. They include the students who may be able to come to this campus because of our willingness to make room. We do that by creating and filling a spring semester and by planning carefully to make graduation possible in just eight semesters. Our unseen spiritual brothers and sisters also include our yet-to-be-born children and grandchildren, whom we bless as we earn not just passing grades, but grades that reflect our very best effort.&nbsp;<br /><br />To others, these academic efforts may seem merely temporal. But we know that all aspects of our stewardship are spiritual. We have sensed that when an idea taught in a class about science or poetry or business illuminated our minds and even touched our hearts. When we honor our academic stewardship, all learning is a spiritual experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />Each of us is tempted in our role as stewards. The temptation with which we wrestle may include a combination of two things. One is self-deprecation, the tendency to think that our current stewardship is not very important. The other, ironically, is self-gratification, the tendency to feel that our temporal desires are too important to sacrifice. You can see how these tendencies might become reinforcing. We may be tempted to say, "Why should I make personal sacrifices for such a small stewardship?"&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>An Example of Stewardship</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />When I face this temptation, I have a personal hero to look to. He is my younger brother Stuart. Like my given name, Stuart's name is a powerful reminder of the principle of stewardship. The Stuart family ruled England during the 1600s; the first of these Stuart Kings, James I, commissioned the translation of the Bible that we use. But before the Stuarts were kings, they served as the High Stewards of Scotland.&nbsp; They took their family name from the service they rendered for generations as stewards to the kings of Scotland. When my mother named Stuart, she was careful to use the spelling (with a "u") that was preferred by the royal Stuarts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Stuart was born just 16 months after I was, and so we have always been close. When I went off to kindergarten he would wait for me in the afternoons at the school bus stop. We played on the same little league baseball team in Rexburg and together farmed the hills west of town. When I left for my mission to Japan, Stuart protected my interests in a girl named Kelly by cleverly serving as her high school locker partner.&nbsp;<br /><br />Stuart was also called to preach the Gospel in Japan. My mission ended as his began, and we were able to meet in his mission home for a few minutes. Stuart became a better missionary than I was, in part because he had read the grumpy journal entries I sent home each week and decided that he would be happy even in difficult, ordinary circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When Stuart returned home he became a Japanese language trainer in the Missionary Training Center. He enjoyed the experience, but worried that it was interfering with his challenging BYU coursework. One day he called our father to say that he planned to quit his MTC job. President Eyring was then Bishop Eyring of the Presiding Bishopric. He had an uneasy feeling about Stuart's decision, but he had to hurry to a bishopric meeting. In that meeting, he saw in his mind's eye Stuart meeting his wife in a hallway at the MTC. After the meeting, he called Stuart to advise keeping the job. Stuart followed that counsel.&nbsp; Two months later, he met another Japanese language trainer, Carol Anderson. They were soon married.&nbsp;<br /><br />When Stuart graduated from BYU, he and Carol and their two daughters moved first to Ohio for a job and then to Pennsylvania for graduate school. From there they moved to Michigan, Japan, Venezuela, and back to Michigan. Along the way, Carol bore seven more children and successfully battled cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />After 11 rewarding years with his employer in Michigan, Stuart began to look for a new job. Using the Internet, he found three possibilities. To his surprise, one was in Utah, close to where our parents live. When he looked for a house that was both large enough for his family and immediately available for occupancy, he found one in our parents' ward.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Stuart and his family moved back into that ward, in which he and I lived as high school students, shortly before President Eyring was called into the First Presidency. As our parents have borne the duties of this calling, along with challenges of health, Stuart and his family have been their stewards. Every night our parents have a standing dinner invitation at Stuart and Carol's home. Stuart and his children care for the house and yard.&nbsp; Carol is our mother's visiting teaching companion.&nbsp;<br /><br />Stuart could work anywhere in the world, and he could fill any Church calling. Yet he fulfills his current stewardship with focused fidelity and no thought of recognition. Stuart is my Faramir, not because he is a leading character in an epic novel, but because he is a steward of epic proportions who will someday be a king with power beyond anything the royal Stuarts dreamed of. The author of that story is not an imaginative novelist or a selective historian looking back on a few privileged lives. It is our Heavenly Father, and He is writing an intricate, miracle-laden life's story for each of us as though we were His sole creation.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>A Promise Reiterated</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />In "A Steady Upward Course," President Eyring said something that is true of Stuart and each of us.&nbsp; He said this:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...I am eyewitness that God is speaking to you. He really is. He knows who you are-each of you distinct, each of you with some possibilities of great contribution and a good life-and He is trying always to tell you who you are."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>President Eyring ended his talk with a promise that likewise applies to all of us. It is both a promise and a statement of guidance for us as stewards of the Church and of BYU-Idaho. He said:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Our hearts, fixed on Him and His work, will keep us on course, however the wind blows. We will follow His prophet. We will see the greatest work of our lives as nurturing others as the Savior did. We will see the potential in others as He sees it. We will treat every resource that comes into our hands as a trust from Him. We will see our victories as a gift from Him and so be protected against pride. We will not fear because we will know we are on His errand."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>With President Eyring's approval, I reiterate the blessing that he pronounced here ten years ago. These are his words, which can apply today with equal force if we live worthy of our stewardships.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now, I leave you my blessing...I bless you that every day you are here...if you will ask in prayer to be shown where the hand of God intervened in your life that day, I bless you that you will see that. [Y]ou will see that He is leading and guiding and lifting you, and that He knows you..."</p>
<p>President Eyring continued:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I bless you to know that what I speak now is the truth. There is a loving Heavenly Father. He has been watching us today as He always watches us. He knows you...He has a plan for you, as He has a plan for this institution, of what it might become if [you] can just have revealed, both to the institution and to you, who you really are."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>I pray that we may all live worthy of these promised blessings of stewardship in the Church and at BYU-Idaho. I add my personal witness that our Heavenly Father loves each of us. He also loves this school. I knew felt when I first arrived here 40 years ago. I feel it even more strongly today. I testify that we are the Lord's stewards. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Managing Director of the Temple Department</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have the wonderful blessing in my employment as Managing Director of the Church's Temple Department and as a member of the Temple Department Executive Committee to be associated with the First Presidency as they approve temples to be built throughout the world and direct the ongoing redemptive work performed in temples.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since President Thomas S. Monson became president of the Church on February 3, 2008, I have been blessed to attend temple dedications and rededications with him or his counselors around the world. I can assure you, brothers and sisters, that temple work and construction has not slowed down one bit under President Monson. He has taken up the banner passed to him by President Gordon B. Hinckley and has moved this work forward in a truly remarkable way. I know that the Lord has prepared him his entire life for this time. We are all witnesses and participants to history in the making. I hope you're writing your feelings in your journals about these times.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'd like to recap for you some recent events with temples and temple work around the world. Last month, President Henry B. Eyring, on assignment from President Thomas S. Monson, dedicated the new San Salvador El Salvador Temple. This is the first temple in El Salvador; the temple district is comprised of stakes solely from within El Salvador. It is a beautiful temple, which has already blessed the lives of the Saints in that country. Over 165,000 people attended the open house and nearly 5,000 people requested the missionaries come visit them. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As is customary, the evening before the dedication there was a cultural celebration presented by the youth in the temple district. Those kids were awesome! There was a tremendous sense of righteous power emanating from them. I can tell you that the future of the Church in El Salvador is very secure. President Monson loves these kinds of gatherings, which allow the youth to associate with thousands of young men and women their own age, who share the same values, and to experience something that they will remember all the days of their lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />On Saturday, September 17, 2011, President Eyring, also on assignment from President Monson, broke ground for the Philadelphia Pennsylvania Temple. You may not know this, but President Eyring grew up in Princeton, New Jersey, about an hour away, and was baptized at the first Latter-day Saint meetinghouse built in Philadelphia! This will be a magnificent temple, right in the heart of Philadelphia, adjacent to Logan Square, on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a major thoroughfare of this historic city. Philadelphia's mayor, the Honorable Michael A. Nutter, and other dignitaries joined in. What an incredible blessing it is to have a temple right in the heart of our nation's cradle of liberty.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Monson has assigned President Dieter F. Uchtdorf to dedicate the new Quetzaltenango Guatemala Temple on December 11, 2011. This will be the second temple in Guatemala and is a beautiful monument to the Savior in the western half of the country, which is a large and mostly rural area. Situated at 7,500 feet elevation, it is located on a prominent hill overlooking the city of Quetzaltenango. Many of the patrons attending this temple will be indigenous, speaking several native languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />May I take this opportunity to thank you for your constant and enthusiastic support of the Rexburg Idaho Temple? Years ago, I remember our daughter telling us about waiting in long lines at the Idaho Falls Temple to perform baptisms for the dead. To have a temple right here in Rexburg, crowning the hill above this beautiful campus, is truly a dream come true. President Clair O. Thueson tells us how reverent and patient and faithful you are. Thanks to you, the Rexburg Temple is virtually fully utilized, and in terms of ordinance activity levels, it clearly sets the pace for temples its size.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Talk with your priesthood leaders about receiving your own limited-use recommend if you don't possess one (this goes for those of you who are new members of the Church as well) and attend the temple as often as your circumstances allow. For you returned missionaries, nowhere will you feel the spirit as you did on your mission, like you will in the temple. It will give you the power to go back out into the world to be the salt of the earth.&nbsp;<br /><br />From the 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 20-21, we read: "Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest. And without the ordinances thereof and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh." &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />President Howard W. Hunter taught: "All of our efforts in proclaiming the gospel, perfecting the Saints, and redeeming the dead lead to the holy temple. This is because the temple ordinances are absolutely crucial; we cannot return to God's presence without them. I encourage everyone to worthily attend the temple or to work toward the day when you can enter that holy house to receive your ordinances and covenants. As the prophets have said, the temple is a place of beauty; it is a place of revelation; it is a place of peace. It is the house of the Lord. It is holy unto the Lord. It must be holy and important to us."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the 26th chapter of Alma, we read of the success of the sons of Mosiah reporting to the Church on their mission to the Lamanites. In the beautiful imagery of the harvest, Ammon speaks of the new converts being gathered into the garner to protect them from the "whirlwinds" of the adversary. Typically, we understand those garners to be the institutional organization of the Church, with meetinghouses and priesthood watch care.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But I like to think when I read verse 5 that the temple is the great garner. Individuals and families who receive the saving ordinances of the temple, and are sealed in eternal family units, are much more likely to remain active in the Church, send children on missions, and see their children marry in holy temples because of the protection and power of temple covenants and ordinances. Being worthy of a temple recommend, and actively worshiping in the temple is an important part of the whole armor of God, literally part of the oil in our lanterns in preparation for the glorious second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. The temple provides us with protection against Satan and the whirlwinds of his temptations.&nbsp;<br /><br />The temple has greatly blessed my life and it will greatly bless yours. There's something ennobling and refining about temple work. President Gordon B. Hinckley used to teach that when we participate in the sacred redeeming ordinances of the temple, we always leave the temple as better people. He taught that the temple is a house of forgiveness; that when we go to the temple with a repentant heart, we can receive forgiveness for our sins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Monson taught in April conference that each temple "stands as a beacon to the world, an expression of our testimony that God, our Eternal Father, lives, that He desires to bless us...an expression of our testimony that life beyond the grave is as real and as certain as is our life here on earth."&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>I believe it would be safe to say that the average commute time for most of you to get to the Rexburg Temple is probably in the 5-10<em>&nbsp;</em>minute range! I ask you to think for a moment of those faithful Saints around the world who still have not had the opportunity to receive their own temple ordinances, and for whom it will be highly unlikely that they will have the resources to travel to the nearest temple, which in some cases may be thousands of miles away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Since 1992, there is a fund available to them. It is the General Temple Patron Assistance Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thousands of Saints around the world are blessed by this fund annually. Take, for instance, the Nestor Illunga family, who live in the interior of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Brother Illunga saved money for four years so that he could take his wife, Sombodi, and their seven children to the Johannesburg South Africa Temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This is a huge, life-impacting blessing to saints around the world. Were it not for this fund, these faithful members would have to wait many years to be able to save up for such an expensive trip. Over the past two years, the fund has assisted over 8,000 people! It is supported fully by outside donations and not by general Church funds. A sister from India, after receiving her ordinances in the Hong Kong China Temple, said, "I always thought that only people with lots of money were able to attend the temple."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You may not be aware, but donations to the fund are welcome. To contribute, you can simply write on your donation slip, under the category "Other," "Temple Patron Assistance Fund," or go online to www.ldsphilanthropies.org and donate to the "Temple Patrons' Fund." President Monson also shared in the April 2011 General Conference, the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Why are so many willing to give so much in order to receive the blessings of the temple? Those who understand the eternal blessings which come from the temple know that no sacrifice is too great, no price too heavy, no struggle too difficult in order to receive those blessings. There are never too many miles to travel, too many obstacles to overcome, or too much discomfort to endure. They understand that the saving ordinances received in the temple, that permit us to someday return to our Heavenly Father in an eternal family relationship, and to be endowed with blessings and power from on high, are worth every sacrifice and every effort."</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now, my young friends...always have the temple in your sights. Do nothing which will keep you from entering its doors and partaking of the sacred and eternal blessings there. I commend those of you who already go to the temple regularly to perform baptisms for the dead, arising in the very early hours of the morning so you can participate in such baptisms before school begins.&nbsp; I can think of no better way to start the day."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, brothers and sisters, what you don't see or hear, by observing President Monson at the General Conference pulpit, is just how energizing his presence is for the Saints wherever he goes throughout the world, especially for the youth. I've been blessed to witness this first-hand. President Monson is a people's prophet. He loves getting out among the people and they love him being there with them. They don't want him to leave and he doesn't want to go either. After the dedicatory services of the Kyiv Ukraine Temple, the Saints did not want him to go. And so he "tarried a bit longer." The similarities to the Savior's ministry are not circumstantial, but more of that later.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify, from my own experience, that the Lord has raised up President Thomas S. Monson for this very day. President Monson loves the temple and feels the urgency of this work, and he is moving this work along at an incredible pace to all corners of the globe! Since he became President of the Church, President Monson has announced 23 new temples and rededicated three existing temples. That's a rate of one new temple every other month! Pretty amazing growth, isn't it?&nbsp;<br /><br />The Buenos Aires Argentina and Boise Idaho Temples, both built in the early 1980s were well-worn, tired, and in need of significant mechanical and infrastructure improvements. The Buenos Aires Temple will have a completely new baptistery addition, new temple missionary housing building, and renovated patron housing facility.&nbsp;<br /><br />You may not be aware, but the Ogden Utah Temple renovation project is the largest of its kind ever in the history of the Church. The entire exterior "skin" of the temple has been peeled off down to the steel beams and concrete footings and a new temple is being built on top of that superstructure. The renovation of the Ogden Temple block will be a significant contributor to the revitalization and beautification of downtown Ogden.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the 124th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we read the Lord's injunction to the Prophet Joseph Smith, in verse 26: "Come ye, with all your gold, and your silver, and your precious stones, and with all your antiquities; and with all who have knowledge of antiquities . . . and bring the box-tree, and the fir-tree, and the pine-tree, together with all the precious trees of the earth."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Temples are monuments to the Lord and to Heavenly Father. They are built at a higher standard than meetinghouses. Even in ancient times, we read in 2 Nephi 5:16, shortly after the prophet Nephi escaped with his family into the wilderness, "And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so many precious things; for they were not to be found upon the land, wherefore it could not be built like unto Solomon's temple.&nbsp; But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the&nbsp;<em>workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine</em>" (emphasis added). &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>In 2010, President Monson dedicated four temples and rededicated one. In April of this year he rededicated the refurbished Atlanta Georgia Temple. I'd like to now take you on a brief trip with President Monson as he has traveled the length and breadth of the world to dedicate these houses of the Lord over the past year or so.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If you're around President Monson for very long, you will notice a couple of his attributes that perhaps are not so visible when he is seen at General Conference. First of all, he has incredible stamina. His energy is boundless. He just turned 84, but has the vitality of a 60-year old! We're scrambling to try and keep up with him. He's wearing us out! Next, he loves to be out among the people. His desire to be among the Saints far outweighs his interest in the architectural details of the temple, however beautiful they may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As you know, President Monson absolutely loves Canada. He considers himself part Canadian. The Canadian Saints consider him to be their own, too. This was very evident in May 2010, when he traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia to dedicate the temple there. The night before the dedication, a youth cultural celebration was held in a local ice hockey arena. This gathering began as a regular Church meeting with song and prayer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Instead of singing the hymn on the program, President Monson directed that the congregation sing the national anthem, "O, Canada!"<em>&nbsp;</em>The crowd, including some 2,000 youth, erupted into cheers! As he got up to speak, President Monson gently touched the lapel pin on his suit coat and the Canadian Maple Leaf flag began to flash red and white! The arena went wild! The youth had made two huge cards for him with their greetings. When he held one of them up to show his appreciation, once again total pandemonium from the youth!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Three weeks later, in the town of Central, Arizona, situated between Pima and Thatcher, in Spencer W. Kimball country, President Monson dedicated a new temple, The Gila Valley Arizona Temple. You've probably seen the YouTube segment of him stopping on the desert highway to greet a group of members standing by the road with "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet" signs held high in the air. He got out of the car and chatted with the members along the roadside in 90+ degree weather, seemingly unconcerned about the pressing demands on his weekend schedule! That evening during the cultural celebration, held at the outdoor stadium grounds of the College of Eastern Arizona, he marveled at the beautiful program of dancing and song.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If you haven't read, or are reading,&nbsp;<em>To the Rescue-A Biography of Thomas S. Monson</em>, I highly encourage you to get a hold of a copy and start coming to know the Lord's prophet. President Monson reaches out to the unheralded, the downtrodden, the depressed, the physically disabled, the aged and the lonely. His sensitivity radar is always on high alert for anyone who would not normally be singled out.&nbsp;<br /><br />He loved the evening. A highlight of the pageantry was the segment on President Spencer W. Kimball. President Monson noted that the concept of the "smaller temple" was enthusiastically promoted by President Kimball. There was a strong spiritual connection that night with President Spencer W. Kimball. The next day, after the three dedicatory sessions, as he was leaving the temple, President Monson asked his security team, "Which way do we go?" As soon as they pointed the way to where his car was waiting in the parking lot, he turned around and headed in the completely opposite direction to go greet the throngs lined up behind the roped-off areas, waiting to catch a glimpse, or perhaps even shake the hand of the Lord's prophet! Thirty minutes later he got into the car and was off to the airport. Lives were touched, many tears shed, because the Lord's prophet tarried a bit longer among the people, in no hurry to catch the plane home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Next, the Cebu City Philippines Temple. President Monson was really taken with the Philippine people. Time and again he told them what a beautiful people they are. He got very emotional when he made mention of the Filipino freedom fighters of World War II, who helped our soldiers in the fight to liberate the Philippines, and who, he taught, were waiting for their temple work to be performed by their Latter-day Saint countrymen. Cebu City is the second largest city in the Philippines, and home to the newest temple in that nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The cultural celebration was held in a downtown indoor arena. Cebu's climate ranges somewhere between hot and muggy and extremely warm and humid. The indoor venue had no air conditioning. President Monson had given the visiting General Authorities and official party permission to not wear their suit coats, for which we were most grateful. But incredibly, he and President Eyring kept their coats on! It was over 90 degrees inside the building with over 95 percent humidity. So hot, in fact, that a dozen or so youth among the performers fainted and had to be carried out! Yet, President Monson was as cool as a cucumber, and seemed to be having the time of his life, while the rest of us were in meltdown mode, even without our jackets. Once again, I learned from his example that day that his own comfort is of secondary importance to him, and that what really matters to him is being with the people, reaching out to them and touching their lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Kyiv Ukraine Temple came next. This was a very long trip for President Monson, even on the Huntsman jet; they had to make a couple of layovers to and from Ukraine. President Monson was fascinated with the Ukrainian people, who just a little over 20 years ago, had gained their own independence from the Soviet Union. He marveled at the quality of construction of the Kyiv Ukraine Temple, which is an exceptionally well-built temple considering the very difficult circumstances that surround construction projects there. He went out of his way to complement the temple project manager, Brother Hanno Luschin, of Germany, for the quality of his work. President Monson knew Brother Luschin's father, Imo Luschin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The cultural celebration was held in a grand old Soviet Union-era theatre. The diversity of cultures in the temple district was well represented with not only Ukrainian songs and dances, but also interwoven into the script were musical numbers from youth groups in Belarus, Georgia, Estonia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Romania, and Russia. President Monson's opening remarks prior to the commencement of the program fired up the youth and they danced their hearts out for him. He said that he was very much in favor of these types of activities for the youth and that they would make friends for life among their fellow performers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Next came the Laie Hawaii Temple rededication. President Monson has a tender affinity for Hawaii and its people. He was the last apostle called by President David O. McKay and it did not go unnoticed that President McKay's imprint is still felt in the islands, especially in Laie. This was a historic renovation of the beautiful Laie temple, which had been closed for nearly two years. President Monson paid tribute to the construction team for their successful achievement.&nbsp; President Henry B. Eyring, who accompanied him, noted that they had achieved a balance of "enhancing the original temple without detracting from it," which is something, he indicated, was not easy to do.&nbsp;<br /><br />In his opening remarks the evening of the cultural celebration, President Monson commented again that he was very much in favor of these types of activities, where boys and girls can come together and have some wholesome fun together. "Now," he said, "some may say they don't need these types of activities and they're fine at home. They don't want to be at home with their parents!" he said. "They want to be part of something truly fun and memorable with young people their own age."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The history of the Hawaiian Islands is intertwined with the outbreak of World War II, and President Monson particularly loved the segment depicting the growth of the Church during that era. The Cannon Center exploded into hearty cheers and applause when a young Tom Monson's picture from his Navy career flashed on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The stakes in the temple district had made an effort to involve children and youth who were perhaps physically impaired, but whose spirit brightened the hearts of all those in attendance. The hula dance segment was beautiful, as a young girl in a wheelchair, Briana Garrido, caught the attention of not only the whole arena, but also the president of the Church. As the most important part of hula dancing is done with the hands, this beautiful girl was among the best dancers there that night. Afterward, President Monson singled her out and went over and gave her a kiss, a sweet and tender scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />On April 30, President Monson flew to Atlanta, Georgia, for the rededication of that temple, which had been closed to the public for nearly two years for major renovation. As a young apostle, President Monson attended the original dedication of the Atlanta Temple in 1983. Fast-forwarding 28 years, President Monson was with the Saints again, gathered outside the temple, reaching out to the one. The anticipation of the youth in that temple district to dance and sing their hearts out for the Lord's prophet was electrifying. It was a joyous occasion for all. President Monson thoroughly enjoys being out with the Saints.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />And so the work goes on, brothers and sisters. President Thomas S. Monson has raised the banner of Zion and is bringing it to all the world as he builds temples closer to our Father in Heaven's children. He announced at General Conference that 85 percent of members are now within 200 miles of a temple, and that percentage is increasing! Isaiah's prophecy of the establishment of the mountain of the Lord's house is literally being fulfilled. Temples literally dot the globe.&nbsp;<br /><br />As we emulate President Monson's example of selfless service, as we reach out and touch the lives of those around us, we will become more like our Savior, Jesus Christ. We will draw closer to Him by following the example of President Monson. I can think of no better pattern to follow, which so typifies the life and way of our Savior, Jesus Christ. We can show our gratitude to the Lord for his living prophet by following his counsels, to live worthily and prepare to serve a mission, to worship often in the temple, to reach out, serve, and rescue as he has done all of his life.&nbsp;<br /><br />May the Lord bless us to catch a glimpse of this great and ongoing work and a greater love and appreciation for His prophet, to be active participants &shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;in the growth of His kingdom, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Former Social Work Professor at BYU</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In response to a lawyer's question, "Who is my neighbor?" Christ gave the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:29-37). I'm sure you remember the story of the man who was robbed, stripped of his clothing, beaten, and left half dead by the side of the road to Jericho. Both a priest and a Levite saw the man but ignored his need, passing by on the other side of the road. Finally, a man from Samaria stopped to help. Now, what was the difference between the three men-the priest, the Levite, and the Samaritan? They were all men of good intention and subscribed to a similar moral code. What motivated the Samaritan differently?&nbsp;<br /><br />The priest had a very important responsibility as a mediator between the people and God. He was, by definition, close to God, while the people, because of their sins and infirmities, were distant from God. He may have wished in this case to distance himself from the man, thus not polluting his priestly role. Perhaps the Levite was a temple worker and (using today's circumstances) may have been late for his shift. Maybe he thought he didn't have had time to stop. We don't know the occupation of the Samaritan. We do know, however, that Samaritans were regarded as inferior and were despised by the Jews. Christ emphasized that the response of the Samaritan was motivated by "compassion" (Luke 10:33). Perhaps that compassion came from the Samaritan's own experiences of being ignored and mistreated. He must have known something of what that half-dead man by the side of the road was feeling. We call such regard for another's feelings empathy. I believe empathy was the motivating force behind the Samaritan's charitable actions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Empathy has been a key factor in my own emotional and spiritual growth, as well as my professional success as a social worker and psychotherapist. Within the context of empathy, my profession has made me a better Christian, and my spiritual values have made me a better professional. Today I would like to share a little about my understanding of the importance of empathy and discuss four ways in which we can enhance our ability to feel and convey empathy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As an introduction to my topic, I would like to share a childhood memory. I was sitting on a bench with other children waiting for Primary to start. (I must have been about four or five years of age.) Admiring the brand new shoes I was wearing for the fist time that day, I was not bashful about sharing my pleasure with the other children. A friend, Helene Jones (I still remember her name) could only take so much bragging, until she responded, "We don't like new shoes. We like our old shoes!" What a shock that was for me. How could anyone not like new shoes? Then it occurred to me that my new shoes looked different through Helene's eyes than they did through mine-a lesson in empathy. I was forced to borrow Helene's lenses and ask myself how I would feel if she were bragging about her new shoes to me.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the book,&nbsp;<em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, Harper Lee elaborated on the need for borrowing another person's lens. In this story, an inexperienced teacher punishes Jean Louise (Scout) unfairly on the first day of school. That evening Scout's father, Atticus, explains empathy to her: "If you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Empathy is enhanced by borrowing different lenses through which to view circumstances or events-seeing things from different perspectives. As a visual aid, I brought along a map of the world. Can you find the United States? There is something familiar about the map, but it doesn't look quite right, does it? Australia is not supposed to be at the top. Let's turn the map around. Does that look more familiar? When my Australian friends first introduced me to an upside-down map of the world, it was an interesting realization for me that the directions, north and south, up and down on the map, were simply arbitrary decisions made by someone many centuries ago. Maps or pictures look different depending upon your orientation-your perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, going back to the story of the Good Samaritan. I'm wondering how that picture of the man by the side of the road looked different to the Samaritan than to the priest and the Levite. The priest and the Levite were probably focused on something else-they hardly noticed the man. But the Samaritan viewed that scene through lenses colored or cleansed by his own painful, learning experiences. He saw the pain and was compelled to act.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Because of our unique set of personal experiences, we have been conditioned to look at people from different perspectives. We could all be looking at the same picture and see very different things. Some of us would see the background; others would see the clothing the person is wearing; and some would notice the facial expression and imagine what the person is thinking or feeling. I am reminded of God's admonition to Samuel in the Old Testament: ". . . the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).&nbsp;<br /><br />Empathy is looking on the heart-a deep understanding of the feelings of others. Empathy should not be confused with&nbsp;<em>sympathy</em>, which is sharing the same feeling. In professional counseling we don't want too much sympathy because it takes away our objectivity and our ability to be useful. An example of sympathy that is not useful is a husband who has morning sickness along with his pregnant wife. (I have been told it does happen on occasion.) This husband has a perfect understanding of what his wife is experiencing because he shares the feeling-he is sick, too; but he is in no condition to be useful in helping her while she is sick. Social workers must understand and respond to the breadth and depth of all kinds of feelings while remaining objective and able to help.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a social work educator, I tried to be like Atticus Finch. I taught my students that they couldn't help a client unless they had a good understanding of how that client feels. So we worked in class at developing the skill of empathy. We practiced identifying feelings by asking ourselves "If I were in that situation, how would I feel?" Then we practiced conveying that understanding by verbalizing the acknowledgement "You must be feeling . . .(mad, sad, glad, angry, etc)."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There is nothing quite like feeling completely understood by another person. In fact, feeling understood may be more important to a client than getting specific help in resolving a problem or accomplishing a task.&nbsp;<br /><br />In supervising my students' beginning experiences as professional counselors, I found a common theme. Inexperienced counselors generally focused prematurely on identifying and solving the client's problem (failing grades, failing relationships, substance abuse, etc.). These student counselors often came to supervision sessions frustrated-wondering why they couldn't get the client to recognize the problem, accept responsibility, or be motivated to change. As the student and I watched the videotape of the counseling session together, I found myself asking the same question over and over again: "What do you think the client is&nbsp;<em>feeling</em>&nbsp;right now?" As novice counselors become more sensitized to the feelings of their clients and acquire skills in conveying that understanding with empathetic responses, we usually see progress. I find that the clients-even those with the most profound problems-have remarkable ability and motivation to change and to solve their own problems once they really feel understood.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I need to insert a caveat here: There is much more to professional counseling than simply conveying empathy. However, without empathy, you don't get very far.&nbsp;<br /><br />Understanding with depth and sensitivity how another person might feel is not easy. You have to be able to relate to experiences in your own life in order to imagine another person's feelings. For example, I am fascinated by the Lord's directive to the Israelites in Exodus 23:9. He commands: " . . . thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt." The Lord used the principle of empathy in teaching the children of Israel, even when they were not ready for the higher law introduced later by Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Empathy is enhanced by valuing our own life experiences and using them to help us understand the feelings of others. We don't have to have the same life events to feel the same feelings, but we do have to have experiences in our lives that teach us about the range of feelings. Our personal experiences that make us feel afraid, excited, frustrated, or angry become our teachers and give us tools to connect to other people.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a professional counselor, I learned that I could use my own personal experiences to not only feel empathy for my clients but also to provide perspective (different lenses through which to view the world) in order to help my clients see beyond failure, anger, or fear to the possibility of hope and resolution. Let me illustrate by sharing one useful experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />Many years ago, when I was a little thinner and more physically fit, I completed a 30-day wilderness survival course. During the third week of that extraordinarily rigorous experience, we were left in groups of four or five students (without an instructor) and expected to find our way from one point on a topographical map to another point-a distance of 40 or 50 miles through some of Utah's roughest terrain. After two days of trudging through the snow in the tops of the Henry Mountains in Southern Utah and getting lost on several occasions as we made our way down into the valley, my companions and I were extremely grateful on the third day to be able to identify our location on the map with certainty. We arrived at a stream in the middle of a beautiful meadow. All we had to do was follow this river to our rendezvous point. It would be impossible for us to get lost again. We gleefully walked along the riverbank, stopping occasionally to enjoy the scenery. The river was wide, slow, and shallow. When we chose to switch to the other side, it was easy to cross the stream by jumping from rock to rock. There came a time, however, when there was no bank. What started out as a grassy meadow had become something of a canyon. As I kept jumping from rock to rock, I remember thinking, "If only I can keep my boots dry. I hate wet boots!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The stream was still slow, wide, and shallow, and when there wasn't a rock to jump to, it was a relief to find out that I could walk on flat sandstone with the water only a few inches deep. The water still would not get inside my boots. But, after an hour or so of this kind of careful walking, the canyon had become narrower, and there was no place to walk without getting my boots wet-inside and out. We were not interested in turning around and finding another route to the rendezvous point; we had spent too much time and energy getting this far, so we bravely continued with water just above our knees. I remember thinking "If only I can keep my pack dry.&nbsp; It would really be a disaster if all my clothes and my blanket got wet." Fortunately, the water was quite clear, and I was able to see where to walk in order to stay in the shallower parts of the river.&nbsp;<br /><br />After an hour or two of this kind of progress, I noticed that the canyon was becoming disturbingly narrow, and the inevitable happened-there was no shallow spot. We still were determined to press forward rather than backtrack, even though the bottom half of my pack was now drenched. Then, after another hour or so of carefully making my way in chest-high water, I took a step and felt nothing beneath my feet. My thoughts had evolved from "If only I can keep my boots dry," to "if only I can keep my pack dry," to "if only I can stay alive!" I paddled desperately for about 50 feet or so. And, finally, there was a welcome sight-a break in the canyon wall and a sandy bank. We climbed out of the water and examined our packs. Everything was soaked! We made a fire, and as I sat there drying myself, my clothes, and everything in my pack, I felt only gratitude. I was alive and well! I remember reflecting on what a waste of time it had been to worry about getting my boots wet.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, having had that experience and other similar experiences, I can respond to a client with empathy. I can say or think, metaphorically, "I can see that you don't like to get your boots wet," or, "You're worried about getting your pack wet," or, "You must be afraid you are about to drown." I know what it feels like to be afraid you are going to drown. But even though I have empathy for my client's feelings, I won't share my client's anxiety because I also have a vision of that client sitting on the bank by a fire (metaphorically speaking) and feeling only gratitude.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have learned over the years that empathy is important for everyone, not just professional counselors. Empathy is an essential ingredient for all positive interpersonal relationships. If we couldn't at least imagine what it feels like to be in someone else's shoes or skin, we wouldn't be able to connect; we would live our lives in isolation. Empathy is the skill or characteristic that makes it possible for us to love our neighbor as we love ourselves (Matthew 19:19). It is empathy we demonstrate when we bear one another's burdens, mourn with those that mourn, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort-as taught by Alma (Mosiah 18:8-9).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Empathy is enhanced and demonstrated by reaching out to others-focusing on their unique feelings and needs. For example, let's assume that your roommate shares with you the heartbreaking news that he or she received a failing grade in a chemistry exam. You may feel tempted to convey empathy by sharing your own experience of failure. You could say, "I know exactly how you feel. I got a bad grade in physics once." Although you meant well, your roommate may not interpret your sharing as empathy-at least not initially-because you are focusing on your experience rather than the experience and feelings of your roommate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of you may have difficulty feeling empathy for such a roommate because you have always been straight "A" students. You don't know what it feels like to receive a failing grade. I suspect, however, that you know what it feels like to experience personal failure. You could say to your roommate, "Yeah, I feel for you. I remember when I got a B in English lit." Needless to say, that comment will also not be interpreted as empathy. Empathy is more than just reaching out to others; it is reaching out by focusing on others' unique feelings and needs. So, you might convey empathy to this roommate by remembering the feelings you felt when you got that B. Instead of focusing on your experience, you could say something like: "You must feel discouraged." With that simple acknowledgement, you have opened the door to a meaningful conversation. At some point in that conversation you will probably share your personal experience of disappointment or failure, but the focus will be on your roommate's need to feel understood rather than your need to share.&nbsp;<br /><br />I cannot address the subject of reaching out to others without quoting my favorite social worker, King Benjamin, whose directives are consistent with the parable of the Good Samaritan:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">" . . . ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Perhaps thou shalt say:&nbsp; The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just-&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But I say unto you, . . . whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent . . . and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For behold, are we not all beggars?"</p>
<p>By imagining ourselves in the shoes, or skin, of the beggar, we can reach out appropriately-not just to appease our guilt, but to do our part, whatever that part may be. Through empathy we will know exactly what that beggar needs. It might be cash, or it might simply be a smile or a kind word. It might be a bowl of soup in the nearest restaurant. It might be information about needed resources. And, in a few cases, it will involve ignoring the begging in order to not reinforce inappropriate behavior.&nbsp;<br /><br />Christ's mission gave new meaning to the word empathy. The empathy we typically try to practice is consistent with the commandment Christ gave at the beginning of his ministry: "Love thy neighbor as thyself." But at the end of His ministry, after He had provided an example, His new commandment was "Love one another as I have loved you." Christ-like love is much more than understanding the feelings of another person. To love as Christ loves requires a perspective that surpasses our mortal ability; that is, we must share the vision and perspective of Christ.&nbsp; Thus, empathy is enhanced by praying for the understanding of others' feelings that comes only through Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />A number of years ago, I struggled through a difficult marriage and painful divorce. My husband had broken his temple covenants and betrayed me. But he would continue as the father of my children, and I didn't want a miserable, adversarial relationship indefinitely. So I made it a matter of prayer. I said something like this: "Heavenly Father, I know you love all your children; so, I know you love my husband. Help me to feel about him the same way you feel about him."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The result was something of a miracle. The Lord couldn't answer my desperate plea to help my husband change-no amount of faith will take away personal agency. But the Lord could take away my bitterness and help me feel empathy for my husband-not empathy in the sense that I could relate to his feelings completely, but empathy for him as a son of God. I knew that Christ had all the feelings of a tender parent for my husband regardless of his behavior. This empathy has made my life much easier.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Love thy neighbor as thyself" is a commandment, not a suggestion. And Jesus' instruction to "Love one another as I have loved you" is also a commandment. As disciples of Christ, we accept this higher mandate. My take-home message is that we enhance our ability to obey both of these commandments by enhancing our ability to feel and convey empathy. I challenge each of us to increase our empathy by borrowing different lenses for viewing other people, valuing our own life experiences and using them to help us understand the feelings of others, courageously reaching out to others-focusing on their unique feelings and needs, and praying for the understanding of other's feelings that comes only through Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Director of Library Services</p>
<p>Bio not available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters I am so grateful to be here with you today, to look into your beautiful faces and feel your pure and tender spirits. I am grateful for the beautiful, uplifting music inspired to calm our souls and prepare our hearts to be taught by the Spirit. I am here primarily to testify that I know the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is real. It is as real as life itself.<br /><br />The scriptures are truly the word of God recorded by prophets inspired of the Holy Ghost to be written for our day even by direct instruction of the Lord Himself. I know by very sacred experience that Heavenly Father loves and cherishes each of us. He knows each of us personally--who we are, what kind of people we are. He knows our character. He created us spiritually so he knows our spirit and our disposition as well as any parent. There is nothing He desires more than we return to live with him again after our mortal experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />Along with life and each breath we breathe, He has given us the gift of agency, a most precious and costly gift. Having the power of agency He expects us govern our own lives, to choose good or evil, to choose to be obedient or disobedient. And then He waits patiently, hoping and exercising great faith in us that we will not disappoint him and let him down as we pass through this life of great blessings, tribulations, and sorrows.&nbsp;<br /><br />Even as Nephi begins the record of his people in the first chapter and first verse of the Book of Mormon, after recognizing his "goodly parents" he writes of "having seen many afflictions" in the course of his days yet he is quick to acknowledge that he was "highly favored of the Lord" ... and had "great knowledge of the goodness of God" (1 Nephi 1:1). Like Nephi, you too are "highly favored of the Lord." Your very presence here today and at BYU-Idaho is evidence you are highly favored among many who do not have this opportunity. We hope, and I am sure you hope, that while you are here you will learn "great knowledge" especially of the "goodness of God."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was asked to be the Director of Library Services for the university, one of the first things that came to my mind was an experience that one of my beautiful young daughters had as she was leaving the McKay Library. A young man approached her and commented," Wow, you must have a lot of overdue books." She turned to him with a puzzled look and replied, &nbsp;"I don't have any overdue books." The young man responded, "Well, you sure have 'fine' written all over your face." Obviously a superficial "pick up line," the attempt to create a relationship went no further.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes, parts of life are not fine. In the course of your days, like Nephi of old you will most likely experience at least some degree of affliction, sorrow, and pain. You might even find some classes are harder than others and you might even struggle to earn the grade you desire. Today I would like to address the principle of affliction or opposition, and how we might maintain the constant hope and gratitude of Nephi. How we might maintain our faith and hold to the dreams of our youth.&nbsp;<br /><br />We might ask: "Why does the 'fine' sometimes fade and go away? Why is college so much harder than high school? Or perhaps why I do I not feel so 'fine' or perfect or beautiful as others seem to be? Why do I seem to struggle with my studies more than others? Why is the 'fine,' the beauty, the energy of our youth sometimes unexpectedly interrupted? Why do sad and unfortunate things happen to good people?"&nbsp;<br /><br />In a more global sense, there are earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, murders, divorce, casualties caused by political unrest, wars, and accidents that affect the lives and dreams of innocent people every day. Lives are lost, bodies maimed, children left without parents with no explanation or justification.&nbsp;<br /><br />So we ask the age-old question: "Why do sad and bad things happen to innocent and good people?"&nbsp; This question is sometimes followed with an attempt to judge God: "If God is kind and loving and good why would He allow such things to happen?" Some people, unable to reconcile the pain and sorrows of mortality with the love and goodness of God, lose faith, reject God, and fail to embrace his plan for them. We don't want that to happen to you.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is actually an answer to this question as taught by Elder Orson Pratt. He explained that when God created man, specifically Adam and Eve they were not created as mortal beings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It would be contrary to His great goodness to make man mortal, subject to pain, subject to sickness, subject to death. When ... He made these two intelligent beings and placed them upon this creation, He made them after His own likeness and His own image. He did not make them mortal, but He made them immortal, like unto Himself. If He had made them mortal, and subject to pain, there would have been some cause, ... to say that the Lord subjected man, without cause, to afflictions, sorrows, death and mortality. But, He could not do this; it was contrary to the nature of His attributes, contrary to the nature of that infinite goodness which dwells in the bosom of the Father and the Son, to make a being subject to any kind of pain."&nbsp; (Brown, 2003, pp. 62-63)</p>
<p>Lehi understood this doctrine and taught further: "Adam fell the man may be; and men are that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). James E. Talmage wrote, "Adam and Eve could never have been the parents of a mortal posterity had they not themselves become mortal; mortality was an essential element in the divine plan respecting the earth and its appointed inhabitants ..." (Talmage, 2003, pp. 72-73).&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me assure you God is kind, loving, and good. Everything He does is eternal and perfect. While God is perfect, by design and by principle, mortality was never intended to be perfect. Lehi made it clear to us that "there must be opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11). Moroni taught that we will "receive no witness until the trial of our faith" (Ether 12:6). Peter assured us that the trial of our faith is more precious than gold ... though it be tried with fire (1 Peter 1:7).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Perhaps the more responsible and more important questions are: "How can we maintain faith and happiness amidst disappointment, tragedy, loss of health and misfortune?" "How can we 'hold to our dreams' when life or mortality is not what we wished it to be?"<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />On one occasion when President Hinckley addressed this topic, he used a favorite quotation from Jenkin Lloyd Jones: "Anyone who imagines bliss is normal is going to waste a lot time running around shouting that he has been robbed. The fact is that most putts don't drop. Most beef is tough. Most children grow up to be just ordinary people. Most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration. Most jobs are more often dull than otherwise. Life is like an old time rail journey - delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of speed. The trick is to thank the Lord for letting us have the ride" (Hinckley, 1997).&nbsp;<br /><br />Although the very nature of mortality includes trials and tests, it is difficult to deny that our lives are truly blessed with "beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of speed." I believe the Lord hopes we will use our agency to have faith to dream of greater and more frequent, even perhaps eternal vistas rather than to fall into despair because of delays, sidetracks, and the dusty smoke of life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me suggest three things taught by our Savior that we can choose to do to maintain our faith and happiness amidst disappointment, tragedy, loss of health, and misfortune. Three principles that, if remembered and applied, will help us hold fast to our dreams.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>First, learn to Love and dream with someone</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't mean love in the selfish, distorted sense that Hollywood portrays. I mean in the most human yet God-like compassionate and caring manner Christ exemplified. When answering the Pharisees question, " ... which is the greatest commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all they heart and with all they soul, and with all they mind. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (Matthew 22:37-39).&nbsp;<br /><br />Here we are taught to love in three ways: Love God, love ourselves, and love our neighbor. To me that means keep the commandments, take care of ourselves mentally, physically, and spiritually. It also means we should be unselfish and think of the needs and feelings of others around us. In our family we learned to apply this commandment to the neighbors within our own home. Brothers and sisters and even roommates are neighbors to be loved, however difficult that may seem.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me be so bold as to encourage you to work hard to develop significant relationships during this time of your life. Find someone who will dream with you. Talk about your dreams with someone and listen to theirs. Dream of both heaven and earth, dream of relationships you hope to develop, dream of lives you hope to live. Not all these relationships will work out; that's the way it should be in this stage of life.&nbsp;<br /><br />You will find some people have dreams compatible with yours others dream differently. You will learn important things about yourself and others as you learn to understand and to care for one another's most tender hopes and dreams. Goals and dreams and life itself is meant to be shared. The Lord never intended man should live alone. Unshared dreams are little more than selfish, temporal fantasies.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the priesthood session of a recent general conference, President Monson counseled in a very practical sense:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Now, I have thought a lot lately about you young men who are of an age to marry but who have not yet felt to do so. I see lovely young ladies who desire to be married and to raise families, and yet their opportunities are limited because so many young men are postponing marriage. Much has been said concerning this matter by past presidents of the Church. Said President Harold B. Lee, 'We are not doing our duty as holders of the priesthood when we go beyond the marriageable age and withhold ourselves from an honorable marriage to these lovely women.' I realize there are many reasons why you may be hesitating to take that step of getting married. If you are concerned about providing financially for a wife and family, may I assure you that there is no shame in a couple having to scrimp and save. &nbsp;... Perhaps you are having a little too much fun being single..."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me add, perhaps dreams are too limited, perhaps too selfish. President Monson continues:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Brethren, there is a point at which it's time to think seriously about marriage and to seek a companion with whom you want to spend eternity. If you choose wisely and if you are committed to the success of your marriage, there is nothing in this life which will bring you greater happiness" (Monson, 2011).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this, I add my testimony of the great happiness found in a committed marriage. Marriage is the relationship where dreams of eternity are shared and carried out and love can be experienced in its most eternal form. You are now in the season of life to begin dreaming those dreams and making them become reality.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Second, learn to have faith and develop trust that helps you endure all things</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Connie, my wonderful loving wife and mother of our children, is not here with me today. She is home listening to this devotional on the radio as she lies on her couch. She cannot walk. In fact she is unable to sit for more than about an hour a day. Her body is frail and withered, it moves slowly or not at all because it has difficulty responding to the messages sent from her brain, she needs help with the most basic of lives processes. She suffers from the slow, progressively debilitating, and humiliating effects of multiple sclerosis, a disease that randomly attacks and destroys her nervous system.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Once we were young as you are and our hearts were full of dreams and our minds full wonder as we studied and prepared for the future. While attending Ricks College, Connie served as a student body officer and had many wonderful experiences that she shared with me in cherished letters while I served a mission in Finland. Here she is enjoying a devotional luncheon with President Joseph Fielding Smith. One of my dreams was to take her to Finland someday. We did that; in fact, we were able to live there for almost a year. In this picture we are attending an event at the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As a young mother she would share her love of nature with our children walking through the forests and fields naming and explaining the individual characteristics of virtually every wildflower they could find. She loved to cook and I loved her thoughtfully prepared meals. She shared her musical talent with our children as she accompanied their string quartet on many occasions. She even tolerated the emptying of spit valves on her plants as she accompanied our son's Boy Scout brass band practices in our living room.&nbsp;<br /><br />After our children were in school, she graduated from college and taught kindergarten for 13 years. She was always ready for a good hike into the forest to find a hidden waterfall or a secluded lake. She seemed interested in so much of the goodness and beauty in the world around her. Most of all she loved her family and the people in her life. She was a happy, fun, wonderful mother. She was quick to offer service, to provide a delicious meal, or lend a listening ear.&nbsp;<br /><br />She can do none of those physical things now. She is confined to her bed and her couch and has difficulty talking but maintains a positive attitude even as the beauty of her smile fades with disease. We have a firm hope in the resurrection and an eternal relationship. I know when she is freed of this disease she will once again fill our home with music and accompany her daughters who now thoughtfully bring their instruments and play for their mother. I hope she will once again cook me a delicious "Connie meal," run with her children and grandchildren, and enjoy all the goodness that abounds in eternity. I have faith and trust in who she really is.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the beautiful paintings by the Danish artist Carl Bloch, which is displayed in the foyer of this building, depicts Christ at the pool of Bethesda. I watched with tears in my eyes this summer as my struggling son taught the story of this painting to his six children. Tradition held that at certain times one could be healed at the pool if that person were to be the first to enter. On a particular Sabbath day, Jesus visited the pool and saw a man crippled for 38 years who with great faith in this tradition was lying at the edge of the pool hoping to be the first to enter.&nbsp;<br /><br />Knowing how long the man had patiently hoped to enter the pool, Jesus compassionately asked, "Wilt thou be made whole?" The afflicted man replied, "I have no man to put me in the pool; but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me." Jesus said, "Rise, take up thy bed, and walk" (John 5:1-15). Immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I look at this painting and a see a very familiar languishing foot attached to a leg in an unnatural position. I see a familiar weakened reclining posture needing support and protection. I see my wife at the pool of Bethesda with her frail helpless body and constricted hands that can no longer make music, cook food, or move as they once did. I know how desperately she wishes things were different and how patiently she waits to be whole. I also have complete faith and trust that although she can do nothing physically, she does her best and tries her hardest. I know this because that is who she is. My service to her is made easier because I have faith and trust in her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Then I wish as did Alma: "Oh that I were and angel and could have the wish of my heart" (Alma 29:1). But I am not quite so missionary minded at the moment. I only wish I could take the sorrow and disease away from my dear companion. I wish Christ would have her pick up her bed and walk again as he did with the man at Bethesda. I know He can and I know He will; it just may take more than 38 temporal years. But like Alma I recognize I sin in my wish. I am only a man, only a person, but that is what my wife needs: someone to lift her into the pool. There will be someone in your life who also needs to be lifted or blessed by you I hope you will be sensitive to that need.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am learning to be content with things which the Lord has allotted me and to have a firm faith and trust in all He has promised: the resurrection into a perfect body, eternal life and progression. And, I cannot deny his hand in blessing our lives for many, many years with all that we ever dreamed of: a companion to love, knowledge of the gospel, a good education, children, a comfortable home, rich memories of good experiences, good work, and opportunities to serve. For this I am eternally grateful.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Third, do your best, seize the day, create memories and live without regret</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord sacrificed to give us his greatest gift: agency. It is up to us how we use our time, resources and abilities. Each moment we live, each decision we make, each thought we have creates a memory in some way. Hopefully we are creating memories of value that will inspire and lift our souls during times of need or despair. Memory is a powerful eternal tool, so powerful that a veil was placed over memories of our pre-mortal experience causing us to live by faith and trust in the word of the Lord to guide our choices.&nbsp;<br /><br />Perhaps this veil of forgetfulness also serves as a witness that the new cache of memories we store are a direct result of use of agency.&nbsp; In the Book of Mormon, Alma speaks to his to his son Helaman: "...never be weary of good works ... for such shall find rest to their souls" (Alma 37:35). Then Alma teaches his son the great lesson we all have heard: "Oh remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God." In our family we call this being a "try hard person;" someone who works hard to do their best and strives to keep the commandments. This concept is the foundation upon which a lasting, eternal relationship is built, even with our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;<br /><br />As my wife's health continues to deteriorate and her condition requires more assistance, I take heart in the fact that I know she is doing all she can physically and emotionally. She has always done her best and worked her hardest. There is no question in my mind she continues to try her best, when her body will not respond to her signals and desires.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes we wish things were different. Nephi, the son of Helaman, recorded a lament not a lot different from when his grandfather Alma wished to be an angel some 50 years earlier. Nephi, the grandson of Alma exclaimed with the agony of his soul:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Oh, that I could have had my days in the days when my father Nephi first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have joyed with him in the promised land; ... yea if my days could have been those days, then would my soul have had joy ... But behold, I am consigned that these are my days ..." (Helaman 7:7).</p>
<p>Then Nephi went about his work with vigor. Brothers and sisters, these are your days! I invite you to do as Nephi did and accept your discipleship in these your days. Seize these days, do your very best, and make memoires, leaving no time for regret. These days will be filled with happiness and sorrow, joy and disappointment, good grades, and challenging course work. Don't expect anything different, don't expect life to always be easy and don't expect school to always be easy. Have faith in Elder Maxwell's observation: "The Lord has his own unique way of getting good things out of bad situations, again and again. So many positive and prophetic promises are there to help young latter-day disciples to cope" (Maxwell, 2004) ... in these your days.&nbsp;<br /><br />The loss of my wife's health and abilities has played an important role in my personal and spiritual growth. The experience has brought me to my knees in tears and pleading on many occasions because I needed further instruction from a wise Heavenly Father. It has opened my heart to truths I had desired to better understand. I do not yet have all the answers to "Why me?" or "Why her?" I do, however, have an increased understanding of many principles; an understanding that is priceless to me.&nbsp;<br /><br />These, the last days, will certainly be more challenging to you young disciples than simply coping with sharp economic downturns and a rapidly changing world. The scriptures tell us in these, your days, "the love of many shall wax cold" (Matthew 24:12) resulting in a loss of hope and widespread despair. Such symptoms need not characterize you, nor your responses to life. You will experience trials and affliction, but if managed in a framework of faith it need not weigh you down. Elder Maxwell encouraged us to allow the Lord to be our tutor. Enoch rejoiced, and so can you, over the grand peaceful comforting of God. Enoch was discouraged when the Lord showed him the workmanship of His hands and explained he had "given the people a commandment to love one another and that they should choose me, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and they hate their own blood" (Moses 7: 32-33).&nbsp;<br /><br />Enoch saw the resulting wickedness caused by not keeping this simple first commandment. He wept and told the Lord that he would "refuse to be comforted." But "the Lord said unto Enoch: Lift up your heart, and be glad; and look." Then Enoch saw the big picture including these, your days and he rejoiced! Remember, as did Nephi, you are highly favored of the Lord. Do not "refuse to be comforted" in your times of need. I pray that in all your challenges, large or small, you will have faith to allow the Spirit to comfort you and guide you. Let the scriptures refresh you. I pray that your hearts will remain warm with love and not wax cold with wickedness and wrong choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Elder Orson Pratt reminded us that in the resurrection "perfection will swallow up imperfection; the healing power will be done away, for no sickness will be there ... (other gifts of the Spirit will also be done away). But, charity, which is the pure love of God, ... will sit enthroned in the midst of the glorified throng, clothed in all the glory and splendor of its native heaven. If man would win eternal life, he cannot afford to neglect the duty of love to his fellowman, for 'Love is the fulfilling of the law'" (Talmage, 2003, p. 445).&nbsp;<br /><br />I pray that as you dream of your futures and eternal life, you will love one another. Have faith in the divine compliment God has given you by placing you on the earth now, in these your days.&nbsp; Make use of these, your days, and there will ever be more that the Lord will give you to do. I bear witness to these simple and pure principles restored with the gospel in these latter days in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to speak to you today. I cannot be with you in person, so I am very grateful for the technology that allows me to share some thoughts with you from my office at home. I can&rsquo;t be in crowds or meetings during this period of time as I recover from the kidney transplant I received August 2. This operation has been a great blessing. I am recovering well and getting stronger every day. I am grateful for your love and support and for your prayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been ten years since President Eyring delivered a landmark talk at a BYU-Idaho devotional entitled &ldquo;A Steady, Upward Course.&rdquo; That talk contains remarkable prophecies about BYU-Idaho. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This afternoon I would like to reflect for a moment on the last ten years and our experience on the steady, upward course. I want to share with you a pattern I see in our work together. I call the pattern Innovation by Revelation. I will describe the pattern and then comment on seven principles that govern the way the pattern works at BYU-Idaho. I will close with a look forward and offer a few thoughts about what the next ten years will require of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ten Years on The Steady, Upward Course</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>As I have reflected on the last ten years, two words capture what I feel about where we have been and what we have experienced. The two words are Revelation and Innovation. President Eyring anticipated those themes in his remarks. He spoke on September 18, 2001, a week after terrorists attacked the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. It was a time of great uncertainty and economic turmoil. He said:</p>
<p>What I will now describe . . . is the miraculous thing that has happened here&mdash;where the Lord has guided this institution and will guide it in such a way that although there will be tremendous change, the personal deep and spiritual characteristics of the place will not only not be lost, they will be enhanced. . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>. . . And change will not end. The phrase "rethinking education" is not to be only a slogan. . . . &nbsp;The school is to be a place of educational innovation&mdash;permanently. . . .</p>
<p>. . . The people here have treated all they had as the Lord's and always counted it as enough. And they have used it as if it was the offering of the poorest widow to her Lord and to His Kingdom. Nor have they felt badly treated when the Lord asked them to take less and yet give more. Because of that faithful obedience and sacrifice, I certify the Lord has poured out His Spirit here.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>What President Eyring said ten years ago is true of the university today: Innovation is ongoing at BYU-Idaho, and it occurs powerfully and effectively because of you. Because of your faith and obedience, your humility and consecration, the Lord has blessed us with revelation and associated gifts of heavenly power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a pattern in the way that revelation comes and in the way it inspires and enables innovation. I call this pattern Innovation by Revelation. I believe that recognizing and acting in faith to use that pattern will be essential in the years ahead. I first want to talk about the three arenas in which innovation takes place and then discuss seven key principles that govern the pattern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Revelation and the Arenas of Innovation</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>Innovation by Revelation takes place in three different arenas which are closely connected and reinforce one another.</p>
<p>Arena #1:&nbsp; Vision and Strategy&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arena #2:&nbsp; Programs and Initiatives</p>
<p>Arena #3:&nbsp; The Daily Work of Small Groups and Individuals</p>
<p>In each arena revelation and the bestowal of heavenly gifts and power has driven innovation. A scriptural example of the arenas and the way revelation works in them is found in Enoch&rsquo;s call to be a prophet:</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Enoch:&nbsp; Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. &nbsp;Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance, for all flesh is in my hands, and I will do as seemeth me good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; therefore walk with me.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>If we take the promises of the Lord in these passages and match them with the three arenas, we gain insight into the way revelation comes and how it drives innovation:</p>
<p><em>Arena #1&mdash;Vision and Strategy</em>. The Lord calls Enoch and directs him:&nbsp; &ldquo;Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup> The Lord leads the university through His living prophets. Revelation about vision and strategy comes to the Prophet and, thus, to the Board and to leaders in the university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Arena #2&mdash;Programs and Initiatives</em>. The Lord promises specific revelation and guidance and specific help and support in the work: &ldquo;Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup> This kind of revelation provides insight and power that guides and nurtures the development of very specific programs and initiatives. It comes to the Board, to the leaders of the university, colleges, departments, programs, task forces, councils, committees, and to individuals who have responsibility for initiatives. It comes when we are on the move. Revelation comes as we act in faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Arena #3&mdash;The Daily Work of Small Groups and Individuals</em>. The Lord promises His Spirit to (and to justify the words and actions of) His faithful servants: &ldquo;Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy words will I justify.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup> Revelation&mdash;and heavenly power&mdash;blesses the daily work of individuals and small groups of people. It comes to the Lord&rsquo;s faithful servants all across the university. Those who &ldquo;walk with [the Lord&rdquo;]<sup>6</sup> and take action to innovate in their own personal sphere of influence in accord with the Spirit, and with revelations in Arena&rsquo;s 1 and 2, will be justified by the Lord. The Lord will take what they say and what they do and make it powerful and great.</p>
<p>Innovation by Revelation has been the pattern in the innovations we have experienced at BYU-Idaho. Some of the innovations have been significant and have brought substantial change. I have in mind innovations like the Activities program, the track system, the year-round calendar, Foundations, the Learning Model, online learning, Pathway, and the BYU-Idaho Center. But there are literally thousands of other innovations that have occurred all across the campus that also follow this pattern and are critical to the university&rsquo;s progress on the steady, upward course. Here is an example of Innovation by Revelation at the level of work groups and individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last ten years, when the university has grown significantly, the total water usage on campus has not increased at all (this is not water use per person, this is total water use). This has saved the university significant resources and has required only a modest investment. It has occurred through many, many small innovations in the way we manage and use water, all of them driven by people in our Facilities Management group. Many, many small incremental innovations have added up to a significant impact on our operating costs as we have pursued the steady upward course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revelation has been central to this process. (Of course, so has hard work and hard thinking.) The people involved will tell you of the impressions that have come, the problems solved in what seemed a miraculous way. &nbsp;Heaven must care about how we use water because the folks involved have had the powers of heaven in their work<em>.</em><sup>7</sup></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Innovation by Revelation:&nbsp; Principles</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>We have discussed the arenas in which Innovation by Revelation occurs. The arenas are: 1) vision and strategy; 2) programs and initiatives, and 3) the daily work of small groups and individuals. I turn now to a few principles that govern this powerful pattern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Innovation Flywheel:&nbsp; The Power of What Has Gone Before</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our experience illustrates that inspired innovative efforts, closely linked to mission and strategy, create momentum and a store of creative energy. We might call this the <em>innovation flywheel</em>.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take Foundations as an example. From 2000 to 2004 when the university received full accreditation, the faculty created hundreds of new courses and many new majors, all shaped and influenced by innovative concepts&mdash;integrated majors, clusters, internships, and so forth. In addition, Elder Bednar had laid out a vision of BYU-Idaho as a beacon of light in learning and teaching. This was inspired work. Thus, the development of Foundations took place in an organization with momentum around rethinking education and with experience in receiving revelation and innovating in curriculum and pedagogy. There was inspired creative energy ready to be applied. Today that flywheel continues to be charged with revelation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>A key idea is: Seek revelation that will build momentum and charge the flywheel of innovation. </em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Importance of Inspired Counsel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our innovative efforts we have had a wonderful measure of inspired counsel. When our colleagues and coworkers have an impression or a feeling that comes from the Spirit, they speak up and raise questions and issues and provide new perspective as an innovation develops. Inspired counsel often leads to new directions and saves us from mistakes. It is a source of revelatory guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>A key idea is: Listen to one another and always seek the guidance of the Spirit.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Power of Small Groups of Inspired, Committed People</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small groups of people who are committed and empowered&mdash;and who are guided by revelation&mdash;can do amazing things. We have many examples of that true principle. A key role of leaders in any innovation is to seek revelation in picking the right people for the teams, giving them the right direction and guidance, and staying connected to them for ongoing support and help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>A key idea: Base innovation around small teams of the right, empowered, inspired people. </em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discipline is Essential</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired creativity is the engine that makes innovation go. But we also need inspired discipline&mdash;objectives, reviews, plans, processes, and some structure, but not too much. Inspired processes of discipline can become a forum for revelation. The key is in the balance between creativity and discipline, and that balance shifts over time as an innovation begins to take shape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>A key idea: Seek revelation to achieve the right balance between creativity and discipline. </em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Innovation Requires A Lot of Listening and Talking</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Innovation by its very nature involves a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity. Inspired innovation needs a lot of communication&mdash;a lot of listening and a lot of talking. This must be in informal settings as well as formal occasions. As noted above, people who feel impressions from the Spirit need to be empowered to speak. Without that we lose a hugely valuable source of insight and inspiration. Discussions, both formal and informal, are often a mechanism the Lord uses to reveal His will. This is revelation by council (cil) and by counsel (sel).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>A key idea: Whatever level of communication you think is sufficient, double it; and then triple that. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>
<p>The Power of Vision and Strategy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our experience illustrates the power of vision, especially prophetic vision and a well-conceived strategy. Clarity of vision and strategy cuts through a lot of the ambiguity and sharpens the focus of the innovative work. Vision and strategy, therefore, cannot be vague and ethereal. They must be clear and concrete, but framed broadly enough to allow for creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>A key idea: Vision and strategy should guide and empower, not handcuff. </em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Importance of Humility</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Innovation by Revelation charges the flywheel, but it can be slowed and ultimately stopped by pride. The innovation-dampening power of pride is manifested not only in the Book of Mormon, but in all types of modern organizations. Our mortal tendency is to respond to success with self-satisfaction and complacency; the heavens close to us, and the inspiration required to innovate is cut off. The antidote to this natural tendency is humility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The would-be innovator can apply the power of humility by asking a question posed in prayer by Elder Richard G. Scott after he received inspiration about how to be a more effective servant of the Lord.&nbsp; He asked, &ldquo;Is there more I should know?&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oliver Cowdery&rsquo;s experience in attempting to translate suggests that this question should be directed not only heavenward but also to expert colleagues who can help us &ldquo;study out&rdquo; our innovative ideas.&nbsp; The counsel and correction they offer is often invaluable as we return to ask in prayer, &ldquo;Is there more I should know?&rdquo;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp; When there is more, God blesses us with revelation and we give thanks to God for His mercy and grace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As this cycle of humility is repeated, revelation come and the innovation flywheel gains additional momentum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>A key idea: Beware of pride; seek the Lord&rsquo;s guidance and power in humility and faith.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Innovation by Revelation is a pattern of great power. It will be critical to our work as we pursue the steady, upward course in the decade ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>We are on a remarkable journey at BYU-Idaho. We have come a long way since 2001. Because of your faith and your diligence and your obedience, the Lord has lifted us upward to a higher level of performance in all our work. But I am convinced the Lord is reaching out to us to lift us to even higher ground. He has prepared the way for us to become much more effective in everything we do. I have no doubt that we will. Listen to the words of President Gordon B. Hinckley at the dedication of the Hinckley Building in October 2002:</p>
<p>I see a great future for this institution. &nbsp;It will go forward under inspired leadership.&nbsp; It will grow in strength under a dedicated and able faculty. &nbsp;It will be increasingly recognized as its graduates move out across the world and fill positions of responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I know this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this because this is an institution of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Church will never fail. &nbsp;Jesus Christ stands at its head. &nbsp;And just as it will never fail, neither will its institutions and programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This university will succeed in a wonderful manner. &nbsp;It will take its place among the great learning facilities of our nation as we who have some attachment to it walk and work in faith. &nbsp;That I believe with all my heart and pray that that day will come, as it surely will.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>We are in for a tremendous decade ahead. It will be a season of Innovation by Revelation as the Lord and Savior reaches out to lift us higher, preparing His kingdom and us and the rising generation for His return and His millennial reign. We must become more powerful in our influence on our students while we serve more of them at lower relative cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this season ahead&mdash;when the university will grow in students, in reach, and in new modes of education&mdash;raising substantially the quality of what we do must be paramount. It must be quality of our kind. It must be rooted in eternal truths and grounded in deep learning as we help our students become disciples of Christ and leaders in their families, in the kingdom, and in their work. We must help our students Know, and Do, and Become<sup>12</sup> what God wants them to Know, and Do, and Become.<sup>13</sup> Quality of our kind must be infused with the Spirit of Ricks so that even as we serve more of them, each student will feel the power of the Holy Ghost in their daily lives. Each will feel loved and nurtured by God and by you, His servants; and each student will be imbued with a spirit of responsibility, obedience, humility, sacrifice, service, and deep and abiding faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quality of this kind will only come through revelation applied and implemented. It will come through Innovation by Revelation. I have no doubt that the revelation will come. The Holy Ghost will minister here in our work; and the Lord will watch over us, guide us, and lift us beyond our own talents and capacities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have been prepared for this time and this place. You have been prepared to receive these great blessings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ten years ago President Eyring saw it; Elder Bednar saw it; and President Hinckley saw it. Today I reaffirm it: this university will be a beacon on a hill, a light in a dark world&mdash;a bright light of quality in learning and teaching and in everything we do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will come because you are what Peter called &ldquo;stewards of the manifold grace of God.&rdquo;<sup>14</sup> It will come because you treat everything you have as a sacred trust from God. It will come with hard work and diligent seeking. It will come because of your faith in Jesus Christ, your submission to His will, your humility, your consecration, your willingness to sacrifice, and your devotion to the Lord. It will come because we will be focused on blessing the lives of our students&mdash;and students everywhere&mdash;with our eyes single to the glory of God.&nbsp; It will come because of the grace of the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My beloved brothers and sisters, I leave you with my testimony. There burns in my heart a sure witness that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I am grateful for the Atonement of the Savior. In recent weeks I have felt His love and His Almighty power. I pray that we will rise to the great privileges He has prepared for us. I know that as we move forward in faith in Him, He will bless us with revelation and heavenly power. This is His Church and His university. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Young Women General President</p>
<p>Elaine Dalton was born and raised in Ogden, Utah. She received her bachelor's degree in English from Brigham Young University.<br /><br />Sister Dalton married Stephen E. Dalton in the Salt Lake Temple. They are the parents of five sons and one daughter and the grandparents of 16 grandchildren.</p>
<p>Sister Dalton enjoys running and hiking with her family and dancing with her granddaughters. She loves to read, especially the scriptures, and she loves the Lord. She has a deep admiration for the young women around the world and firmly believes that one virtuous young woman, led by the Spirit, can change the world.</p>
<p>Her favorite scripture and life's motto is found in&nbsp;Proverbs 3:5-6: "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."</p>
<p>Today I am so happy to be here with my husband Steve. He is my best friend. He is amazing. I want you to know that when we got engaged he pinned me with his Future Farmers of America pin. I never wore it because it was the head of a cow! But I have kept it all these years-43 to be exact. When we married, we were both in school at BYU. Steve had recently returned from his mission. We both had part-time jobs and very little money. Neither of us had any idea what the future would hold. I recall one sacred evening just before we were married when we shared our patriarchal blessings. Neither of us knew that my blessings would also become Steve's and that Steve's blessings would in turn become mine. When we married we doubled our blessings! We didn't have it all figured out, but we grew together as we struggled and faced challenges together and went through transitions together. It has been a great journey and I wouldn't trade one minute of it.</p>
<p>We often debate this question in our family as we are traveling to run a marathon. What is the best part-running the marathon and crossing the finish line or preparing to run a marathon? Each of our family members has strong opinions about that, but for me, the preparation is the best part. I love it! I love the discipline it takes to wake up every morning and to put in the time and the miles that will help my body respond to the stresses of an actual marathon. It takes desire, planning, discipline and action. It's like life in so many respects-making a plan, strict training, hills, a set path, beautiful vistas, training partners, long lonely miles, people cheering, falling and getting back up, injuries, aid stations, and of course a finish line. A marathon is one thing that you cannot do virtually! You must act and be in the arena.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of my top 10 favorite quotes was given by former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. This quote has motivated and inspired me many times as I have wondered if what I am doing is worth it. President Roosevelt said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>So today, I say to each of you-move out of your comfort zones.&nbsp;<em>Dare great things!&nbsp;</em>These are your days. This is the time that has been anticipated throughout eternity. You have been reserved to be here on the earth now. You were prepared and uniquely tutored for your destiny now. You are not ordinary. Your gifts and talents, and your preparation now will help you to accomplish your divine mission-and each of us has one. Each of you came to the earth with gifts to help you accomplish your part. Again, your patriarchal blessing contains guidance to help you remember who you are and the grand work in which you will play a unique and important part. It also enumerates some of your gifts.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;And we know from scripture that each of us has come with at least&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;gift. So find out what that is and multiply your gifts. You can do that! We again are instructed in scripture to "seek" and even "covet earnestly the best gifts"<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;so that we can assist in building the kingdom here on the earth. Again, you are not ordinary and these are your days!&nbsp;<br /><br />Yours are to be glorious days! They will not be easy. There will be trials and tribulations in abundance but the Lord has said, "And the saints also shall hardly escape; nevertheless, I, the Lord, am with them."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Your lives of preparation, righteousness, courage and purity will change the world! Your influence will be felt in the future, but also right now, in the present. You are influencing the older generation right now.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recently, I was with four women from Idaho. They expressed their gratitude for the righteous young women whose influence strengthens their testimonies. They wept when they told me how much they are learning from watching you. You see, we are not immune to influence from you. You inspire us! Your light gives us hope and confidence in the future. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said it best, "We not only regard you as the seedbearers of a celestial culture to come, but our own journey can be hastened by your pressing forward."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />You will recall from your reading of the Book of Mormon that an emerging generation of youth "became for themselves" and discounted the teachings and examples of their righteous parents. Many "were led away." And then the scripture relates and emphasizes our need for each other and for the strength we receive from each other. It says, "the Lamanites...began to decrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising generation."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Elder Maxwell observed, "Lowering standards in the rising generations can create an undertow that affects all ages."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;So I repeat, dare great things!&nbsp;<br /><br />What do I mean and what will this require of each of you-of each of us? It will require that we: 1) dream big, 2) move out of our comfort zones, and 3) go forward with full confidence relying on the strength of the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />First, dream big-What seems impossible is often possible! Believe in yourselves. Believe in not only who and what you are now, but in what you have the power to become. You are gathered here in this university and this valley sheltered from the world. Sitting on a hill is the temple. This is not by chance. Elder Bednar has referred to a university adjacent to a temple as a "Disciple Preparation Center." He said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Let me suggest that in Rexburg, Idaho, we are in the process of creating not a missionary training center (MTC), but a Disciple Preparation Center-a DPC. In this special and sacred and set apart place, you and I have access to unparalleled spiritual resources that can assist us in developing and deepening our devotion as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the primary and most important reason for the existence of Brigham Young University-Idaho and for its sponsorship by and affiliation with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>So take every opportunity you can to draw strength and inspiration by attending the temple and seek learning not only by study, but also by faith. Work hard to achieve your dreams. Don't let discouragement or mistakes delay you. Move outside your comfort zones. Push yourselves. Expect more. You can move beyond the limitations set by ordinary men. Don't let the low standards and expectations of the world and others cause you to aim beneath your nobility and ability-dream big!&nbsp;<br /><br />Every year in Australia, an endurance race that goes from Sydney to Melbourne is held. This race is 543.7 miles long and takes world class athletes five full days to complete. It is known as the world's most grueling ultra-marathon. And the athletes who enter are mostly young, less than 30 years of age, highly trained and sponsored by large companies.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me share with you the story of a very unlikely competitor named Cliff Young, who at 61 years of age showed up at the start of this race wearing his overalls and work boots. Everyone assumed he was a spectator, but when he picked up his number and joined the other competitors, everyone was shocked. When he was interviewed by the press, they told him in effect that he was crazy to attempt this and that he should not even start the race. They told him there was no way he could ever finish. To which Cliff replied: "Yes I can. See, I grew up on a farm where we couldn't afford horses or tractors, and the whole time I was growing up, whenever the storms would roll in, I'd have to go out and round up the sheep. We had 2,000 sheep on 2,000 acres. Sometimes I would have to run those sheep for two or three days. It took a long time, but I'd always catch them. I believe I can run this race."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The professionals who had run this race knew what it took and they had calculated that in order to finish in five days, a person had to run for 18 hours straight and then sleep for six hours. Everyone knew this fact. Everyone that is, except for Cliff Young!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When the race started, Cliff was left in the dust. He wasn't flashy, he wasn't sponsored, and he wasn't fast. In fact he didn't even run properly-he shuffled! So on the second day of the race, Cliff was forgotten. But to everyone's surprise, he was still in the race. He had jogged all night long! And not only that, but he had determined to run for the next five days straight to the finish line without sleeping at all. No one believed that this could be done-no one that is, except Cliff.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Cliff kept running. Each night he came a little closer to the leading pack. By the final night, he had surpassed all of the young, world-class athletes. He was the first competitor to cross the finish line and he set a new course record...Today, the 'Young-shuffle' has been adopted by ultra-marathon runners because it is considered more energy-efficient. At least three champions of the Sydney to Melbourne race have used the shuffle to win the race. Furthermore, during the Sydney to Melbourne race now, modern competitors do not sleep. Winning the race requires runners to go all night as well as all day, just like Cliff Young."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />What does this story teach us? It isn't that we shouldn't sleep; rather, it teaches us that we can change the world! We can do hard things. We can endure. We must prepare and all our life is preparation. Believe in yourself! Don't give up. Endure! You have the power to achieve anything you set your mind to. There are many lessons and each is custom fit to you. What I know and have learned is that anything worth doing is not easy and that we can do anything that is not easy if we believe. Now you may not be contemplating a marathon or an ultra-marathon, but you may be in the middle of a challenge that looks like one. You may feel opposed on every side. You may wonder if you really can continue to push forward with a perfect brightness of hope. So as Paul taught the Hebrews, today I repeat the same words to each of you-"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Go forward with faith knowing if you do your part, the Lord will always do His.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second, we must be willing to move out of our comfort zones. We must be willing to change, to make transitions, to repent. It is an interesting thing that as human beings, we seek comfort zones. But, from everything I read in the scriptures, I don't think the Lord likes us to be in a comfort zone. He repeatedly takes his choicest servants out of their comfort zones and challenges them by their circumstances, their trials, and their opportunities to become more and to do more. Has anyone gotten into a comfort zone yet in these beginning weeks at BYU-Idaho? Perhaps not, but today I believe one of the reasons I was asked to speak is because I think I have the hanging out/dating thing figured out! Now, what I am about to say may take some of you out of a comfort zone. You see, I have been studying this issue for a lot of years. My husband was the bishop of a singles ward and I studied it there. I have been all over the world and talked to thousands of young women and they have expressed their dismay and discouragement about the whole thing. I am the mother of five sons. So I know both angles. I know the ins and the outs of dating and while I didn't do much hanging out because my mother wouldn't let me, I did enough to understand what takes place in that arena.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now for my discovery about dating-nothing has changed really. And it's precisely because you haven't changed. You see the principle is that the structure is perfectly designed to get the results it gets. Let me illustrate this principle. Take this potato peeler-which you have to be familiar with here in Rexburg! See how it works. It is perfectly designed to get these results! Even this little point is designed perfectly to remove the eyes of the potatoes and look at these results. So in order to get results or dates here on this campus or any campus or anywhere there are young single adults, you have to redesign the structure for the intended results. And of course that means you must determine, and I mean seriously determine just what results you really want-really! So instead of talking to you about marriage and family, I am going to start on a more elementary level. Let's just focus on getting dates. Dates for the purpose, of course, of finding an eternal companion, but let's do first things first! Because you certainly can't marry, and become parents of a beautiful family, unless you actually go on a date (probably a lot of dates). So let's start there. I am going to suggest a structure change.&nbsp;<br /><br />Young women-stop hanging out. Stop competing with each other in a group for the attention of the available men in the room. Make yourself scarce. The boys won't notice for a while and they'll keep hanging out and then all of a sudden they'll say-"Hey where are the girls?" Then they will huddle and brainstorm about whom to text to come and join them. When the text comes, don't go join them-just text back: "Busy tonight."&nbsp;<br /><br />Then wait till they call you and personally ask you to go on a date with them. Not to hang out or congregate with a lot of others, just the two of you and perhaps one other couple-on a date. According to Elder Dallin H. Oaks, this is what this means, "Hanging out consists of numbers of young men and young women joining together in some group activity. It is very different from dating...Dating is pairing off to experience the kind of one-on-one association and temporary commitment that can lead to marriage in some rare and treasured cases."<sup>12</sup>So young men, make an investment with your wallets, in your future. Seriously begin your search for an eternal companion. You are so valiant and good that I know the Lord will enlighten you just like he did the Brother of Jared when he moved him out of his comfort zone on the beach (see Ether 2:14). And, don't look for perfection. Perfection is a journey-my husband is still working on me about that! But instead look for purity. We can't be perfect right now, but we can all be perfectly pure.&nbsp;<br /><br />Many of you have heard me talk about the need for a return to virtue. I truly feel that a return to virtue, meaning chastity and moral purity, would change our society and I also feel that you must be the ones to lead that return. Isn't it rather amazing that in a world that insists on purity in the air and environment, and in our food, that we do not insist on moral purity which lies at the very foundation of every successful and powerful society? By the word return, I am not saying that all have made mistakes and need to return, but I am saying that it is possible to return, to repent to change because of the Savior's Atonement. The Savior himself uses this word a lot when he speaks to us, His sons and daughters. Returning is repentance and repentance is progress. It is a gift that was given to us by the Savior in Gethsemane. It is a gift from a loving Heavenly Father who so loved the world that he sent His only begotten Son. He made it possible for each of us to repent, to return, to change and to become like Him. In order to do this, we must also be willing to move out of our comfort zones-to change. And that change can happen today.&nbsp;<br /><br />Last, we must go forward with full confidence. Did you know that the word confidence is derived from the Latin words "con" and "fideo" which means with faith. Confidence requires faith and purity. That is why Peter admonishes all to "add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;The Lord also instructs us to "let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly" and promised that "then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God.... [and] the Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Several years ago, my husband and I were in Nauvoo. I love going there. I love getting up early in the morning and running those streets in silence and thinking and pondering about what it must have been like to be in Nauvoo at a time when the Church was young. I am always touched as I run down or walk down Parley's Street and read the quotes from some of the pioneers' journals that are now inscribed on plaques and placed along that street. The one that always touches me the most is a journal entry from Bathsheba Smith. She wrote, "[I swept] up the floor, and set the broom in its accustomed place behind the door." In other words, she left that beautiful home knowing that she'd never come back to it again, but she still left it beautiful. And then she wrote, "I gently closed the door and faced an unknown future." So many of those men and women did that. These were cultured, refined men and women gave up everything because they knew the gospel was true.&nbsp;<br /><br />My husband had a lot of relatives that were in Nauvoo at that time. One of them was Zina Huntington who later became one of the general presidents of the Relief Society. She lived in upstate New York when the missionaries visited their home and left one copy of the Book of Mormon for the family to read. As a young woman, Zina held that book in her hands and said, "This is the truth, truth, truth."<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;She was converted to the gospel before she ever opened the book. She knew by the Spirit that the Book of Mormon was a true record and she made the transition from living in a beautiful two-story rock home on a farm in upstate New York, to going with the saints to Kirtland, Missouri, Nauvoo, and later traveling west. She had the confidence to leave her comfort zone, so to speak, because of her faith and testimony. As I go down Parley's Street and read those inscriptions, I weep because I feel the spirit of those men and women. I feel the sacrifices they made for us so we can be where we are now.&nbsp;<br /><br />Zina Huntington married and while living in Nauvoo she was expecting a baby. It was in that condition that she left her home, crossed the Mississippi River, got just a little further West and had the baby on the banks of a river. The river was named Chariton. So the baby was named Chariton. I think about those kinds of things, and then I think about what we've been asked to do. And I think, "Oh, what we're doing is easy compared to them." But you know what? It's not. What we're doing now is pivotal and it's not easy. And it's not going to be easier. In fact, I think it may get harder for us. And I think that we are going to have to be very strong and firm, we're going to have to be like Zina and know-"It's the truth, truth, truth." So as we think about making transitions and moving out of our comfort zones, think about those men and women. How did they do it? What helped them make the transition? I believe it's all about having a testimony of Jesus Christ. And that if you have a testimony of Jesus Christ, and His restored Gospel, you will be able to make any of life's transitions. They had a testimony, and they had a temple. They had covenants - so they had a focus and they knew exactly where they were headed. Nothing else really mattered.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'd like to share with you my testimony that when you make a transition, you are never alone.&nbsp;<em>You are never alone.</em>&nbsp;Our Heavenly Father knows exactly where you are and He will be with you. As you make some transitions, and they're difficult, you can pray to Him. He will even send His angels to be with you. I testify of that. I know that's true, because He has done that for me. I know many of you here know that is true too because He has done that for you. He will "lead [you] by the hand, and give [you] answers to your prayers"<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;as you make wise transitions. You will not do any of it alone as you exercise your faith in Jesus Christ and you pray to Him; He will be with you. As you purify your life you can, in effect, reach out and take His hand, He will lead you to a place better than you can comprehend. As you bravely face transitions you will grow. I have a saying on my message board at home. It reads: "We must be willing to give up the life we have planned in order to have the life that is waiting for us."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We can go forward in the strength of the Lord will full confidence in His promises to us. Perhaps there is a pattern in the words Joseph Smith himself shares with us. He related his concerns on what happened after he had had one of the supreme spiritual experiences of all time. He said,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"During the space of time which intervened between the time I had the vision and the year eighteen hundred and twenty-three-having been forbidden to join any of the religious sects of the day, and being of very tender years, and [being] persecuted by those who ought to have been my friends. . . .I was left to all kinds of temptations; and, mingling with all kinds of society, I frequently fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, led me into divers temptations, offensive in the sight of God."</p>
<p>Then he confessed:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I was guilty of levity, and sometimes associated with jovial company . . . not consistent with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was called of God as I had been."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>He understood his identity! He knew his life was not consistent but most importantly, he knew what to do about it. He had faith that he would receive an answer. He relates: "I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him;&nbsp;<em>for I had full confidence in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously had one.</em>"<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;As you dare to do great things, as you move out of your comfort zones and as you go forward with full confidence and trust in the Lord, your future will unfold before you. You will accomplish many seemingly impossible things and you will change the world!&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to close by sharing with you a memory of some young women in Africa when I last visited there. I asked to visit with some young women prior to training their leaders. The group of young women arrived at the church promptly at nine in the morning. I found out that the young women had gotten up, some of them at four o'clock in the morning, to go to the river and bath and get the water that was necessary for their mothers to do the cooking. And then they walked the distance that it took for them to get to the church by nine o'clock. They were radiant and beautiful when they arrived carrying their scriptures on their heads, in beautiful African dress, bare-footed, and with dust all over their legs. At the end of our time together I asked them to tell me what their typical day was like. They told me every morning they get up, go to the river to bath, and then carry a bucket of water home to the village where they make this mixture called gari which everyone eats either on a leaf or in a coconut. They just eat it with their fingers. The mothers usually make the gari in a pot, over a fire, out in the front of their little hut. After their trip to the river and their simple morning meal, the young women walk to seminary. In the middle of the visit I said, "You have told me what it's like to be a young woman in Africa. Now tell me, do you have many challenges?" They had been very talkative but suddenly the room became silent. They just sat there and so I tried to encourage them by saying, "Now you could tell me, I promise I won't tell the Prophet." They giggled but they still didn't say anything. Finally one young woman, her name was Vivian, stood regally in the back of the room and said in her beautiful British accent: "Sister Dalton, it is true. We young women here in Africa, we have many challenges but Sister Dalton, we have the gospel of Jesus Christ!"&nbsp;<br /><br />That morning in far away Africa, I was tutored by a young African girl who was willing to dare to do great things, dream big, move out of her comfort zone and go forward with full confidence relying on the strength of the Lord. We not only have the gospel of Jesus Christ, we have Jesus Christ. He lives! He loves you. The infinite power of His atonement will strengthen and enable you and He will lead you by the hand.&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify that these are your days. The preparation you are making now in this Disciple Preparation Center will help you accomplish things you never dreamed of. You will witness, and be a part of, miracles in these latter days.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? . . . He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. . . But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have great admiration for those of you who work and study at this university and for the quality of the Church education experience provided here, so it is an honor to be able to address you.<br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>Emerging Adulthood</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />In case you hadn't heard, those of you who are between 18 to 30 years old are participating in a new life stage that has been observed in just the past few decades. Researchers who look at life stages say that instead of moving from adolescence to adulthood those in your age group are experiencing what they call "emerging adulthood." They have noticed that it is taking longer for young adults to complete the steps traditionally associated with adulthood. As you can see on the screen, these benchmark steps include: leaving home, finishing school, getting married, having at least one child, and having a job (or, for women, devoting themselves to homemaking).&nbsp;<br /><br />For example the graph you now see shows the percent of 30-year-olds completing these "benchmarks" as reflected in the 1960 census compared with 30-year-olds in the 2000 census. Note that 65 percent of 30-year-old men and 77 percent of 30-year-old women in 1960 had made the transition to adulthood using these benchmarks as compared with only 30 percent of men and 45 percent of women in 2000. The difference between men and women is largely attributable to the researcher's decision to consider women who are full-time homemakers as having a job.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Scholars have observed that young adults are seeing the increased demand for more education and the increased uncertainty about obtaining and keeping a job and are waiting longer to marry, if they marry at all. Indeed, only 45 percent of those between 21 and 45 years of age were married in the year 2000 compared with 73 percent just 30 years before. In addition, church attendance has declined significantly for those in this age group in the past three decades and the entire decline occurred among those who are not married. Those who are married among this age group are twice as likely to attend church regularly as those who are not married and as a group young single adults have the lowest church participation of any age group across all denominations in the U.S.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Counseling with many young people at BYU, in the mission field, and in my family has given me a sense for the experiences and feelings that are common to this new life stage. Let me give you a few examples:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One young man just returned from his mission and remarked to me how bewildering it seems to choose a career from so many options. His mother wanted him to go into engineering or computer science because she had read that many graduates in these fields were getting jobs but he didn't feel drawn to those fields. On the other hand, when he considered law, business, film-making, teaching English, social work, psychological counseling, and a raft of derivations and combinations of those areas, his head was spinning. How do I even get started? What if I make a bad choice and don't like the field or can't get a job?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A very lovely and bright young woman expressed her exasperation with young men she dates who seem to be commitment-challenged and distracted. She likened it to Doug, the dog in the movie "Up" who was often distracted by squirrels. Do you remember? She explained that she would start dating someone and find that after a date or two he would be attracted to another good-looking young woman and would move on to pursue that "squirrel." Several of the young men who served with us in the Argentina Buenos Aires North Mission have observed that they think some of the young women they have dated have similar "squirrel" distractions!</p>
<p>Many of those with whom I have counseled feel "stuck" in a way similar to those in a video clip some of you may have seen. Two people are riding to a higher floor on an escalator when it suddenly stops. They look around bewildered and began to shout for help. One of them yells at the top of his lungs: "Two people are stuck on an escalator and we need help!" They finally sit down and wait for someone to come.&nbsp;<br /><br />Why don't they start walking? Why don't they see that this is an escalator not an elevator and that they have the power to do something to help themselves? As silly as this seems, I think many emerging adults have similar feelings. For example, young people in the Church get on an escalator of sorts when they enter Primary and Young Men/Young Women. Each year they move to the next class and work together with the help of teachers, advisers, and parents to earn progress awards. However, when they get to college the world opens up and the "escalator" stops moving them along in life. Now they have to make their own decisions and progress. What will I be when I grow up? Whom should I marry? How will I know if I'm making progress in life and in the gospel? These are questions that require individuals to develop their own identity and relationships and there isn't a succession of graduated classes and progress awards to help you decide how you are doing. So many get "stuck" and feel helpless in ways similar to those on the escalator.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you are an emerging adult in similar situations, you may not feel it is particularly helpful to have those of us who have selected a career and found a marriage partner to tell you to hurry up! Our well-intentioned advice could merely add to your stress and your anxiety.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Advice from a prophet-grandfather: Do your best today</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Let me share with you the counsel I received when I was your age that was most helpful to me and what I tried to do with it. Because of who gave me the counsel and its foundation in sound doctrine, I believe it applies to you in your current situation. It came from my grandfather, Harold B. Lee, who was at the time serving as a counselor in the First Presidency of the Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was in my third year at BYU and was struggling with the decision about what to be when I grew up.&nbsp; I was also looking for an eternal companion. I took my patriarchal blessing with me for a visit with grandfather and asked him to read it and then counsel with me about choosing a career. I hoped that somehow the patriarch's inspired blessing would trigger my grandfather to give me a list of career possibilities appropriate for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Grandfather read my patriarchal blessing and then looked up at me and said, "Well, that's a wonderful blessing, Alan. I'm impressed that you worry too much about the future." My heart sank. I was indeed worried about the future and the way we were starting out didn't give me much hope for getting straight answers to my questions.&nbsp;<br /><br />He said, "Let me tell you briefly about my life and then give you the only counsel that I think makes sense given the way life unfolded for me and for others I have observed." He grew up in Clifton, Idaho.&nbsp; It's a little town in southern Idaho. Does anyone here know where Clifton is? It's on the border with Utah near Preston, Idaho, which most of you probably haven't heard of either. He said we always prayed for the "pillars of the Church," by which we meant the Brethren. "I could no more have imagined myself becoming one of them," he said, "than I could think of men landing on the moon, which seemed impossible in those days as well."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"When I came home from a mission," he continued, "farmers in our area, including my father, were really struggling economically and I decided I wanted to learn to do something other than farming to help out. I went to the University of Utah and found that I didn't have enough money to go to school and eat more than one meal a day." So he found some part-time work and then began to work full-time teaching at a local school, enrolling in extension courses and summer school to progress in his studies. When he graduated, his wife thought he could do better outside of education and he got a job selling encyclopedias and other materials throughout the intermountain western U.S. Then the commissioner of streets and public improvements in Salt Lake City died halfway through his two-year term and grandfather was appointed to fill out his term. He then ran for and was elected to his own two-year term.&nbsp;<br /><br />During this same period of time he was called as stake president of the Pioneer Stake. The Great Depression occurred about the same time and of his 7,300 stake members, over 4,800 were either partially or wholly dependent on outside agencies for their livelihood. A majority of the high councilors and bishops in the stake were unemployed. They "dusted off the revelations," as he put it, and tried to take care of the members of the stake by helping them to band together and help each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In 1936 the First Presidency called grandfather to head up the "Church Security" program which soon became the Church Welfare Plan Program. In 1941 he was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve and when I spoke with him in 1971 he was serving in the First Presidency of the Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Alan," he asked me, "do you think I could have planned my career?" He said that if had known what he was headed for he might have been like Jonah and run from these assignments. He went on: "The only counsel that makes sense for me to give is this: Don't live your life worrying about the future. You only have today. You can't do anything about yesterday either except repent or feel good. So here is my counsel about finding a career: Get up each day and recapture your testimony. That is, do the things that bring the spirit into your life: repent, study the scriptures, and pray for guidance. As you feel the enlightenment of the Spirit, consider what you can do that day to follow the impressions you get. Have faith; the Lord will guide you step by step, 'line upon line, here a little and there a little.'"<sup>3</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Application to finding a career</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />As I pondered his counsel and tried to apply it, I began to realize he was telling me I shouldn't just ask in prayer about an ultimate career and expect a final answer but that I should take action each day to explore and observe and try different options so that I had better information about what could make sense for me and so that I learned to be ready for new opportunities as they arose. Essentially I needed to actively study it out in my mind before asking the Lord just as the Lord counseled Oliver Cowdery.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I was also helped around this same period of time by the counsel of one of the Brethren in General Conference. I was seeking answers as I have said by praying for the right career to pursue and I decided to go to conference fasting and praying, hoping that I would learn something and feel something about that decision. Elder Hartman Rector of the Seventy spoke saying he had the impression that some in the audience were wondering about what career to pursue. Wow, thought I, the Lord answers prayers! But then he said: "I'm not sure that the Lord really cares what we choose as a vocation, whether we are a plumber or a librarian--so long as we keep the commandments of God."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The implication of his message for me was: Any worthy profession that you can do well enough to be able to support a family and have time to serve in the Church would be fine. Don't waste your time trying to find the perfect profession. Find a good profession and do the best you can, keeping in perspective what is really important in life.&nbsp;<br /><br />I can just hear my grandfather adding that if the Lord needs you to do something else as you are going after a career that fits these parameters, He can nudge you in a different direction, especially if you are getting up and recapturing your testimony every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the spirit of these observations my advice to our missionaries returning home from their mission in Buenos Aires, Argentina was: consider the kinds of things you do well and enjoy and try to learn what kinds of occupations require those skills. I encouraged them to use the planning skills they developed as missionaries to find an hour or so a week to set up appointments with professors or others in the areas they thought might be of interest and interview them. Ask them questions like: What do you do every day? What do you like and what don't you like? How did you prepare yourself and what would you recommend for me to prepare myself? If you find yourself getting more interested you could ask to tag along to see that person in action where appropriate. You might also ask what summer or part-time work you could do in this area to gain experience and make contacts. Following these leads and the Lord's inspiration will help you get "unstuck" and find the next steps in what is likely to be a series of jobs and even different careers through your life.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Application to finding your eternal companion</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Whether grandfather sensed I was even more interested in finding a companion than finding a career I don't know for sure, but he also spent some time talking about how he decided whom to marry in our visit and offered his counsel to me. He dated and considered other young women while he was working and taking classes. However, he said he was drawn to Fern Tanner because she became such a good friend who was easy to talk to. For example, she was the only one who seemed to be delighted when he suggested that they walk the three or four miles back to her home after a date because he didn't have the few pennies it cost to take the trolley. "What a great idea to walk home and have the time to talk," she would say. "I don't think we would have noticed beautiful moon had we taken the trolley," she might say as they walked and talked. They developed a friendship and enjoyed one another and that friendship ripened into love as they continued seeing one another. He received confirmation about the goodness of the relationship along the way.&nbsp;<br /><br />He counseled me to apply the same principles of doing what I could each day in seeking an eternal companion. What could I do to be a friend, to be involved in wholesome activities of enjoyment and service that would help me to get to know others? Don't look for the perfect companion but for one with whom I can communicate well, one who is committed to righteousness and who will work with me to build a righteous family.&nbsp;<br /><br />I realized as I thought about grandfather's counsel that I was too inclined in searching for a companion to ask for revelation about whether I should marry someone even before I knew her very well. My prayers in both finding a career and a spouse were too theoretical and too focused on finding my true calling in life or my perfect companion. I was hoping to have the lights on my future life's path turned on way down the road to remove all uncertainty rather than doing what Nephi did as he returned for the third time to get the plates of brass from Laban and was "led by the spirit not knowing beforehand the things which I should do."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Nephi was guided along the way while he was in motion and as he opened his heart and mind to the Lord to help him take the next steps. No wonder one of my grandfather's favorite hymns was "Lead, Kindly Light:" "one step enough for me."&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope I don't embarrass myself too much by telling you how I tried to apply this counsel. My approach was to organize what I called my "date a million program." I would try to meet and get to know as many young women as I could. I asked people to line me up with their friends and relatives somewhat like the member referral approach I took as a missionary in Peru and Ecuador. I then created a progressing friends list containing at least six promising "friends" whom I would see more frequently but whom I couldn't see twice in a row so that I didn't prematurely focus on one person and become too romantically involved before I had formed a good friendship. I had around two to four dates a week during this time but most of the dates were to things I already was doing: going to a devotional and then stopping by the Cougareat for a treat, going to a church fireside, attending a lecture or film on campus, etc. I met some wonderful young women and tried to be their friend rather than to court them. I also developed a good list of six progressing friends that I began to spend more time with.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />However, my program almost kept me from following my feelings about Margaret Allred. She was so easy to talk to and such a good friend that I found myself wanting to spend more time with her. But I would then lecture myself that I was supposed to let friendship develop and consider many possibilities rather than narrow my search prematurely. Fortunately, as I got up to recapture my testimony one morning and prayed about my progressing friends list, the Lord helped me to see that Margaret was a wonderful person with whom I could build an eternal relationship. He helped me overlook some of the little flaws I saw when I was comparing my progressing friends. I think I was doing what I see some young men and women I know doing now. They approach selecting a companion as though they were a consumer looking for the best product. The Lord helped me see that Margaret would also have to overlook or work with my flaws, perhaps chief among them that I was a perfectionistic romantic. His love for her and for me and his reassurance that this relationship was worth pursuing was a revelation to me at the time.&nbsp;<br /><br />By the way, at this same time Margaret was following a process very similar to grandfather's counsel. She had been going on dates with a number of different young men but she was clear sooner than I was about feeling that our relationship could be eternal. However, then as now it was harder for young women to initiate dating. Somehow she found out my schedule and I began to be surprised that we just happened to "bump into each other" at many class breaks. She learned that I was majoring in Spanish and decided to take beginning Spanish. She also joined a student government committee that I was also working on. No wonder I came to feel Margaret was such a good friend with whom I could talk so easily!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>How can I tell that I am making progress along the way?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>So how can emerging adults have a sense of meaning and progress as they move through this life stage if you haven't yet found a career or a spouse? Observers of emerging adults suggest that the predominant characteristics of this stage are feelings of uncertainty, tinkering with options, and hesitancy to make long-term commitments. One way my grandfather seemed to address the uncertainty he faced as he moved from one job or career to another was to do his best with each assignment. He wasn't just tinkering but sought to learn all he could and work very hard. It was often his performance in one setting that led others to invite him into another career setting. Living fully in each day, then, was his best preparation for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Packer taught a similar lesson as he experienced his own uncertainties as a young pilot in the Air Force who was assigned for only brief periods to a variety of locations. He realized that he began to assume that he wouldn't be in an assignment for very long so he didn't fully unpack or settle in, didn't try to make friends, and generally felt quite lonely and miserable. He decided that wherever he went he would settle down as if "for the duration." He would make his quarters "homey" by unpacking and organizing his belongings, hanging pictures and decorating somehow. He would get to know others and make friends. It was the difference between misery and happiness for him.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Neither President Lee nor President Packer saw themselves as just "passing through." They invested their attention and best efforts in what they were doing at that time in their lives. We can apply these principles to our membership in the wards and stakes of the Church. Some emerging adults in the Church feel that they need to have a significant Church calling to feel they are needed and useful. I have heard some of them in young single adult wards complain there just aren't enough callings to go around. Others become fairly cynical and give up on young single adult wards as places to serve and progress in the gospel. They dismiss the importance of this opportunity and say the young single adult ward is just "play church" much like "playing school" or "playing hospital" where children pretend to do grown-up things. Everyone is young and seems to be active, they say, and others don't seem to have big problems so why worry and take it too seriously?&nbsp;<br /><br />Yet others substitute having fun for making progress spiritually. They see the young single adult ward as a social scene "meet market" (m-e-e-t or m-e-a-t) where they can look for cute guys or girls and hang out together. They tended to ward-hop and try to avoid significant callings so that they can "shop around."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />None of these perspectives is particularly helpful or appropriate it seems to me. Let me share with you briefly what one of our dear friends taught Margaret and me about a better way to see our opportunities to settle down as if "for the duration" even if we won't be in a particular ward for long and even without a formal calling.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In one ward we attended, we observed a couple, Sandy and Nancy, who seemed to know everyone in the ward and were involved in helping them though neither was involved in a calling in which they would be expect them to do so. When we asked Sandy about this he told us an interesting story. At the end of a year when he served as elders quorum president in a BYU ward, his bishop thanked him for his service and told him that he wanted to give others the opportunity to serve so he was recommending that the stake president release Sandy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Furthermore, he explained, "I'm not going to give you a formal calling, Sandy. But I call you to be a Christian. I call you to notice those who sit alone in church and sit with and get to know them. I call you to walk with those who walk alone and find those who need help and pray for inspiration to see how you or others can help them."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Sandy explained how awkward it felt initially to put himself forward in those ways. However, he related that this was the most meaningful year of Church service he had ever had. He met people he would never have known and found the Lord inspiring him to see needs he had been unaware of as an elders quorum president. He was involved in reactivating several people, doing missionary work as he helped others to change a flat tire, and giving blessings to others in the hospital. His life was full and more meaningful than ever. When they married, he and Nancy had committed they would continue to be Christians thereafter.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, we have all covenanted to be Christians. As President Eyring reminded us in the recent General Conference, Alma taught his people that baptism is a covenant to 1) be charitable (for example, "to bear one another's burdens"); 2) "stand as witnesses of God at all times, in all things, and in all places that ye may be in..."; and 3) to endure to the end in doing these things.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />We don't have to have a "significant" or even a formal calling in the Church to be of service and to live the gospel. Life is so much richer when we learn the great Christian paradox: only those who are willing to lose their lives in the service of the Savior will find themselves.<sup>9</sup>And paradoxically, those who forget themselves in these ways feel more fulfilled as emerging adults.&nbsp;<br /><br />Observers of unmarried emerging adults report many of them don't go to church because it is for families and they don't feel needed. Many of them go elsewhere to find themselves and their partners. And yet there is more than enough work to do in the Lord's Church, whether we are married or single. For example, I am aware of emerging adults who have felt inspired as they recapture their testimonies each day to index genealogical records, to do baptisms for the dead, or to volunteer to help with local community needs of the poor, or of children with reading or other disabilities. Indeed, many of them serve in these ways with other men and women their age. These are not callings but inspired ways of serving the Lord and His children.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />What I notice about these young adults is that as their eye becomes single to the glory of God through this service, they are filled with light.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;They become almost irresistible as future marriage partners and they grow in their experience and in their ability to receive God's guidance in ways that make them much more employable as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />My dear young friends, may God bless you as you find your paths to adulthood in God's kingdom by putting away your fears for the future and living fully today! May you recapture your testimony each day so that the Lord can guide your steps and help you get "unstuck" on the escalators of your life. May you see what you can do today to find how you can contribute to the work of the world. May you develop wholesome friendships so the Lord can guide you in finding an eternal companion and in your work as fathers and mothers. And may you forget yourself in serving God and His children and thus find and become your best self is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former Member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy</p>
<p>Bio not available. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some years ago President Gordon B. Hinckley said, "...the gospel is not a mass of theological jargon."<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;And with his characteristic directness, Elder Bruce R. McConkie stated, "The doctrine of the Atonement embraces, sustains, supports, and gives life and force to all other gospel doctrines....&nbsp; Indeed, the Atonement is the gospel."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Again, the Atonement of Jesus Christ is not a part of the gospel; it is the gospel. I once heard President Boyd K. Packer say the focus of the temple is a review of the plan of redemption authored by God and fulfilled by Jesus Christ involving the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement. There is that special word again - the Atonement. In all of its dimensions, the temple teaches us what the Atonement is and what it does.<br /><br /><strong>What is the Atonement?&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The word&nbsp;<em>atonement</em>&nbsp;is our English word meaning&nbsp;<em>at-one-ment.</em>&nbsp;It is only used once in the New Testament.<sup>3</sup><em>&nbsp;</em>That is a significant finding especially in light of our understanding that the Atonement is the very gospel itself. Perhaps a different way to understand the word "atonement" is to refer to another term used in the New Testament-"reconciliation."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Note this word comes from the Latin&nbsp;<em>reconcilio: cilio -&nbsp;</em>to be seated;&nbsp;<em>con</em>&nbsp;- with;&nbsp;<em>re &shy;-</em>&nbsp;again.&nbsp; Or, the reconciliation means "to be seated with God again." With this type of meaning in mind, that we are seated with God again, there are a number of scriptures we can review that give us insight into the greatness of what Jesus Christ has done for us and how the temple clarifies our purposes in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We have seen in many of our church buildings the painting of the Savior knocking on a door without a doorknob, inviting us in to sup or dine with Him.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Associated with this image are the powerful words of the Lord Himself: "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Likewise, the Book of Mormon often references being seated with God again in His throne.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;We also sing in Charles Wesley's wonderful hymn, "Come, Let Us Anew," "Oh, that each from his Lord that he may receive the glad word: 'Well and faithfully done; Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne....'"<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;This reconciliation or concept of sitting with Christ in His throne can have even more meaning as we participate in the temple and become aware of its symbolic ways of teaching us.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>What does the Atonement do?</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The temple teachings of the Atonement, in fact, prepare us to be comfortable with God in His presence. Think about it: "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly, then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For our confidence to wax strong, we will need to be comfortable there with God and indeed "have the mind of Christ."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;This may be a reason why we need to be endowed with the necessary power to be comfortable with God. In the temple we learn how we feel toward God and how His power is poured out upon all in the community. And it is the Atonement or reconciliation that allows us to be made comfortable in the presence of God. It suggests having the divine etiquette and the eternal manners which would make us comfortable in His presence. The temple is making us more comfortable in those essential manners - kindly thoughts, subdued voices and gracious behavior, to name a few.&nbsp;<br /><br />Can you imagine what a "culture shock" it would be to enter into the presence of God without some preparation? Through many of the ordinances and covenants performed only in the temple, we become prepared. In the first instance, we are taught more clearly to see even our premortal existence. The word "again" in "to be seated with God again" underscores that we were seated with Him once before. We are told that godliness is manifest in the ordinances.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Of significance for our own generation, the fullness of times, God has deigned to reveal these ordinances or those mysteries that have been kept hid from before the foundation of the world.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The special nature of these ordinances has now been given to our generation and time for our own and others' personal preparation to be qualified and comfortable with Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />I heard President Boyd K. Packer once say, "It is devotedly Christian to do work for the dead."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;This is another way the temple helps us in our preparation. Doing charitable work for those who have passed on prepares us with the gracious natures we will need to be seated with Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We all stumble in life and make sad errors which can generate feelings of not being worthy to stand in the presence of God and even being uncomfortable with the ones we may have hurt. Happily, we are assured that Christ was given power to make intercession for our sins and have His bowels of mercy being filled with compassion for us.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;With that bestowal of power a significant question is asked, "...who shall declare this generation?"<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;In my mind, that may mean that the Lord shall declare us clean,<em>&nbsp;</em>totally clean, so without any of those sad feelings we will sit comfortably with Him. Recall President Boyd K. Packer's statement that "The focus of the temple is... the Atonement...."<sup>16</sup>Hence, we need to see the Atonement in all that is there.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another aspect the temple teaches us is the clear understanding of the plan of redemption succinctly raised by Enoch's profound question to the Lord, "...How is it that thou canst weep?"<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;The Lord answered him, "Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency; and unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me...."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;So we were given knowledge, we were given agency, and we were given commandment that we should choose the Lord and do the things He would want us to do to prepare us to return to His presence. But, as the Lord stated, "...they are without affection and they hate their own blood,"<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;our human frailties come again. How is it that knowing this plan correctly, with the agency to use this knowledge and the commandments to love, we still make some mistakes along the way? Even knowing that, the Lord then has given us the pattern, the plan, and the pathway back to His presence. President James E. Faust said, "In the temples of the Lord, we learn obedience. We learn sacrifice. We make the vows of chastity and have our lives consecrated to holy purposes. It is possible for us to be purged and purified and to have our sins washed away so that we may come before the Lord as clean, white, and spotless as the newly fallen snow."<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>What is this pattern and pathway back to Him?</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><em>Obedience</em>. The word "obedience," likewise, has a Latin root:&nbsp;<em>ob<strong>,</strong></em>&nbsp;meaning "facing," "facing toward," or "looking up." While the word,&nbsp;<em>oboedire</em>, directly from Latin, means, "to hear." We need to hear or face toward God, the correct source. So, obedience is really<em>&nbsp;</em>listening to Him or truly<em>&nbsp;</em>facing Him. Where we are really looking toward Him for all of our direction is in the temple. President Ezra Taft Benson stated, "When obedience ceases to be an irritant and becomes our quest, in that moment God will endow us with power."<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Then we will have the assurance necessary to make those personal sacrifices that will make us comfortable in His presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Sacrifice</em>&nbsp;also comes from the Latin word -&nbsp;<em>sacri facio</em>&nbsp;- or for those who speak Portuguese,&nbsp;<em>sacri fazer</em>;&nbsp;<em>fazer -&nbsp;</em>to become,&nbsp;<em>sacri</em>&nbsp;- holy, or meaning "to become holy." So we can view the sacrifices in our lives, such as giving away our sins,<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;as a means for us to become holy, to become more prepared, more like Him in thought and deed, and thusly "have the mind of Christ."<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Hence, we can become personally worthy, with those vows of chastity, and feel that comfort we desire in the presence of God. Confidence, even in secular or scientific matters, comes from obedience to our knowledge and understanding of laws and rules. We cannot pick and choose in our own cafeteria of obedience and sacrifice and fail to follow His steps and expect to feel comfortable in His presence. Cervantes reminds us "No man is born wise"<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;and President James E. Faust said, "Without turning back to the word of our Creator, no one is wise enough to sort out what ethical, spiritual and moral values should be taught the next generation..."<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, we will need to face God, get the correct direction, do it with those holy purposes in mind and thus become sanctified.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;In the end we do seem to get what we desire.<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;As C.S. Lewis said, "It is safe to tell the pure in heart that they shall see God, for only the pure in heart want to."<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>What are some of the blessings that come because of our temple worship?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There are some "small and simple things"<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;that can be helpful to us as we make that journey from obedience to sacrifice to personal worthiness. Some years ago, the first time I saw one of my daughters playing volleyball, I noticed that, when she made a mistake, she immediately pointed to her chest and said, "My bad." Over the years I have watched excellent athletes, when they make a mistake, quickly say or gesture, "My bad." I have concluded that the importance of that simple statement, "My bad," can become a pattern in our lives and help us make the swift journey along the path of complete obedience, sacrifice, and personal worthiness. When we quickly say, "My bad," there is no room for blaming another person; there is no room for making excuses or saying, "Well, he made me do it," or "she made me do it."&nbsp; It is the immediate recognition that it is "my bad." Hence, we get into a pattern of developing more confidence because we have immediately recognized that what transpired "is what it is." We made the mistake, it is "our bad," and we need to move on, changing our very attitude or behavior, thus becoming clean and finally comfortable in His presence. The blessing of the temple assures us of that reconciliation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another blessing of the temple that comes into our lives is that we recognize that "your joy in this world is not full, but in me your joy is full."<sup>30</sup>Indeed, with the bigger view of His plan we are able to make sense out of this chaotic world with all its ups and downs.&nbsp;Yet another great blessing of the temple is that we can answer one of the biggest philosophical and theological questions. That is, "How can God's blessings be made available to all people, even those before Christ, those who died without a testimony of Jesus, those who died in various parts of the world that never had the gospel?" There is no other plan, no other philosophy, or no other church that responds to God's ultimate fairness as seen in the temple.&nbsp;<br /><br />When the Prophet Joseph Smith was about 18 years old, on September 21, 1823, the Angel Moroni came to him and recited a well-known scripture, "And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.&nbsp; If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming."<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;The temple and the nature of the saving ordinances and covenants show that the earth and its people will not be utterly wasted, but they will all have the same great, grand opportunities of salvation because of the ultimate fairness of God in doing vicarious work for others.&nbsp;<br /><br />In describing the significance of the temple, the Prophet Joseph Smith used a very interesting word. Again from the Latin, "<em>summum bonum,</em>"<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;which denotes "the highest good." What is the highest good of the whole subject that is lying before us? It "consists in obtaining the powers of the Holy Priesthood. For him to whom these keys are given, there is no difficulty in obtaining knowledge of facts in relation to the salvation of the children of men, for the dead as well as for the living."<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Notice the distinction between having the priesthood and obtaining the powers of the holy priesthood.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Other wonderful blessings come from the temple. Our families are organized and sealed together. We are protected from temptation and evil. We are given a refining and ennobling power, we receive inspiration and revelation, and we are given promises and endowed with those gifts of light, of truth, and of understanding. We are bound together, there is a sealing together.&nbsp; Here again, an interesting Latin-based word "religion,"&nbsp;<em>re-ligio.</em>&nbsp;<em>Ligio,&nbsp;</em>"to be connected" or "bound."&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Re</em>, "again." So&nbsp;<em>religion</em>&nbsp;means "to bind us to God again" and what more clear binding than the sealing of a family forever.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are given promises, even as the times get more harsh and financial difficulties occur, that if our hearts are prepared "thy people may not faint in the day of trouble."<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Many of us will go through days of highs and lows and troubles, but we have the guarantee that we will not faint, that we will be able to be strong and lift ourselves and others because there is a quietness and a reverence that can happen to us and to our souls - a quietness and assurance forever.<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;When this quietness and assurance comes, the Holy Spirit can inspire us<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;to ask those "find out" questions about the hierarchy of truths, which gives even more assurance to our souls.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brigham Young is reportedly to have said, "All men will certify by their actions what they truly believe." So temple worship is also the means by which we are certified of what we truly believe. During the Nauvoo era the Lord emphasized this when He said, "And again, verily I say unto you, I command you again to build a house to my name, even in this place, that you may prove yourselves unto me that ye are faithful in all things whatsoever I command you, that I may bless you, and crown you with honor, immortality, and eternal life."<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes people have felt, "Why should I go to the temple when I can just as easily find solitude, serenity and even reverence in the mountains or by a mountain stream?" But, the Lord has told us that there is a difference between worshipping the creations and worshipping the Creator. This can be seen in the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland temple, "And when thy people transgress, any of them, they may speedily repent and return unto thee, and find favor in thy sight, and be restored to the blessings which thou hast ordained to be poured out upon those who shall reverence thee in thy house."<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;So there is a special ordained blessing for those who will speedily repent and return and reverence Him in His house. The Lord will forgive and have mercy as part of that reconciliation for "naught but peace, justice, and truth is the habitation of thy throne; and mercy shall go before thy face and have no end...."<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;Isn't it a wonderful blessing that mercy will forever go before His face so that we can happily sit down with Him in the presence of God!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Ten years ago when the twin towers were destroyed in New York City by terrorists, the Russians decided to send the Americans a gift of support in our great national grief. The gift they chose was a large stone monument with a large platinum teardrop in the middle of the monument. At the bottom is an inscription from 2 Chronicles 7:14. King Solomon had just asked the Lord to accept the temple he had built. The Lord replied, "If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place."<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;The Lord is attent unto our prayers made in that sacred place, the temple. In a meeting I attended, President Boyd K. Packer taught that we are under the watch care of the Almighty, and He has already solved problems we couldn't solve.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to share two experiences while presiding in the Ogden Utah Temple. One day while watching individuals enter into one of the endowment rooms in the temple, I noticed a very elderly blind lady who was walking in. As she turned around the corner, I saw another lady, also using a walker, holding onto her arm helping her in. Then behind her, some men with crutches and in wheelchairs came in. I felt how wonderful it is that God will listen and solve their problems, and has solved their problems by having other kind people helping them. Immediately the Savior's compassion toward the Nephite sick came to mind, "Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt or maimed...Bring them hither and I will heal them...my bowels are filled with mercy"<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;I saw the Lord's graciousness to us all in that one session.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the second incident, a mother, son, and daughter (all of appropriate temple age) were extremely sad one evening. Noticing their distress, I asked if I could be of help. They mentioned that her husband, their father, had just been in a very serious accident and was on life support at the local hospital. Therefore, they were in the temple to discern direction regarding the very serious brain injury that had occurred. They also had a son in the mission field at the time and wondered whether he should come home. As I saw their difficult struggle, it was wonderful to see and discuss how the clear temple teachings of the Plan of Redemption and Happiness literally settled their hearts and minds. We, all, had our testimonies strengthened in the knowledge that our Father in Heaven really is in complete control. This family became peaceful, assured and comforted knowing that our Heavenly Father had already solved those problems they could not solve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We are all being prepared to go back and sit with God again. The temple is where that preparation will make us comfortable to actually be there. We read in Proverbs, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding."<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;I bear witness that the temple is indeed the House of the Lord where we can gain a holy understanding of the Father and the Son. This I humbly leave with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emeritus Member, Presidency of the Seventy</p>
<p>President Rex D. Pinegar, the newest member of the First Council of the Seventy, was raised in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mormon.org/values/family">family</a>&nbsp;richly endowed with love and concern for the individual member. These choice traits have not been diminished by the transition from childhood to adulthood, as President Pinegar demonstrates love and respect in his attitude toward his own wife and children.<br /><br />President Pinegar was born September 18, 1931, in Orem, Utah, a twin son and one of twelve children born to John F. and Grace Murl Ellis Pinegar. He was reared in the agricultural community of Spanish Fork, Utah, where he and his brothers and sisters earned their pocket money working in the local orchards and on farms.<br /><br />As a youth of twelve, he followed his older brothers into a job with the local creamery&nbsp;and worked for a construction company throughout his junior high and senior high school years.<br /><br />His work and experiences conditioned him for championship football and wrestling activities in high school and aided him in his energetic pursuit of his schooling and his Church activities. He was active in his priesthood quorums and in the Scouting program. After graduation from high school in 1949, he entered the U.S. Navy for four years.<br /><br />"For about a year I was instructing officers in cargo handling, and for the remainder of the time, I served in the Pacific. I enjoyed my experience as an instructor, but when I completed my term with the navy and entered Brigham Young University, I was thinking of becoming a commercial artist."However, after his first year in college, he decided to become a teacher, thus fulfilling an unvoiced hope of his mother. During this first year, he also decided to marry Bonnie Lee Crabb.<br /><br />"We grew up together in the same ward. She was much younger than I--at least that's what I thought at the time. On my return from the Navy, I found that the little neighborhood girl had grown up and had completed her freshman year at BYU."<br /><br />The Pinegars were married in the Salt Lake Temple on January 24, 1955, and they now have five children: Kevin, 17; Lisa, 15; Suzanne, 12; Shelley, 10; and Kristen, 5.<br /><br />After graduating from BYU, President Pinegar took his family to California, where he did graduate work at San Francisco State College for his master's degree and at the University of Southern California for his doctorate in education.<br /><br />While pursuing his graduate studies in California, President Pinegar served as a stake missionary, stake YMMIA president, and was active in his seventies quorums in Hayward Stake and then in Glendale Stake. He also taught seminary and institute of religion classes.<br /><br />Upon receiving his doctorate in 1967, he returned to BYU as a member of the special education faculty and later became chairman of educational psychology in the College of Education.<br /><br />He was serving as a member of the Sunday School general board when he received a call in 1971 to preside over the North Carolina-Virginia Mission. (His twin brother Max was called at the same time to preside over the Netherlands Mission.)<br /><br />"When the call came for me to be a mission president, it made me very happy. I had never served as a full-time missionary and had thought the opportunity to do so might never come. Now to serve as a mission president is a wonderful, rewarding experience for me and my entire family. Our association with our faithful missionaries and members has been a choice blessing for us."<br /><br />It was while he was away from the mission home holding a zone conference in early October that he received a telephone call from the First Presidency's office. When he returned the call, the telephone was answered by President Harold B. Lee himself.<br /><br />"That was quite startling. I had expected to speak with his secretary. President Lee was very understanding of my feelings at that moment, and he immediately asked if I were seated. I had no thought at all that I would be called to this position or any other."<br /><br />His calling as a member of the First Council of the Seventy will be a continuation of his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mormon.org/values/missionary-work">missionary work</a>&nbsp;and an outgrowth of his love and concern for the individual.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I'm grateful to be at BYU-Idaho, an institution where faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is seen as an essential element of learning and teaching. You are led by a president of great moral strength and courage.<br /><br />&nbsp;With President Clark's permission, I would like to share, with slight corrections, a quote that appeared recently in the&nbsp;<em>Deseret News</em>. The dateline is Sunday, October 16, 2011. Location of the event: Aspen, Colorado.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Kim Clark sat on the stage waiting for his name to be announced...That Clark was here, speaking at the prestigious Aspen Symposium of the Forum on the Future of Higher Education, struck him as remarkable. The annual summer gathering draws a "who's who" of America's most innovative thinkers and leaders in higher education, including presidents and other senior administrators of America's leading universities and colleges...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"That Clark had been asked to address the group on innovation in American higher education was intriguing to many in the crowd. Clark was the former Harvard Business School Dean, but he now presided over a school in eastern Idaho most people in the audience had never heard of. Once called Ricks College, it had been re-christened BYU-Idaho, and Clark was here to talk about how the school was reshaping the landscape of higher education.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Midway through his presentation, he shifted to the role faith plays in the BYU-Idaho Learning Model. He introduced a slide entitled: 'Principles of the BYU-Idaho Learning Model.'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The first line on the slide read: 'Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is a principle of action and power.' 'This is the first principle of the learning model of BYU-Idaho," President Clark declared...'"<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>I wish to stay true to this "first principle" by centering my remarks today on the power of faith.<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was being considered for a teaching position on the faculty of Brigham Young University, I was interviewed by Elder Boyd K. Packer of the Quorum of the Twelve. After a few minutes of friendly greeting, President Packer asked, "Brother Pinegar, what is your philosophy of education?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Although I had anticipated such an inquiry, I wasn't quite sure how I would answer that question. After pondering briefly, I replied that I only knew of one philosophy for teaching - that was the gospel of Jesus Christ. That must have been the right answer because I was hired.&nbsp;<br /><br />The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only true philosophy and&nbsp; "model" for teaching and learning. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is a true principle of action and power in all aspects of our lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Hinckley taught, "If there is one thing you or I need in this world it is faith, that dynamic, powerful, marvelous element by which, as Paul declared, the very worlds were framed. Faith - the kind of faith that moves one to get on his knees and plead with the Lord and then get on his feet and go to work - is an asset beyond compare, even in the acquisition of secular knowledge by His Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Leo Tolstoy, a famous Russian writer, declared, "Faith is the force of life." Tolstoy had spent the major portion of his life seeking to understand life's purpose. He found fame, position, fortune. He married well and had a family. He had experienced success by nearly every measure the world uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />He sought answers to the meaning of life from his studies of science, philosophy, and other fields of knowledge. However, all the knowledge he acquired, honors he received, and personal accomplishments he achieved, brought no lasting satisfaction. Life still seemed to him meaningless. At this point of deepest despair, Tolstoy asked the question, "How am I to live?" The answer came: "By the law of God."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Tolstoy had been diligent in all he had done; now he was turning, in faith, to prayer for answers.&nbsp; He was then compelled to admit that "besides the reasoning knowledge" there is "in every living man another kind of knowledge, an unreasoning one. But which gives a possibility of living - faith. Faith is the force of life."<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Tolstoy had found that through diligent personal efforts, one can possess about all one could desire of worldly pleasure and acclaim; but without faith in God, accompanied by faithful prayer, life can burden the heart, mind, and even the soul.&nbsp;<br /><br />Faith is the "the force of life;" and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is indeed a true principle of action and power. With gospel truths serving as the foundation for all learning and teaching at BYU-Idaho, how great the advantage to those who teach and study here.&nbsp;<br /><br />As one of my daughters was leaving home to attend college she gave me a sweet message of thanks and appreciation - and then expressed her anxiety about the responsibilities she would now encounter being on her own. She felt she had lived a sheltered life and had relied much on her family to provide direction and strength. She was now beginning to realize that life can sometimes be hard.&nbsp;<br /><br />My daughter's concerns may have been much like the concerns some of you feel today. This can be a time of trials and testing and you may be asking, "How can I successfully meet the challenges of life?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Leaving home is not easy. Pursuing an education can press us to our financial, emotional and intellectual limits. However, making important decisions, choosing the proper path to follow and pursuing all worthwhile endeavors usually, require total spiritual and physical dedication. C. S. Lewis wrote: "The great thing, if one can, is to stop regarding all the unpleasant things as interruptions of one's 'own' or 'real' life - the life God is sending one, day by day."<sup>4</sup><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br /><br />We will be able to face and conquer our challenges more willingly and courageously when we understand that such obstacles are encountered as a natural part of living, and that our Heavenly Father has provided the way and the means for us to successfully meet the "unpleasant interruptions" that are part of our "real life."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord has made available to us, through prayer and faith, powers which will turn our challenges into opportunities. These are powers which will enable us to understand the Apostle Peter's declaration that such trials of our faith are indeed more precious than gold; experiences that will strengthen and refine us.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I like the counsel Brigham Young wrote to one of his sons who was attending a university in New York:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As you advance in life you will find every position and occupation surrounded by its peculiar temptations, the great strength, and bulwark against all of which is prayer to our Heavenly Father. Cultivate this spirit and you will find that it shall be a wall of fire around you and your glory in the midst of you. In its practice, you will find a safeguard against the wiles of the adversary, and every good resolution will be fortified by it, and every seductive influence will lose its power to annoy you."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>With the powerful blessing of prayer we may develop the talents and abilities to deal with every situation. Each of us is to use those talents and abilities we receive from the Lord to make our way through the tests and opportunities of life. That which we learn through our schooling, our personal efforts and our experience is intended to enhance our natural gifts and to increase our ability to find joy and fulfillment in life.&nbsp;<br /><br />We should not fear the challenges of life, but approach them with prayers of faith and lean upon the Lord's miraculous strength and mighty power. The Lord has promised, "All victory and glory is brought to pass unto you through your diligence, faithfulness and prayers of faith."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />As a young man I participated on our high school wrestling team. We were in a tournament that included teams we had met earlier in the year. My opponent was a young man whom I had defeated in our last match. This time when we met with the referee in the center of the mat, he looked at me with a determination and said, "This is my time, Pinegar!" I responded, "Oh, no!&nbsp; This is my time and I'm going to beat you today!"&nbsp;<br /><br />But, he was serious. He attacked me with a fury I had not seen in him previously. You might say he turned me every way but loose. In the third and final round of the match, he had me in a position that could result in a pin for him. I could feel my grip on him was slipping. He held my body in such a position that the only way I could look was up. As I looked up I saw a rather large man sitting several rows up in the bleachers. His face was somewhat contorted and it appeared to me he was twisting and turning as if to help me get out of my predicament. When the thought came to me that he was trying to help me I knew with his help I could reverse my position and come off victorious.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was as if added strength came to me. With a burst of power I rolled over and pinned my opponent. What a victory that was for me! Then I looked around, wanting to find the man who had given me the confidence I needed to change what seemed a doomed position into victory. I found him - he was my Dad.&nbsp;<br /><br />This experience reinforced my confidence in my Heavenly Father. It is often a reminder to me even now that when we are in trouble or facing a challenge of any kind, we need only to look up. Our Heavenly Father is there, pulling for us. His love will reach out to us and increase our faith and strength to be able to overcome whatever obstacle we are dealing with.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was in graduate school at the University of Southern California I had the opportunity to teach early morning seminary. We paused at the end of the year to review some principles we had learned from our study of the Book of Mormon. One young lady held up her Book of Mormon showing an illustration by Arnold Friberg. It depicted the two thousand sons of Helaman, known as the "stripling warriors."&nbsp; Then in all seriousness she asked, "Tell me, Brother Pinegar. Why aren't our young men built like this today?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, I don't know that the young men in the days of the sons of Helaman were built the way Arnold Friberg painted them, but her question gave me the opportunity to ask, "Where did the strength of these young men come from?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Those of you who have read the Book of Mormon are familiar with the story of the sons of Helaman. When their fathers were converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ they covenanted with the Lord that they would never again take up arms. But eventually their homes and families were threatened by hostile armies to the extent that the fathers would have to choose to fight or die. And, they would die rather than break the covenant they had made with the Lord. It was then that the two thousand young men, not being bound by the same covenant as their fathers, volunteered to defend their parents and their homes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Helaman, their general, recorded:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"They were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all - they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them... And they ... fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What gave the sons of Helaman their strength? It was their faith in God which moved them to action with&nbsp; "miraculous strength" and "mighty power."</p>
<p>A young man recently told me, "If I had known how difficult a mission was going to be, I would not have gone. But now I'm glad I served a mission because I learned I can do hard things." Serving a mission is hard; but because he turned his life over to the Lord, he was strengthened and enabled by the power of faith to do all things that were required of him. He now knows from where his strength will come to face other challenges and "hard things" that may come his way.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some years ago I was assigned to a stake conference in San Diego, California. It was a hot, humid Saturday in June when I stepped off the plane and began searching for the stake president among the faces in the crowded waiting area. Although we had spoken to each other on the telephone we had never met in person. It was not difficult to spot him. He was the one person wearing a dark suit and tie. He was standing against the waiting room wall. As I approached him he smiled and I smiled and asked, "How are you, president?" His reply was a pleasant, "I'm happy!" I loved that greeting.&nbsp;<br /><br />Throughout the day the president used that same response whenever he was asked the proverbial question, "How are you?" I determined that I would ask him about that greeting. As we were driving toward his home that evening, he beat me to it. "Elder Pinegar," he said, "you want to ask me a question."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"I do?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Yes. You want to know why I say, 'I'm happy.'"&nbsp;<br /><br />I admitted that I was curious and asked him to tell me the origin of this now familiar greeting.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is his story:&nbsp;<br /><br />He was called to serve a mission at age 19. During his initial interview with his mission president, he told him he did not want to be there. He wanted to go home. The president told him he couldn't send him home. He couldn't release him because he was not the one who had called him on his mission. He would have to stay. The young elder resigned himself to being in the mission, but he determined he would not work. Every weekly letter to the president contained a request for a release from the mission. In every personal interview with the mission president, he asked to go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />After one such interview following a zone meeting, the president said, "Okay, Elder, you are going home. I've arranged for one of my assistants to remain with your companion."&nbsp; The missionary could hardly believe what was happening. They drove to his apartment where he packed up his things, said goodbye to his companion, and then drove away. He was happy!He was going home!&nbsp;<br /><br />As they traveled, the missionary began to express his gratitude to the president for allowing him to go home. "Oh," said the president. "I'm not sending you to your home. I'm taking you to the mission home. I'm turning you over to my wife."&nbsp;<br /><br />"But I don't want to go to the mission home. I want to go to my home," the missionary insisted. They drove on in silence.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was dinnertime when they pulled into the driveway of the mission home. The president's wife came out to the car. With a bright smile she greeted her husband and then welcomed the frustrated missionary to her home with a question: "How are you, Elder?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />With a frown and an angry voice, he told her he was not happy to be there. He wanted to go to his own home. She smiled and said, "Elder, that's the wrong answer. Now, look at me with a smile and say 'I'm happy!"&nbsp;<br /><br />"But I'm not happy! I just want to go home."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Wrong answer, Elder! Let's try that again. How are you, Elder?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />His response was the same. "I'm not happy. I want to go home."&nbsp;<br /><br />"Wrong answer!" the mission president's wife replied.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The fourth time she repeated the question, he was tired of what he considered "her little game," and responded, without a smile, "Okay, I'm happy."&nbsp;<br /><br />"Good," she said. "Now we can eat dinner!" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For four days, whenever the president's wife saw him, she would pester him with the same question. He continued to reply, "I'm not happy! I want to go home!"&nbsp;<br /><br />On the fourth night as the elder was walking down the hallway toward his room he saw her coming from the opposite direction. He knew what she was going to say, but this time he would surprise her with the "right answer." "How are you tonight, Elder?" she asked.&nbsp;<br /><br />"I'm happy!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"That's great, Elder. Now you can go back to work."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This time he was more emphatic as he responded. He did not want to go to work. He wanted to go home. In a concerned but kind way she invited him to meet with her in the dining room. She had something she wanted to share with him.&nbsp;<br /><br />As they sat opposite each other at a large table, she looked him squarely in the eyes and told him that he should be a happy, grateful young man. He had the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the only true plan of happiness in the world. Only through this plan could he, or anyone, find true joy in living. By following it he could learn everything he needed to know and to do in order to find success and real happiness in life. She told him how the principles of the gospel blessed her life for good; how the power of faith and the atonement of Jesus Christ gave her strength to deal with the challenges and difficulties in life. She assured him that through faith and prayer he would be able to fulfill the mission to which he had been called.&nbsp;<br /><br />As she expressed her deep feelings of faith and joy in the gospel he was filled with the Spirit and somehow his heart changed. He knew what she was saying was true. He was filled with gratitude that the Lord trusted him and had called him to share this great plan of happiness with others. He felt a strong desire to be a missionary, and he received the strength of faith to continue.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the conclusion of their conversation, the mission president's wife sweetly asked,&nbsp; "How are you, Elder?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, he sincerely responded,&nbsp; "I'm happy!"&nbsp;<br /><br />As the stake president concluded his story he said, "Elder Pinegar, from that time until now I have always responded with that truth, 'I'm happy!'"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We And he is! However, life has not always been easy for this man. He and his family have experienced some very trying challenges; but they have retained their faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ - the Lord's true plan of happiness. Everyone needs the strength that comes from having faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and the understanding, as President Clark declared, that "faith is a principle of action and power."&nbsp;<br /><br />In a recent&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>&nbsp;article, President Thomas S. Monson wrote: "Someone has said that 'the recognition of (a) power higher than man himself does not in any sense debase him.'"<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />The Savior himself prayed mightily with Heavenly Father in the Garden of Gethsemane as He faced the day of his crucifixion. He pleaded with his Father to remove this trial from him. And He continued in prayer, "saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done." As he prayed, "there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him." Through faith and prayer he received the necessary strength from the Father to willingly fulfill his redemptive mission.<sup>10</sup><em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />God may not remove obstacles or challenges facing us, but he can and does send the comfort, guidance and strength we need to get through the trial. As we diligently move forward on our life's journey with the power of faith we will find the strength and the will to meet each additional challenge as it comes before us.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Monson teaches of prayer and faith and urges all of us to pray to seek divine help. Then President Monson makes this wonderful promise: "No such sincere, prayerful effort will go unanswered: that is the very constitution of the philosophy of faith.<em>&nbsp;</em>Divine favor will attend those who humbly seek it."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />May each of us approach life with sincere prayer and put into action the power which comes from faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We will be blessed. And, we will be happy! I testify to the reality of Jesus Christ, and of the truths discussed this day, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>I am grateful to be here at Brigham Young University&shy;&shy;-Idaho. I have tremendous admiration for the faculty, administration, and students here and I'm honored to be asked to speak to you. However, I confess I was surprised when I received the invitation. I was reminded of something President Marion G. Romney said once when he spoke to a group:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I am not here because I consider myself a speaker, for I do not . . . . I did not seek the invitation so graciously extended to me. As a matter of fact, I demurred to it at first. It was not until I had slept upon it overnight that I accepted. When I did, it was out of charity toward you. Pondering why the invitation came to me, I was driven to conclude that all speakers of superior excellence were unavailable. That led me to the awful sequel that if I refused, you would be driven to accept a speaker worse than I. So no matter how poor this talk turns out to be, I charge you to remember that it might have been worse."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>I want to talk about the importance of following the living prophets. As far back as I can remember, I have admired those we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators. I wasn't the most observant person as a child--I still am not--but I knew how important the gospel was to my parents, and I had a clear sense that they loved and honored Church leaders. I apparently had an inkling about the importance of prophets when I was quite young. When I was three or four years old, I was asked to say a prayer at the end of a family home evening. I asked Heavenly Father to "Bless Joseph Sniff to join the Mormon Church." My family has never let me live that down.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was 16 or 17 years old, my father had been out of town and my mother asked me if I could pick him up at the airport. This was before 9/11, so we were allowed to walk out to the gate where the plane docked to meet the passengers. As I was walking down the concourse to meet my father, I noticed that he was talking to an older gentleman in a suit and, as I got closer, I realized it was President Harold B. Lee. In the group I hung out with at that stage of my life, it wasn't very cool to be "churchy," but I wasn't completely clueless, so I knew what President Lee looked like.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I remember having two distinct impressions as I drew closer to them; first, that President Lee was shorter than I thought he was--perhaps seeing him on TV made me think he was larger than life. The second impression was that there was an almost visible spiritual presence that emanated from President Lee. I could not mistake that this man was remarkable, that there was something noble--even holy--about him.&nbsp;<br /><br />A few years later, as a missionary in the old Language Training Mission at BYU, I watched the solemn assembly session where President Lee was sustained as President of the Church. I was deeply moved as I heard him speak. I learned about 18 months into my mission that he had suddenly passed away. I was shocked and saddened! I hardly knew President Spencer W. Kimball, but I felt that, if I was to testify to those in the mission field that we are led by prophets, I would need to gain a witness of President Kimball's divine calling as I had President Lee's. I prayed fervently for that witness. I can still picture that room in my mind as I prayed, and the strong assurance of the Spirit that President Kimball was the man whom the Lord wanted to lead the Church at that time.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have long had a witness of the importance of following the living prophets, but in recent years, I have thought more about the connection between following the living prophets and other vital gospel principles. One of the most important things we can do in this life is to become saints--true disciples of Christ--who demonstrate Christ-like virtues. In Mosiah 3: 19, we learn that we can become "...a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and [become] as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father."&nbsp;<br /><br />Alma 7:23-24 adds a few more traits:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; . . . always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.&nbsp; And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works."</p>
<p>I believe the saintly virtues listed by King Benjamin and Alma are not only ultimate goals for each of us in the quest of discipleship, they are virtues characteristic of one who is willing to follow the living prophet. Can I really be humble, meek, submissive, easy to be entreated, obedient, and faithful, if I am not willing to hearken to the counsel of God's prophets? I can't imagine that a person who has developed these godly attributes would not also show a willingness to follow the Brethren.&nbsp;<br /><br />In contrast to these virtues, think for a moment of what we know of Satan's character traits.&nbsp; We read in Moses 4 about his plan to forcibly bring all of us back to Heavenly Father. &nbsp;The Lord tells us that Satan 1) rebelled against the Lord, 2) sought to destroy the agency of man, and 3) wanted God's power. So, his rebelliousness is in stark contrast to a saint's submissiveness; one who wants to destroy our agency can hardly be described as charitable, patient, or longsuffering. And is someone who covets God's power humble, childlike, and gentle? This experience from the pre-mortal council suggests that an unwillingness to hearken to the Lord--and to his anointed--is in large measure an issue of taming our ego, of becoming meek, and of developing faith.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Followership and the Saintly Virtues</strong></p>
<p>We're entering an election year when there is so much focus on leaders. Many books have been written about leadership. We read of seminars on leadership offered in our communities. I wonder if we spend enough time thinking and talking about what it takes to be a good follower. I'll mention just a few virtues referred to in these two passages of scripture and talk about how those traits describe people who love and follow our modern prophets. I wish there were time to mention more of the virtues.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Willing to submit, easy to be entreated, and faith</strong>.</p>
<p>The saintly attributes of spiritual submissiveness, being easy to be entreated, and having faith are perhaps more closely tied together than we realize. One of the best ways to show the Lord we are submissive to Him is by following the counsel of his mouthpieces. President Marion G. Romney made the wry observation that there are too many of us in the Church who are willing to serve the Lord, "but only in an advisory capacity."<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Years ago, I read a story about President Romney that made a deep impression on me. There is a political background to this story, but the story is not about<em>&nbsp;</em>political parties. It's about a principle President Romney's decision illustrates.&nbsp;<br /><br />Before he was called as a General Authority, Marion G. Romney was a state legislator and a prominent member of the Democratic Party in Utah. As the 1936 election neared, it was viewed by both parties as a referendum on the record of the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt's opponents pressed him to declare himself willing to abide by the decisions of the Supreme Court. When he would not do that, the&nbsp;<em>Deseret News&nbsp;</em>published an unattributed<em>&nbsp;</em>front-page editorial the Saturday before the election (without mentioning Roosevelt by name) saying that the record of one of the candidates could be construed to indicate he would press for unconstitutional legislation. The editorial urged Church members to vote to protect the Constitution.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Romney's biographer records that, when the editorial appeared, Romney was stunned. As a democratic politician working on the re-election committee of the democratic governor of Utah, he felt that his political life had collapsed around him. It was only an editorial, and some would argue it was a legal matter and not an ecclesiastical one, but it was on the front page of the newspaper considered the voice of the Church.&nbsp;<br /><br />He began to fast. He went to his law office, locked the door, and when he left after three hours of anguished prayer, he had received an assurance that the editorial was inspired and had been written by the Church president. He believed he had no choice but to resign from the governor's committee, which he did, and then spent his efforts from that time until the election trying to dissuade his friends from voting for Franklin Roosevelt. The election was a landslide. Democratic party candidates were swept into power at all levels of government. President Romney soon realized he'd made a costly political decision, but he believed he had done the right thing and that was enough for him.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I wonder whether I would have the courage to do what President Romney did. He believed in the divine calling of modern prophets and he was submissive. In his first General Conference talk, he made this telling observation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I have never been very particular to determine when [Church leaders] were speaking as prophets of God and when they were speaking as men. . . . It has been the rule of my life to find out if I could, by listening closely to what they said and by asking the Lord to help me interpret it, what they had in mind for the Latter-day Saints to do and then do it. I am happy to say, not boastfully, but gratefully, that I have never hesitated to follow the counsel of the Authorities of the Church, even though it crossed my social, professional, or political life."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>If we receive the witness of the Spirit that those we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators are in fact called of God and inspired by him, this conviction should govern our behavior all of the time. It requires deep-seated faith to follow prophetic counsel.</p>
<p>In a talk to Church educators, President Thomas S. Monson taught: "Follow the prophets of God. When you follow the prophets, you will be in safe territory. I know the Lord inspires His prophets, His seers, and His revelators."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;If we reflect on our lives and on Church history, we will recall experiences when safety has come from heeding prophetic counsel.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Meek</strong>. A saint is also meek. If we are meek, we will understand that counsel and correction from prophets will help us stay on the straight and narrow path. President Boyd K. Packer pointed out a lesson on meekness that can be drawn from what occurred at the Last Supper, after the Savior said, "One of you shall betray me."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;President Packer said:</p>
<p>"I remind you that these men were apostles. They were of apostolic stature. It has always been interesting to me that they did not on that occasion nudge one another and say, 'I'll bet that is old Judas. He has surely been acting [strange] lately.' It reflects something of their stature. Rather, it is recorded: 'They were exceedingly sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?' (Matthew 26: 22). Would you, I plead, overrule the tendency to disregard counsel and assume for just a moment something apostolic in attitude at least and ask yourself these questions: 'Do I need to improve myself? Should I take this counsel to heart and act upon it? If there is one weak or failing, unwilling to follow the Brethren, Lord, is it I?'"<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><strong>Humble</strong>.</p>
<p>Saints are humble. The proud think they know more than God (and his prophets). Truman Madsen tells a story about an experience Brigham Young had with the Prophet Joseph that has been passed down by Brigham Young's descendants.&nbsp;<br /><br />In a meeting the Prophet Joseph sternly rebuked Brigham Young for something he had done, or something he was supposed to have done but hadn't. The detail is not clear. Perhaps the Prophet was deliberately putting Brigham to a test. When the Prophet Joseph had finished the rebuke, everyone in the room waited for the response. Brigham Young rose to his feet and, in a voice everyone could tell was sincere, said simply, "Joseph, what do you want me to do?" The story says that the Prophet burst into tears, came down from the stand, and threw his arms around Brigham.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Of those originally called to the Quorum of the Twelve, Brigham Young was one of only two who never apostatized. I love Brigham Young for the way he sustained the Prophet Joseph.&nbsp;<br /><br />The saintly virtues are traits that are not only in short supply in our time, they are considered by many to be a sign of weakness. But those who follow the Master, who described himself as meek and lowly of heart, are expected to develop these traits. If we are faced with prophetic direction that troubles us, perhaps we ought to pause and ask ourselves, "I wonder what the Brethren know that I don't know?"&nbsp;<br /><br />The Brethren are watchmen on the tower, in the prophet Ezekiel's phrase. They have both a breadth and a quality of vision that the rest of us do not have, and we are wise and humble if we are aware of this fact.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Patient</strong>.</p>
<p>A saint is patient. It's interesting to note that, in speaking to the saints in the early years of the Church, the Lord commanded them to receive Joseph's word in "patience and faith."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;It may not always be readily apparent why we have received a particular piece of counsel, but disciples of Christ are willing to act now and wait for further understanding down the road.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><br /><br />Elder Neal A. Maxwell noted, "Prophets are alerted to tiny trends that bode ill for mankind.&nbsp; Prophets, therefore, are the Lord's early-warning system: they both detect and decry at his direction. What may seem to be a premature expression of prophetic concern is actually the early discovery of a difficulty that will later plague the people."<sup>10</sup><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><br /><br />Let me mention an example of a recent expression of prophetic concern about a difficulty that now plagues society, both globally and, for many of us, individually. In a talk in 1998, President Gordon B. Hinckley mentioned Joseph in Egypt's interpretation of Pharoah's dream, then observed:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We have witnessed in recent weeks wide and fearsome swings in the markets of the world. The economy is a fragile thing. A stumble in the economy in Jakarta or Moscow can immediately affect the entire world. It can eventually reach down to each of us as individuals. There is a portent of stormy weather ahead to which we had better give heed. . . .&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I urge you, brethren, to look to the condition of your finances. I urge you to be modest in your expenditures; discipline yourselves in your purchases to avoid debt to the extent possible. Pay off debt as quickly as you can, and free yourselves from bondage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If you have paid your debts, if you have a reserve, even though it be small, then should storms howl about your head, you will have shelter for your wives and children and peace in your hearts. That's all I have to say about it, but I wish to say it with all the emphasis of which I am capable."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>There are a lot of us who wish we had acted on President Hinckley's counsel back in 1998. I heard a wise man comment that, when some of us hear stirring prophetic counsel, we react like we might at a Fourth of July fireworks display. We "ooh" and "ah" and applaud for a little while, then go back to our daily lives, largely unaffected by what we saw and heard. We ought to guard against the tendency to be too quick to forget admonitions we receive from modern prophets.&nbsp;<br /><br />It may be easy for some of us to follow the prophets on what we consider the big<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>issues, but what about patiently following on some issues that seem less earthshaking to us? Listen to this sobering insight from Elder Maxwell:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It is exceedingly important for members of the Church to get experience following the prophets in little things, so that they can follow in large matters. By following the prophets in fair weather we become familiar with their cadence, so that we can follow them in stormy times too, for then both our reflexes and our experience will need to combine to help us; the stresses will be so very real."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Returning thanks to God for whatsoever things ye do receive. This is an attribute I have watched my mother display throughout her life. She is always expressing thanks--to God, in her prayers, and to many others she feels have blessed and enriched her life. We kid her that she is the kind of person who sends a thank you note to someone who sent her a thank you note. She exemplifies the attitude mentioned in Alma 34:38 that we "live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you." In the Church we sing "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet." I hope that singing this stirring hymn at Conference time does not take the place of expressing regular gratitude in our personal and family prayers for the leadership and service of modern prophets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of us may impatiently wonder how frequently these men who lead the Church receive divine communication. President Hinckley related this story in answer to that question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Somebody asked Brother Widtsoe [a member of the Quorum of the Twelve] once . . 'How long has it been since we've had a revelation?' Brother Widtsoe replied, 'Oh, about last Thursday.' Now that's the way it goes. Each Thursday . . . the First Presidency and the Twelve meet in the temple, in those sacred hallowed precincts, and we pray together and discuss certain matters together, and the spirit of revelation comes upon those present. I know. I have seen it. I was there that June day in 1978 when President Kimball received revelation, surrounded by members of the Twelve, of whom I was one at the time."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From time to time, because of my responsibilities in the publishing department at Deseret Book, I have a chance to meet with one of the Brethren. Invariably, I feel buoyed up by these experiences. I come away feeling admiration for these men who have committed their whole lives to serving God and their fellow man. I come away feeling loved. I come away with an overriding impression that these are good, righteous men whose primary goal is to do what the Lord wants them to do. I am comforted and have a sense of assurance and peace through my interactions with these Church leaders. It is a sacred experience that is hard for me to adequately describe.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prophets are a Source of Direction and Light</strong></p>
<p>After the description of the terrible destruction that occurred on the American continent at the time of the Savior's crucifixion, we read what characteristic distinguished those who were spared--and this ought to be a sobering statement for us, who live in the latter days.&nbsp; "And it was the more righteous part of the people who were saved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them not. . . ."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I remember a talk Elder Monte J. Brough gave in a stake conference years ago in which he pointed out that nowadays we don't generally stone prophets, we just ignore them--but the end result for us can be the same. One of the great blessings of following the prophets is that there is safety in following them--always spiritual safety, but sometimes even physical safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is interesting how often in the scriptures the choice to follow divine counsel is associated with images of light. I love the passage in Psalms 119:105 which declares, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path."&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Elder John H. Groberg tells a story that powerfully teaches the importance of following the living prophet. While he was serving a mission in Tonga, he received word that a missionary was very ill on another island. The weather was threatening, but he felt responsible for the missionary's welfare, so he left and reached the island, despite heavy seas. They gave the ill missionary a blessing, during which the impression came to get the missionary back to the hospital on the main island.&nbsp;<br /><br />By this time, the weather had deteriorated to a small gale. The hour was late, and the sun was sinking rapidly. But the impression to return to the main island persisted. Some tried to persuade them not to go back--there was the darkness, the storm, and the formidable reef with its narrow opening to the harbor they would be attempting to reach. But soon eight people, including an experienced captain, boarded the boat. No sooner had they left than the intensity of the storm increased dramatically. There was no moon and Elder Groberg's spirits sank. As they approached the reef, all eyes vainly searched for the light that marked the opening to the harbor. Elder Groberg describes the experience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Then I heard the chilling sound of waves crashing and chewing against the reef! It was close--too close. Where was the light? Unless we entered the opening exactly, we would be smashed against the reef. . . . Our eyes strained against the blackness, but we could not see the light. Some began to whimper, . . . and one or two even to scream in hysteria. At the height of this panic, when others were pleading to turn to the left or to the right, . . . I looked at the captain--and there I saw the face of calmness, the ageless face of wisdom and experience, as his eyes penetrated the darkness ahead. Quietly, his weather-roughened lips parted, and without moving his fixed gaze and just perceptibly shifting the wheel, he breathed those life-giving words, "Ko e Maama a" ("There is the light!").</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I could not see the light, but the captain could see it, and I knew he could see it. Those eyes long experienced in ocean travel were not fooled by the madness of the storm, nor were they influenced by the pleadings of those of lesser experience to turn to the left or to the right. He calmly guided us forward. On one great swell, we were hurled through the opening and into calmer waters . . . [into] the protected harbor. . . . Then, and only then, did we see through the darkness that one small light--exactly where the captain had said it was. Had we waited until we ourselves could see the light, we would have been dashed to pieces. . . .&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"That night I learned this great lesson: there are those who, through years of experience and training and by virtue of special divine callings, can see further, better, and more clearly than we can. They can and will save us in situations where serious injury or death--both spiritual and physical--would be upon us before we ourselves could see clearly. . . . As we moved into that calm harbor . . . I thanked God . . . for that wonderful captain who saw the light in time. I thanked Him for our modern-day prophets whose eyes can see the light that will save us and the world. I thanked Him for the assurance that when all about us are sinking in darkness and fear and despair, when destruction seems close and the raging fury of men and demons ensnares us in seemingly insoluble problems, we can listen as the prophet calmly says, "There is the light. This is the way."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>If the captain in Elder Groberg's story is a symbol of the living prophets, how will we respond to the captain's direction? Will we be among those who are terrified and whimpering? Will we be critical of the prophets--telling Church leaders they should go a different direction? Or will we be calm--supporting the Brethren, praying for them, and doing whatever we can to show our support and our trust?&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, I bear witness that our latter-day prophets are called of God and speak for Him. I conclude with a promise given to those who give heed to the words and commandments of prophets, seers, and revelators:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.&nbsp; For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>In my opinion, that is one of the most remarkable promises in all of scripture. It's a glorious promise of safety and peace. Who among us would not want to claim that promise in the turbulent and confusing world in which we now live?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />May we receive the blessings, the safety, the light, the sure guidance and comfort that come from following the living prophets. It is my testimony, based on my experience and the witness of the Spirit to my soul, that our safety and happiness may depend in large measure on whether we tether ourselves securely to the living prophets and their counsel. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>General Authority Seventy</p>
<p>Elder Claudio D. Zivic was sustained as a General Authority Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on March 31, 2007. He served previously in the Fourth Quorum of the Seventy in the South America South Area and as a member of the South America South Area Presidency. He also served as an assistant executive director in the Temple Department and as a member of the Boundary and Leadership Change Committee. He is currently serving as a member of the Caribbean Area Presidency.<br /><br />Elder Zivic is a certified public accountant. He attended the University of Buenos Aires, graduating in 1973 with an accounting degree. For more than 10 years he worked as an executive for the Grimoldi Company, a shoe manufacturing and marketing firm. At the time of his call to full-time Church service, he was self-employed as an auditor and consultant.<br /><br />Elder Zivic has served in a number Church callings, including elders quorum president, institute teacher, counselor in a bishopric, bishop, stake high councilor, counselor in a stake presidency, temple ordinance worker, regional representative, Area Authority, and president of the Spain Bilbao Mission (2003-2006).<br /><br />Claudio Daniel Zivic was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on December 19, 1948. He married Dina Noem&iacute; Alvarez in January 1972. They are the parents of five children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My dear young people, and those not so young, what a great pleasure it is to be with you. Seeing your faces is an inspiration. As we greeted some of you, I was reminded of young people we have met in different parts of the world. Sometimes the surnames are the same. I remember that while I was president of the Spain Bilbao Mission, there was a missionary whose last name was Bateman; but he pronounced it Batman because that was easier for the Spaniards to pronounce. He was a zone leader; and I don't know why, but the mission president assigned him a companion named Robbins. It was very interesting for them, preaching the gospel on the streets of northern Spain, saying, "I am Batman and this is my companion, Robbins."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />What a beautiful place this is for those who have not yet found their eternal companions, having many young men and women here who are surely willing to start a family. Although, some of you may be of the opinion expressed by a great-grandfather who said to his great-grandson: "I came to this land (America) in search of freedom. It didn't do me much good. Your great-grandmother arrived on the next boat." In my case, I would respond to that comment with, "Long live slavery!" I am so grateful for my bondage to my wife.&nbsp;<br /><br />On March 5, 2011, my wife and I, our son, Damian, and his wife, Gabriela, and a friend traveled from Salt Lake City to the Manti Utah Temple. One of Damian's former missionary companions had asked me to perform his sealing. We had a map to show us how to get there. Because of carelessness we did not notice a small sign that indicated a detour on the way. After traveling for approximately an hour, we read the name of a city. Our son looked at the map and, very worried, he told us we had totally gone the wrong way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Very discouraged, desperate, and ashamed, I told my wife to call the temple president to tell him what had happened and have him assign another sealer to perform the marriage. After my wife had given him my message, President Ed J. Pinegar said the following, "We love you. Don't worry about the delay. We sustain you, we are with you, and we are going to wait for you." We arrived at the beautiful, historic Manti Temple and, in spite of the delay we were all able to rejoice in that very special event.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later, my wife made a very interesting comment. She said that hearing the words of President Pinegar, it was as if she had heard the voice of our Heavenly Father saying: "I love you, I sustain you, I am with you. Don't give up. Repent and persevere on the path I have shown you. That way, I promise you that we will see each other again in our heavenly home."&nbsp;<br /><br />I felt so badly for arriving late, but I thank my Heavenly Father, who inspired President Pinegar to say the words he said to us, especially to me, which caused me to persevere in spite of the difficulties in order to finally reach our objective. Being able to do so not only benefitted our lives but also those of other people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Some time ago I found a definition of the word persevere that I believe provides a better understanding than that provided by a dictionary. It goes like this: "To persevere means to maintain the ability to endure, to carry on, to continue in the same state without weakening or perishing. It is being able to go on in the face of pain, oppression, discouragement or suffering, without being defeated."&nbsp;<br /><br />What a beautiful and accurate definition! Jos&eacute; Ingenieros, the Italian-Argentine philosopher and writer, said: "Strong men are like kites: they rise up when the opposing winds are strongest." Remember that persevering in those things that matter usually requires constant effort. Over time, it will bear the fruits we long to obtain. If our path has no obstacles, our progress will be limited. Success has a price and there is no choice but to pay that price in order to obtain it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Calvin Coolidge, former president of this country, said: "Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent.&nbsp; Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated failures.&nbsp; Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'press on' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race."&nbsp;<br /><br />In the scriptures we have countless examples of perseverance. In the Old Testament we read of Joseph, the son of Jacob, also called Israel. This story is incomprehensible to me because of the attitude of his brothers. They hated him to the point of planning his death, although in the end they were kinder and sold him to the Ishmaelites who took him to Egypt as a slave. He was purchased by Potifar, captain of Pharaoh's guard, "And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand" (Genesis 39: 6).&nbsp;<br /><br />Later he was falsely accused of trying to abuse Potifar's wife and for that he was put in prison for at least three years. He remained captive for thirteen years and did not see his family for 22 years. Joseph's spiritual greatness was outstanding. After so many trials he would have been justified in giving up and saying, "What is the use of trying to serve God if my reward is only punishment?" But Joseph persevered in his faithfulness to God in spite of the great difficulties of his life. In the end, his perseverance bore wonderful fruits.&nbsp; His service blessed the lives of the Egyptians and the Hebrews and the progress and maturity he achieved were ample compensation for his suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the New Testament, we read of the Apostle Paul, one-time persecutor of the Christians and later a tireless disciple, he was brave and faithful in preaching the truth. He appeared before kings, bearing his testimony of the truthfulness of Jesus Christ. Sensing beforehand that his end was near, he wrote the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge shall give me at that day:&nbsp; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing" (2 Timothy 4:6-8).</p>
<p>Finally, he was taken as a prisoner to Rome where he was executed, probably in the spring of the year 65 AD. What a great example of perseverance even though he knew he would inevitably suffer a martyr's death. In The Book of Mormon, we are touched by the courage and perseverance of the prophet Abinadi as he testified of the truth even at the cost of his own life. "But I finish my message; and then it matters not whither I go, if it so be that I am saved" (Mosiah 13:9). &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The Prophet Joseph Smith is another wonderful example of perseverance. He said: "For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation" (Joseph Smith-History 1:25). While in Liberty Jail, and after much suffering, one of his companions asked him: "Joseph, how do we persevere?" His answer was "We trust in God and go on." He finally sealed his testimony with his own life, as did his brother Hyrum.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />These were all imperfect human beings living in a world of realities similar to ours. They were not fictional characters. Their perseverance on the right path is worthy of admiration and gratitude for the great example they gave us. The difference with today's demands is that we are not required to offer our lives as an example of perseverance. What is asked of us is that we be productive in the things that are pleasing to God--living to serve and persevering in things of eternal value.&nbsp;<br /><br />We have a five-year-old grandson named Facundo Andres Zivic. He told us about something very interesting that his kindergarten teacher does. When he behaves badly, she gives him a red card. When he behaves "so-so," she gives him a yellow card. If he behaves well, she gives him a green card. The child has to take these cards home so the parents know how he or she is behaving. When our grandson brings home a red card, he says it is because he plays a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As I was preparing this devotional, my grandson's experience came to my mind. I asked myself:&nbsp; What card do we deserve in our struggle to persevere in that which is and will be beneficial for us, for our family and for our fellowmen? A red card, a yellow card, or a green card? It would be worthwhile, for each of us, to conduct a self-analysis to find out which card we deserve right now. As we conduct this analysis, remember what Leo Tolstoy, the famous Russian novelist, said: "Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself."&nbsp;<br /><br />There are many scriptures about perseverance. We can gain very beneficial conclusions from each one of them. I will quote some. For example: "All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ" (Doctrine and Covenants 121:29). What great blessings we will be able to receive if we endure valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ! It does not only mean receiving material possessions, spaces in the universe. We are talking about spiritual possessions, having eternal families, eternal increase, eternal happiness.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In our book of remembrance, we have a photograph that was taken when my wife and I were in Primary. We were all there celebrating Christmas. This photo is very interesting because I am not looking to the front but to the side, right there towards that girl who in the future would be my wife. Even at a young age it would seem that I was interested in her. Looking at that photograph, some thoughts came to my mind. There were children who later left the Church, following paths that were very wrong. Today, one can clearly see the difference between those who persevered in the right path and those who went astray. One can testify of the beautiful fruits that can be obtained by living the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is no need to wait until after death to receive the rewards. We can enjoy them as we go through this earthly life, persevering on the right path.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world. And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father" (3 Nephi 27:16-17).</p>
<p>The Lord will hold us guiltless if we persevere in the process of repentance. The sinner who persists in sin, is sinking lower and lower in filthiness until Satan takes him for himself, causing irreparable and irreversible spiritual harm and also physical harm. If any of you have not confessed some serious sin, this is the time to do it. "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear..." (2 Timothy 1:7). Face the situation and resolve it in the Lord's way. King Benjamin explained the marvelous blessings we will receive if we continue faithful to the end.&nbsp; He said the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God.&nbsp; For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.&nbsp; O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it" (Mosiah 2:41).</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants 50:24: "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day."&nbsp;<br /><br />We have the responsibility of perfecting ourselves day by day. As we do so, our understanding increases, we feel more secure in facing responsibility. Sometimes we think that this progress will never come, but it will come. All that you are studying is of God. He wants us to "teach one another words of wisdom . . . out of the best books . . . seek[ing] learning, even by study and also by faith" (Doctrine and Covenants 88:118).&nbsp;<br /><br />I remember the day I began studying in the university. When I would hear students talking about the last courses they had to take in order to become certified public accountants, I looked at them with great reverence and respect. It seemed like a dream that I might be able to achieve that someday: to become a CPA.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several years before I graduated, I began working as an assistant to the controller of an important shoe company in Argentina. As I saw what the controller had to do, resolving all the accounting issues of the company, preparing the quarterly and general statements to present to the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, I said, "Of course I will keep studying, but I don't know if I will ever be able to take over the controller's job."&nbsp;<br /><br />At that time it seemed impossible that I would ever be able to take on that responsibility. What did happen was that when I graduated at age 25, they made me controller of the company and, at age 27, I was the administrative manager. I had that job for 11 years, until I retired to start my own accounting practice. The light of God enlightened me until I came to have the necessary capacity to take on those responsibilities. The same exact thing will happen with you. The preparation you are receiving will prepare you to take on challenges that are unthinkable right now.&nbsp;<br /><br />Throughout your lives, especially when you have to make major decisions, remember the following words from President Kimball:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"... greatness is not always a matter of the scale of one's life, but of the quality of one's life. True greatness is not always tied to the scope of our tasks, but to the quality of how we carry out our tasks whatever they are. In that attitude, let us give our time, ourselves, and our talents to the things that really matter now, things which will still matter a thousand years from now" ("A Gift of Gratitude,"&nbsp;<em>Liahona</em>, Dec.1977, 2).</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer said: "We want our children and their children to know that the choice of life is not between fame and obscurity, nor is the choice between wealth and poverty. The choice is between good and evil, and that is a very different matter indeed" ("The Choice,"&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1980).&nbsp;<br /><br />Be very careful in your professional lives. Do not have false gods before the Lord. Be wise. Do not let yourselves be carried away by the current of the world. Seek the Lord's inspiration and guidance to make wise decisions. Let the material things you earn be a blessing and not a curse in your lives and those of your families. How grateful I am that our Savior Jesus Christ endured to the end, fulfilling His mission of atoning for our sins. If He had not done so, our hope of returning to live with our Heavenly Father would be in vain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />He suffered for our sins, pains, depressions, anguish, infirmities, and fears so He knows how to help us, encourage us, comfort us, and give us strength to be able to persevere and obtain that crown that is reserved for those who are not defeated. Today we live our realities. Everyone has his time of trials, of happiness, decisions to make, obstacles to overcome, opportunities to capture.&nbsp; Remember that, as someone said, "The best way to predict the future is to create it."&nbsp;<br /><br />Generally the Olympic gold medals contain three words in Latin: Citius: faster, Altius: higher, Fortius: stronger. May we be the fastest, the highest, the strongest in order to continually break our own records in our quest to endure to the end. Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. This conviction goes beyond my feelings and human reasoning. It comes from the divine in a special way. The Prophet Joseph Smith was called by God to restore the gospel that Jesus Christ taught. President Thomas S. Monson is the prophet for all mankind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I leave you a blessing, as Alma said, "...may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon ...[your families] according to your faith and good works, from this time forth and forever" (Alma 7:27). I testify that, as I mentioned in the beginning, our Heavenly Father is constantly telling us, "I love you, I sustain you, I am with you. Do not give up. Repent and persevere in the path I have shown you. That way I promise you that we will see each other again in our heavenly home." In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Kevin L. Packard</strong></p>
<p><br />Thank you, brothers and sisters for being in attendance. I am grateful for the invitation to address you in this Thanksgiving-time devotional. I'm thankful to those who have provided the beautiful music, prayer, and scripture. President and Sister Clark have been so kind to me and my family over the years. I'm indebted for their sacrifice, love, and direction. I adore my eternal companion who sits at my side. She is virtuous and conducts herself with dignity. I am thankful for our children, parents, and siblings, for the gospel, and, most deeply, for the Redeemer. And I am thankful for the temple that I may more perfectly learn of Him. As you celebrate Thanksgiving, do not forget to express gratitude for these things. Despite living in "troubled times," (Monson, 2011) happiness and peace can be found in them.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the beginning, Adam and Eve were given commandments to love and serve God and make Him the only being they would worship. Whereas they fell, God gave to them His Only Begotten Son and added the instruction that they were to offer up sacrifices&nbsp;<em>in similitude</em>&nbsp;of His perfect sacrifice.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;These holy commandments are likewise extended to us. From them, two things are learned: first, we learn&nbsp;<strong><em>who</em></strong>&nbsp;is to be the object of our worship and second, we learn&nbsp;<strong><em>how</em></strong>&nbsp;to worship. Today, I will speak on worship. I invite the Spirit to attend us--to be our teacher and draw us closer to our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;<br /><br />Singling out<em>&nbsp;<strong>who</strong></em>&nbsp;is to be the object of our worship, Elder Bruce R. McConkie<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(1989) taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We worship the Father and him only and no one else. We do not worship the Son and we do not worship the Holy Ghost. I know perfectly well what the scriptures say about worshipping Christ and Jehovah, but they are speaking in an entirely different sense--the sense of standing in awe and being reverentially grateful to Him who has redeemed us. Worship in the true and saving sense is reserved for God the first, the Creator (p. 60).<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Concerning&nbsp;<strong><em>how</em></strong>&nbsp;to worship, we are instructed to offer up sacrifices<em>&nbsp;in similitude</em>&nbsp;of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten. Two words of this instruction--<em>in similitude--</em>are essential. They mean&nbsp;<em>in likeness of</em>, or&nbsp;<em>emulation</em>. "Perfect worship is emulation," Elder McConkie (1981) wrote. "We honor those whom we imitate. How do we worship the Lord," he added. "We do it by going from&nbsp;<em>grace to grace</em>, until we receive the fulness of the Father and are glorified in light and truth" (pp. 568-569).&nbsp;<br /><br />To the world,&nbsp;<em>grace</em>&nbsp;is viewed as withholding a just punishment or receiving a divine favor for which we've done nothing to merit. But the grace extended to Jesus, that increased Him from grace&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;grace, was neither of these as He was perfect. Rather, it was the enabling power (1982, p. 697) of His Father given as Jesus extended that grace to mankind. Please follow as I read selected passages from Section 93, carefully noting the unity and growth that was experienced in this giving and receiving of grace:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[T]he Father and I are one. ...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Father&nbsp;<em>because he gave me of his fulness</em>. ...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I was in the world and<em>&nbsp;received of my Father,&nbsp;</em>and the works of him were plainly manifest.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And I, John, saw that&nbsp;<em>he received not of the fulness at the first</em>, but&nbsp;<em>received grace&nbsp;<strong>for</strong>&nbsp;grace</em>;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And . . .<em>&nbsp;continued from grace&nbsp;<strong>to</strong>&nbsp;grace, until he received a fulness</em>.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Grace was received&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;grace that was given and, in this manner, the Son became as His Father is, and one with Him.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;It is, thereby, shown in this relationship that grace&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;grace forms an implied covenant between the&nbsp;<em>receiver&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>giver</em>&nbsp;of grace; Christ never sought for an enabling power except He honored the expectation to imitate His Father in extending that grace to His children. This sacred accord and pattern of worship is expressed in a commentary (2000) entitled<em>&nbsp;Revelations of the Restoration</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Savior increased in grace as he lived the commandments of God and blessed the lives of others. His growth was accelerated above that of his fellowmen because of the reciprocal nature of receiving strength of the Spirit when extending grace. That is, he called upon his Father for power and strength to bless others in their need. In answer to his prayers, he was empowered and grew beyond his previous abilities, thus, receiving grace&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;grace. Christ was foremost in reaching out in compassion to others. Therefore, he received greater grace from God in his efforts than any other person (pp. 672-673).</p>
<p>According to verse 19 of Section 93, this reciprocal pattern was recorded for us that we might know&nbsp;<strong><em>who</em></strong>&nbsp;we worship and&nbsp;<strong><em>how</em></strong>&nbsp;to worship.<sup>6</sup><em>W</em><strong><em>ho</em></strong>&nbsp;do we worship? God, the Father.&nbsp;<strong><em>How</em></strong>&nbsp;do we worship? By emulating Christ--the One who is like Him. In this regard, if there is a single characteristic that typifies the Savior's life, it is that He bore the burdens of others. He bore our temptations, afflictions, infirmities, sicknesses, pains, sins, sorrows, and the sting of our death.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;We most emulate Christ and, indeed, fulfill His law,<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;when we likewise bear the burdens of others and heal the wounds we did not inflict.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<strong><em>How</em></strong>&nbsp;do we worship? By receiving grace and giving grace "to undo the heavy burdens,"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;"to deal . . . [our] bread to the hungry,"<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;"to preach good tidings [to] the meek, . . . to comfort all that mourn,"<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;and to "draw out [our] soul . . . to satisfy the afflicted soul."<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />With worship in mind, I now turn to Alma 32. While you turn there, please note that Joseph Smith (1976) provided an explanation for interpreting the parables Jesus taught. "I have a key," he said, "by which I understand the scriptures. I enquire, what was the question that drew out the answer, or caused Jesus to utter the parable" (pp. 276-277)? Using this key, ask yourself, "What was the question that drew out Alma's sermon?" It was that certain individuals--cast out of their synagogues--came to him asserting that they could not worship.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Such was the matter placed before Alma that he then set forth to address. For this reason, Alma 32 is ultimately a sermon on worship, although often viewed as a lecture on faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />Most are familiar with this discourse in which Alma invited his proselytes to plant the gospel of Jesus Christ--the word<sup>15</sup>--in their heart. He afterwards described the results of doing so as an increase in faith and testimony. In his question and answer that follows in verse 31, please note that the central theme of his sermon was set forth. He asked, "And now, behold,&nbsp;<em>are ye sure that this is a good seed</em>?" He answered: "I say unto you,&nbsp;<em>Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness.</em>"<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In this declaration--that&nbsp;<em>every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness</em>--we are reminded of the&nbsp;<em>similitude</em>&nbsp;that must be present for worship to exist. Alma's message is that the gospel of Jesus Christ,&nbsp;<em>if emulated</em>, will bring forth unto its own likeness "unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;In harmony with this conclusion, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland (1997) teaches Alma's sermon with a single stroke of the pen. Please note his strict application of a lower and uppercase "w":</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Here the seed--the word of God--is moving toward full stature as the Word of God (p. 168).</em></p>
<p>Thus, the word develops into the Word. The first word is the seed and the last Word is the tree.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />With the understanding that worship engenders godliness, worship is where learning at this University must culminate, for it is life eternal to know God and Jesus Christ.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Thus, the pursuit of this knowledge must be the guiding principle of all our&nbsp;<em>learning by faith</em>. Importantly, this knowledge is not academically acquired. Rather, it is found in the enjoyment of God's attributes,<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;for, according to the apostle Peter, if "[His attributes] be in you and abound, [they] make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord, Jesus Christ."<sup>21</sup>We know God when we are like God--by "[seeing] as [we] are seen, and [knowing] as [we] are known."<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Because we are the offspring (Clark, 1970, p. 206) of Heavenly Parents who produce after their own kind,<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;their attributes are indigenous to our being. In mortality, these attributes begin in dormancy. Describing the process by which these attributes take life and shape, Elder Parley P. Pratt (1891) taught that the gift of the Holy Spirit adapts itself to all of these attributes and quickens and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use (p. 101).&nbsp;<br /><br />To this, I add two comments. First, God's attributes are not unfolded to us unless we ask. It is written in the LDS Bible Dictionary&nbsp;(1982) under the heading "Prayer" that "the object of prayer is . . . to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them" (p. 753). Hence, following the list of godly attributes set forth in Doctrine and Covenants 4, verse 6, the injunction is given: "<em>Ask, and ye shall receive</em>."<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Second, although received, God's attributes continue to remain latent until opened and used.<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Opening them comes by knocking;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;by launching all our physical and spiritual faculties to bear the burdens of others.<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;A life focused on bearing burdens we did not inflict is the grand finale of&nbsp;<em>learning by faith</em>; it is the essence of atonement. From this, it follows that&nbsp;<em>learning by faith</em><sup>28</sup>&nbsp;"is something found more naturally in service than in sequestered study. It is more the product of callused hands than of furrowed brow . . .. It is something that rests closer to the heart than to the intellect"&nbsp;(McConkie &amp; Ostler, 2000, pp. 676-677). It is found in receiving grace&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;grace.&nbsp;<br /><br />Returning to Alma 32, please consider verse 41 and the ingredients with which one is to nurture the word. They are 1) faith, 2) diligence, 3) patience, and 4) looking-forward. You might ask: Where is the emulation so crucial to worship? I respond: It is in faith, the first ingredient. This conclusion was illustrated by the apostle Paul. Please turn with me to Hebrews 11.&nbsp;<br /><br />After defining faith, the apostle Paul listed fourteen events accomplished by the patriarchs through the exercise of their faith. But stroking their egos was not Paul's intent. Rather, he designed to illustrate how, through their exercise of faith, an emulation of Christ resulted. Please watch the PowerPoint slides as I review two of the fourteen events; each of the remaining events can be similarly illustrated.<em>&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>First</em>, in verse 7, Paul wrote: "By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Do you see the emulation? By simply replacing Noah's name with that of Christ's and changing a few words, this verse illustrates that Noah emulated that which Christ was yet to do. By building an ark to the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, He emulated Christ's atonement and, thereby, worshipped God.<em>&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Second</em>, worship, born in the exercise of faith, is embodied in the story of Abraham and his son Isaac. Of this event, Jacob made special mention that it was&nbsp;<em>in similitude&nbsp;</em>of God and his Only Begotten Son<em>.</em><sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Thus, it is emulation at two levels. By faith and righteousness, Abraham received the assurance<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;that he would be the father of many nations.<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;He received the further assurance "that in Isaac shall thy seed be called."<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;These were the two certainties that would surely come to pass. Notwithstanding these promises, Abraham was commanded to take his son Isaac and offer him and the blessings as an offering unto God.&nbsp;<br /><br />With hope in Christ, Abraham took his son, laid him on the altar, and raised the instrument of death. His hope was not that God would step in to avert the tragedy. Rather, intent on slaying his son, Abraham proceeded on the&nbsp;<em>prevailing assurance</em>&nbsp;"that God was able to raise [Isaac] up, even from the dead."<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;The rest of the story you know. By faith, Abraham emulated the Father and Isaac emulated the Son in this hallmark expression of what it means to worship God through the exercise of faith.&nbsp;<br /><br />These examples give us reason to pause, and ask:&nbsp;<em>Should worship always be born in the exercise of our faith</em>? I respond, yes. If it's not, then the exercise of faith hasn't produced the fruit that causes us to become as God is. In sum, if we do not become like God, line upon line, in our&nbsp;<em>learning by faith</em>, then both our learning and faith is vain.<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Let us now focus on the root of worship. It is discovered in Alma's invitation, of which I am going to take liberty to revise: "Now, if ye give place, that [the Word] may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be [the true Word], if ye do not cast [Him] out by your unbelief,"<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;and then Alma described what this Word can do. This places Jesus Christ central in matters of worship. Without the True Pattern to emulate, worship cannot result. Remembering that the word develops into the Word causes the word to likewise take center stage.&nbsp;<br /><br />Comprising all that is written in scripture<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;and all that He shall ever say,<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;the word of God is called the&nbsp;<em>law of Christ</em>, or&nbsp;<em>law of the gospel</em>. Because it embraces the power of an endless life,<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;it is a pearl of great price for which we must be willing to sell all that we have to possess.<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;Owing to this worth, the Lord reproved the church for having&nbsp;<em>treated it lightly.</em><sup>41</sup>&nbsp;Importantly, it is this law with which we are to be purified through the atonement if we are to receive a celestial glory,<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;for the Lord has said that they who are not sanctified&nbsp;<em>through the law of Christ</em>&nbsp;must inherit another kingdom.<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;But knowledge of this law will not, alone, suffice. It is by obedience<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;to this law&nbsp;<em>through</em>&nbsp;which the atonement cleanses us.<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;President Harold B. Lee (1996) taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You may ask me, how does one sanctify himself, and make himself holy so that he is prepared to walk in the presence of the Lord? . . . The Lord says this, 'And again, verily I say unto you,&nbsp;<em>that which is governed by law is also preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same</em>' (D&amp;C 88:34). What law? The laws of the Lord as contained in the gospel of Jesus Christ,&nbsp;<em>the keeping of which laws and ordinances are the ways by which we are purified and made holy</em>&nbsp;(p. 27).</p>
<p>All of this is simplified into our third Article of Faith: "We believe that through the atonement of Jesus Christ, all mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel."&nbsp;<br /><br />The connection between being&nbsp;<em>governed</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>washed</em>&nbsp;by the word of God is beautifully illustrated in Ezekiel 47. Therein, Ezekiel is taken to the temple from whence the pure and living waters flow. In verses 3 through 5, he is brought&nbsp;<em>through</em>&nbsp;the waters not once, but four times. With each passing&nbsp;<em>through</em>, the waters grew progressively deeper--to the ankles, the knees, and the loins, thus, symbolizing an increased submission to the water's flow&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;an equivalent cleansing. When at last, the "waters were risen" and became "waters to swim in, [and] a river that could not be passed over,"<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;it is clear that Ezekiel was altogether&nbsp;<em>governed</em>&nbsp;by the waters; insomuch that he allowed himself to be taken whithersoever those pure waters flowed. And through that governance by law--never separating his self from the atonement--he was preserved, perfected, and sanctified by the same.&nbsp;<br /><br />I now echo a warning given by the apostle Paul concerning the word of God as it relates to worship. The apostle Paul wrote of a peril<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;that would exist in these last days. Adding emphasis to Paul's warning, President Howard W. Hunter (1993) declared that "all dispensations have had their perilous times, but our day will include genuine peril"&nbsp;(p. 70).<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;It is subtle, but the peril is this: In his pursuit to destroy true worship, Satan gives careful attention to muddying the pure waters that flow from the House of the Lord, for even he knows that "every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness." With intent to mislead, he pollutes the pure wine of the gospel with the philosophies of men<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;that the seed, from which true worship grows, might be spoiled, for he also knows that a corrupt seed cannot bring forth good fruit.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was with this peril in mind that Paul penned his second letter to Timothy foretelling of a time when man would be "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"<sup>50</sup>--</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For the time will come when&nbsp;<em>they will not endure sound doctrine</em>; but after their own lusts shall they&nbsp;<em>heap to themselves teachers</em>, having itching ears;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And they&nbsp;<em>shall turn away their ears from the truth</em>, and shall&nbsp;<em>be turned unto fables</em>.<sup>51</sup></p>
<p>These verses most surely pertain to us, for Paul's final warning that "we would not endure sound doctrine" alludes to an earlier event of which Paul said was recorded "for an admonition for those upon whom the end of the world shall come."<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Concerning this event, when the children of Israel left Egypt, they did so in haste. One month following their departure, the assembly cried out in hunger. To Moses, the Lord responded: "Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and&nbsp;<em>the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day,</em>&nbsp;<em>that I may prove them</em>."<sup>53</sup>&nbsp;Although written that this was angels' food,<sup>54</sup>&nbsp;manna tasted like fresh oil.<sup>55</sup>&nbsp;Thus, the congregation often scorned the&nbsp;<em>light bread</em>.<sup>56</sup>&nbsp;During one perilous incident, the mixt multitude cried:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Why came we forth out of Egypt?<sup>57</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Who shall give us flesh to eat?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We remember the fish . . . the cucumbers, and the melons . . ..</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But now our soul [is] dried away: [there is] nothing at all, beside this manna, [before] our eyes.<sup>58</sup></p>
<p>In retribution for their scorn of this "bread from heaven"--an emblem of the word and of Christ as the "bread of life"<sup>59</sup>--the Lord "brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this [either] side . . . round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth." Eager to partake of this flesh, the congregation gathered the quails, and he that gathered least gathered ten homers.<sup>60</sup>&nbsp;Understanding that a single homer is equivalent to 6&frac12; bushel produces a rather ghastly perspective from this unchecked lusting after flesh. Hence, while the flesh was yet between their teeth, "the Lord smote the people with a very great plague," and many perished. And, in simplified English, they called the place where they buried the dead, "<em>the graveyard of those who lusted</em>."<sup>61</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Just as ancient Israel did not endure the light bread but&nbsp;<em>heaped to</em>&nbsp;themselves flesh, Paul declared that saints of the last days would not endure sound doctrine--the bread of heaven--but instead heap to themselves teachers, like--and I quote--"Sigmund Freud, Charles Darwin, John Dewey, Karl Marx, and John Maynard Keynes,"<sup>62</sup>&nbsp;espousing perilous ideals. Although latter-day prophets have warned us about these individuals, the number that can be added to them espousing perilous "isms" of every kind is truly heaping. Because of them, Nephi wrote, all have "gone astray save it be a few, who are the humble followers of Christ; nevertheless,&nbsp;<em>they are led</em>, that in many instances&nbsp;<em>they do err because they are taught by the precepts of men</em>."<sup>63</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Please observe that even the humble followers of Jesus Christ do often err because they are taught by the precepts of men.<sup>64</sup>&nbsp;Great caution, then, must be exercised with respect to the precepts of men, wherever and whenever they are taught.<sup>65</sup>&nbsp;Gratefully, Nephi provided the litmus test by which we can, through the spirit of discernment, measure the truthfulness of all that is taught: "Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man," he wrote, "or maketh flesh his arm, or shall hearken unto the precepts of men,&nbsp;<em>save their precepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost</em>."<sup>66</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Based on the foregoing, I have five invitations for you this afternoon. First, treasure up God's word by studying the scriptures every day. Never tire of "feasting upon"<sup>67</sup>&nbsp;this light bread that tastes like oil. These words "will tell you all things what ye should do."<sup>68</sup>&nbsp;I have found, as supported by scriptural patterns, that early study is best. Let it begin with prayer and the invitation to be taught, and let it continue for sufficient time to be taught of the Lord.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second,&nbsp;<em>add</em>&nbsp;to the word your complete obedience and frequent attendance to the temple from where the pure waters flow, that you may learn to swim in clean waters, unsullied by the philosophies of men, and be cleansed through the atonement of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />Third, after you leave that sacred house, apply the litmus test that Nephi gave--to examine all that is spoken, wherever spoken, and reject as fables the precepts of men save those which have been given by the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fourth, look around you and seek to find those in need. Ask for grace that you might extend grace in easing their burdens. As the Father was in His Son, so the Son is to be in us.<sup>69</sup>&nbsp;The world is to see Him through us<sup>70</sup>--in our words, deeds, thoughts, and love; in the fullness of His attributes and character.&nbsp;<br /><br />And finally, I invite you to offer a sacrifice in similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son that you might be found worshipping. That sacrifice is set forth in Matthew 26 as the giving of your will to God.<sup>71</sup>&nbsp;That is the only sacrifice which is in&nbsp;<em>similitude</em>&nbsp;of His offering. It is the truest and most faithful form of worship.<sup>72</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />I bear testimony of Jesus Christ, that He is coming to cleanse this earth. Oh how I desire that day to come, that He may reign over us and wipe away all tears.<sup>73</sup>&nbsp;All who are pure--even as He is pure--shall abide that day; whether in life or in death.<sup>74</sup>&nbsp;I bear testimony that all the positive changes we make in life are made possible through His supreme and infinite atonement. I am grateful to Heavenly Father for the wonderful gift of His Son.<sup>75</sup>&nbsp;May we have the desire to receive all that is offered through His atonement and His endless and powerful word. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Works Cited</strong><strong><br /></strong>Bednar, D. A.

For this, I do not apologize.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Compare Isaiah 30:9-10 and 6:10. Elder McConkie (1971) spoke rather absurdly: "If a man worships a cow or a crocodile, he can gain any reward that cows and crocodiles happen to be passing out this season." But if a man desires to have the Spirit poured out upon him and possess "power to raise the dead, move mountains, entertain angels, and walk in celestial streets," he continued, "he must worship the true and living God, in spirit and in truth."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;D&amp;C 93:3-5, 12-13; emphasis added.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Because grace is given for the benefit of others, it was always suited to others' individual needs. It can be restated that "Christ sought earnestly the best gifts always remembering for what they were given, for they are "given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh to do so" (see D&amp;C 46:8-9).<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>Instructing us on this verse, President Harold B. Lee (1996) noted: "These words make it increasingly clear why it is 'life eternal to know God and Jesus Christ' (see John 17:3). One must understand the divine nature and the attributes of the God whom he would worship. By understanding how the Son gained the fulness of the glory of the Father by continuing from grace to grace, we as mortals are given the true pattern as to&nbsp;<strong><em>how</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>by an emulation of Him&nbsp;<strong>who</strong>m we worship</em>&nbsp;we, too, might come unto the Father and receive of his fulness and be glorified in the Son even as the Son is glorified in the Father" (p. 2).<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;See Alma 7:11-13.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;See Galatians 6:2.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Elder McConkie (1971) summarized worship: "It is ten thousand times ten thousand things. It is keeping the commandments of God. It is living the whole law of the whole gospel. To worship the Lord is to be like Christ until we receive from him the blessed assurance: 'Ye shall be even as I am.'"<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;See Isaiah 58:6.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;See Isaiah 58:7.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;See Isaiah 61:1-2.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;See Isaiah 58:10.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;See Alma 32:2-3, 5.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;The precise definition that Alma gives of the "word" is "that [Christ] will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works" (see Alma 33:22).<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Alma 32:31.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Ephesians 4:13. JST John 1:1-16 teaches this precise concept with respect to Christ's own pre-mortal progression.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;See Isaiah 61:1-3 wherein the Lord refers to His saints as "trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD."<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;See D&amp;C 132:22-24.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;The precise list of godly attributes is included in scriptures three times: 2 Peter 1:5-8, D&amp;C 4:6, and D&amp;C 107:3.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;See 2 Peter 1:8.<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;See D&amp;C 76:94; compare 1 John 3:2 and Moroni 7:48.<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;See Acts 2:28-29. Official Statements of the Church on the origin of man entitled&nbsp;<em>The Origin of Man</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Mormon View of Evolution</em>&nbsp;were published by the First Presidency in 1909 and 1925, respectively (see&nbsp;<em>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</em>, 1-4 vols., edited by Daniel H. Ludlow (New York: Macmillan, 1992), Appendix 4, pp. 1665-1670). Notwithstanding my personal support of the declarations made in these Official Statements, the following summary by William E. Evanson in&nbsp;<em>Encyclopedia</em>&nbsp;provides a proper perspective on where we should focus our gospel conversations: "In 1931, when there was intense discussion on the issue of organic evolution, the First Presidency of the Church, then consisting of Presidents Heber J. Grant, Anthony W. Ivins, and Charles W. Nibley, addressed all of the General Authorities of the Church on the matter, and concluded, 'Upon the fundamental doctrines of the Church we are all agreed. Our mission is to bear the message of the restored gospel to the world. Leave geology, biology, archaeology, and anthropology, no one of which has to do with the salvation of the souls of mankind, to scientific research, while we magnify our calling in the realm of the Church . . . Upon one thing we should all be able to agree, namely, that Presidents Joseph F. Smith, John R. Winder, and Anthon H. Lund were right when they said: 'Adam is the primal parent of our race' [First Presidency Minutes, Apr. 7, 1931]" (see Evolution, p. 478).<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;See D&amp;C 4:7; italics added.<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;See D&amp;C 88:32-33.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;See D&amp;C 4:7.<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;This act of bearing another's burdens is one of the reasons why temple work was referred to by President Gordon B. Hinckley as the highest form of our worship. It is a type and shadow of the Lord's own atonement. It is emulation of the highest form. In temples, we perform a vicarious work that our progenitors cannot do and we carry a burden which they cannot remove and, by so doing, we open the doors of salvation to them.<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Learning by faith is the equivalent of learning by revelation. Elder Dallin H. Oaks (1991) notes: "Seeking learning by study, we use the method of reason. Seeking learning by faith, we must rely on revelation. Obedient to heavenly decree, we should seek learning by reason and also by revelation" (p. 16).<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Hebrews 11:7.<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;See Jacob 4:5.<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;The scriptures teach that he received all things by revelation and commandment by God's word (see D&amp;C 132:29).<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;See Genesis 17.<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;See Hebrews 11:18.<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;See Hebrews 11:19.<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;Paul's verses suggest that when it comes to the exercise of our faith, it is insufficient to wonder what Jesus would do in any particular situation--there is no room for personal opinion. Rather, we must study the Savior's life diligently, come to know precisely who He is and what He did, develop an understanding of His attributes, and then emulate Him precisely.<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;See Alma 32:28.<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;See D&amp;C 42:59.<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;See D&amp;C 84:43-44.<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;See JST John 1:18; compare Hebrews 7:16.<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;See JST Matthew 13:47.<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;See D&amp;C 84:54-55. We have likewise been warned to "beware how [we] hold [these words], for they are to be answered upon [our] souls in the Day of Judgment" (D&amp;C 41:12). These words are given to the salvation of [the Lord's] own&nbsp;<strong><em>elect</em></strong>" (see D&amp;C 35:20), they who&nbsp;<strong><em>treasure up</em></strong>His word (see JS--Matthew 1:37)&nbsp;<strong><em>hear</em></strong>&nbsp;his word, (see D&amp;C 29:7) and&nbsp;<strong><em>hearken</em></strong>&nbsp;to His word (see D&amp;C 33:6).<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;If one desires to truly understand the significance of the law of the gospel to this dispensation, a thorough study of the feasts of trumpets is suggested.<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;See D&amp;C 88:21. Thus, did Christ pray for His apostles that they would be&nbsp;<em>sanctified through the word</em>&nbsp;(see John 17:17-19).<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;Elder Bruce R. McConkie (1983) confirmed that "[s]anctification comes&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;to the obedient;&nbsp;<em>it is the truth of heaven--the very word of God . . . which sanctifies the souls of men (p. 114).</em>&nbsp;Compare D&amp;C 76:52.<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;See 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;Article of Faith; compare D&amp;C 130:20-21. President Heber J. Grant (2002) taught: "There is but one path of safety for the Latter-day Saints, and that is the path of duty. It is not a testimony only; it is not marvelous manifestations; it is not knowing that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true, that it is the plan of salvation--it is not actually knowing that the Savior is the Redeemer, and that Joseph Smith was his prophet, that will save you and me; but it is the keeping of the commandments of God, living the life of a Latter-day Saint" (p. 31).<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;See Ezekiel 47:1-5.<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;2 Timothy 3:1.<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;Asserting that we live in those times, Elder Packer (2004) recently noted that the dangers itemized by Paul are a description "of the days in which we live" (pp. 4-5).<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;See McConkie (1982), p.59. Jeremiah wrote that even sea monsters draw out the breast to give suck to the children of Israel (see Lamentation 4:3).<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;See 2 Timothy 3:7.<sup>51</sup>&nbsp;2 Timothy 4:3-4; emphasis added.<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;See JST 1 Corinthians 10:11.<sup>53</sup>&nbsp;Exodus 16:4.<sup>54</sup>&nbsp;See Psalms 78:25. Verses 23-35 of this psalm are enlightening.<sup>55</sup>&nbsp;Numbers 11:7-8.<sup>56</sup>&nbsp;See Numbers 21:5.<sup>57</sup>&nbsp;Numbers 11:20.<sup>58</sup>&nbsp;Numbers 11:4-6.<sup>59</sup>&nbsp;See John 6:31-35, 51-58.<sup>60</sup>&nbsp;See Numbers 11:31-32.<sup>61</sup>&nbsp;See Numbers 11:33-34, including footnote 34a. King David wrote that the fattest were slain of the plague (see Psalms 78:31).<sup>62</sup>&nbsp;These five philosophers are named by Elder Ezra Taft Benson (1970, p. 22) in his&nbsp;<em>General Conference</em>&nbsp;address given in October 1970 as individuals who belong to the heap of teachers with itching ears. They are again mentioned in his book,&nbsp;<em>Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson</em>&nbsp;(1988, p. 307), a work that was printed after being personally reviewed by the entire First Presidency, which included Presidents Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson, as counselors. Concerning this process of review, the introduction to&nbsp;<em>Teachings</em>&nbsp;includes: "The excerpts that make up this teachings volume have come from [Ezra Taft Benson's] speeches or public writings after he was called to the apostleship and sustained as a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator.&nbsp; President Benson personally reviewed the entire manuscript, as did his counselors in the First Presidency"&nbsp;(p. vii).<sup>63</sup>&nbsp;See 2 Nephi 28:14.<sup>64</sup>&nbsp;Concerning this very thing, Elder McConkie (1982) wrote: "Even in the true Church in the last days there will be some who do not believe the whole body of revealed truth; some who do not give full allegiance to the Cause of truth and righteousness; some who are members in name only and who continue to live after the manner of the world. This also is one of the signs of the times. It shall be as it was among some of old whom Paul rebuked: 'When ye come together in the church,' he wrote to the Corinthians, 'there be divisions among you.' Contention, debate, and false views have no place in the Church and kingdom of our Lord. The doctrines are his, not ours, and our concern should be to gain the mind of Christ and to think what he thinks on every point. But the fact is that there are divisions in the Church, for the very reason Paul now gives: 'There must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you' (1 Cor. 11:18-19)" (p. 59).<sup>65</sup>&nbsp;President Ezra Taft Benson (1988) taught: "We encourage you to get your . . . degrees and to further your education; but let us not forget that disaffection from the gospel and the Lord's church was brought about in the past by the attempts to reconcile the pure gospel with the secular philosophies of men . . . Be careful of blending your worldly training with the gospel courses you teach lest you be guilty of diluting the pure gospel of Jesus Christ and end up teaching the philosophy of men mingled with a few scriptures" (p. 308).<sup>66</sup>&nbsp;2 Nephi 28:31; emphasis added.<sup>67</sup>&nbsp;See 2 Nephi 31:20.<sup>68</sup>&nbsp;See 2 Nephi 32:3. And Christ's example--the way--will "show unto you all things what ye should do" (see 2 Nephi 32:5).<sup>69</sup>&nbsp;The idea that God dwells in our heart is an old sectarian notion, and is false (see D&amp;C 130:3). The enjoyment of God's attributes is to dwell in God. "To possess the principles which God possesses is to dwell in God," wrote Elder McConkie (1965 - 1973). Continuing, He wrote: "That is, if we possess love, charity, faith, and every godly attribute as he possesses them, then he dwells in us because we have received those attributes which come from him, and we dwell in him because we have become as he is" (p. 401). Compare D&amp;C 50:40.<sup>70</sup>&nbsp;See 3 Nephi 18:24.<sup>71</sup>&nbsp;See Matthew 26:36, 39, and 41.<sup>72</sup>&nbsp;See D&amp;C 97:8. This sacrifice not only brings sanctification, but freedom as well. President Boyd K. Packer (1982) has taught that "[o]bedience to God can be the very highest expression of independence. Just think of giving to him the one thing, the one gift that he would never take . . . . Obedience--that which God will never take by force--he will accept when freely given. And he will then return to you freedom that you can hardly dream of" (p. 256).<sup>73</sup>&nbsp;See Revelation 21:4-5.<sup>74</sup>&nbsp;D&amp;C 61:39.<sup>75</sup>&nbsp;See John 3:16; compare 1 Nephi 11:18-22.</p>

<p>How many of you (you don't have to raise your hands) have had a moment of impatience today? Were you impatient with time, with another person, or with yourself? A combination of all three? Each of us has ample opportunity each day to struggle with impatience. So let's talk about it.<br /><br />Impatience is always in a hurry to get things done. Impatience doesn't like to take time with details. Impatience wants to excel at things on the first try. Impatience wants others to work smoothly into its plans-it doesn't want to have to make changes or tolerate others quirks or inadequacies. Impatience wants what it wants NOW, without having to wait.&nbsp; Impatience is spoiled and egocentric.<br /><br />Patience, on the other hand, is key to developing a Christ-like nature. Today I'd like to share with you what I've learned about patience, using two key talks-- a classic talk by Elder Neal A. Maxwell, titled "Patience," and a recent conference address by President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "Continue in Patience." Building on insights from President Uchtdorf and Elder Maxwell, I'd like to use the following definition of patience for the rest of this talk.&nbsp;<br /><br />Patience is a way of demonstrating faith in God by:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Putting our desires on hold and submitting to his timing<br />Sustaining our obedience when results are not immediate or obvious<br />Allowing others to exercise their agency in order to progress</p>
<p><strong>PUTTING OUR DESIRES ON HOLD AND SUBMITTING TO HIS TIMING</strong><br /><br />In the article "Tommy and the Gumball Machine," Jean Ashby tells the story of her son, Tommy. Her little boy was following her into a store and was allowed a penny to get a gumball out of a machine. His mother continued into the store to get a cart, and the automatic door closed behind her. When Tommy struggled to turn the handle on the gumball machine, he became distressed. His mother noticed, but couldn't get back through the automatic doors. She indicated that he should take a step towards her, so the doors would open, but he clung to the gumball machine, afraid he wouldn't get his treasured gumball if he stepped away from it.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />It seems like some of us are like Tommy by the gumball machine. We feel that God has deprived us of something we really want, when he might actually ask us to step away from it for a time so that he can reward us with it at a later time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When I was at Ricks College, I worked part time and lived at home so that I could save money to go on a study abroad at the Jerusalem Center in Israel. I worked for years to save up enough money to go on this trip, depriving myself of a lot of things and opportunities that I would otherwise have enjoyed. Finally, the time came...I was accepted to the program and ready to go. Unfortunately, the first Gulf War began on the day we were to have left, in January 1991. I was devastated. I had looked forward to this for years, and now it felt like all of my hard work was for nothing. But things took an interesting turn. Although going to Israel was my main goal, I also had dreams of traveling through Europe and seeing many of the famous cultural sights of the world.&nbsp; As weeks passed by, they said that I could attend Fall semester in Israel, which was less expensive and left me with enough money to also go to Europe on a tour with the Humanities department at Ricks College. Like Tommy by the gumball machine, it had seemed like I was being deprived of something I really wanted, when later I got that plus so much more.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not implying that going on a trip is a matter of eternal importance, but this experience began to teach me about accepting changes in my plans. I experienced something similar later in my life. After graduating from Utah State University, I obtained my first teaching job. My first year was extremely difficult, but after a few years I was enjoying my job and my students. I began to feel impressions that I should return to school for a Master's degree. I resisted these impressions. I explained to Heavenly Father that graduate school wasn't really necessary since what I wanted was to get married. Why take the time and money to get another degree when I was perfectly happy to wrap up my career and get married? Like Tommy, all I could hear was "you aren't going to get your gumball."&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, finally I stepped away from the gumball machine and returned to school and the moment classes began, I knew I was where I needed to be. Now I'm here a BYU-Idaho, something I could not have done without an advanced degree, and I'm working on my PhD at Idaho State University. This is not the life I planned for myself, but it is a deeply rewarding life that has brought me a lot of happiness.When God asks us to step away from the gumball machine it is often to give us other blessings...things that he knows will make us happy and help us to grow. It is detrimental to refuse to move simply because he's not giving us what we want right now. Please think of that as you are faced with similar challenges... a relationship that doesn't turn out the way you want it to, feeling that you might need to change majors, not getting your dream job immediately out of college, or not having kids on the timeline that you had for yourself.Elder Maxwell wisely says, "Patience is tied very closely to our faith in our Heavenly Father. Actually, when we are unduly impatient, we are suggesting that we know what is best-better than does God. Or, at least, we are asserting that our timetable is better than his. Either way, we are questioning the reality of God's omniscience."<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>SUSTAINING OUR OBEDIENCE WHEN RESULTS ARE NOT IMMEDIATE OR OBVIOUS</strong><br /><br />While obedience may seem simple enough, sustained obedience can be a challenge. As Elder Maxwell says, "Sometimes what we are doing is correct enough but simply needs to be persisted in-patiently-not for a minute or a moment but sometimes for years."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Persisting like he suggests might cause our enthusiasm to lag because it seems that nothing is happening.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Brother of Jared and his fellow travelers were led miraculously to the sea only to wait there for four years. From the record we have, it seems that the brother of Jared stopped praying as fervently or maybe completely. Keep in mind that this is a man that everyone went to because he seemed to have such a direct connection with God. People had faith in his prayers. And he stopped praying. In fact, God "talked with him for the space of three hours," and "chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord."<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;From this you can see that sometimes it's hard to sustain our obedience and enthusiasm when it seems like there are no results.&nbsp;<br /><br />So what should our attitude be during these times? Elder Maxwell says, "The seeming flat periods of life give us a blessed chance to reflect upon what is past as well as to be readied for some rather stirring climbs ahead. Instead of grumbling and murmuring, we should be consolidating and reflecting, which would not happen if life were an uninterrupted sequence of fantastic scenery...Patience helps us use rather than protest the seeming flat periods of life, becoming filled with quiet wonder over the past and with anticipation for that which may lie ahead."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, a friend of mine married later in life-age 39. She had dated and had several relationships that didn't work out. Some of her friends who were also older and single chose to date people who were not members and to stop living according to church standards.&nbsp; Perhaps they felt that since they weren't being blessed with a husband, there was no point to living the law of chastity and other church standards.&nbsp;<br /><br />Wendy stayed faithful. She had a successful career as an interior decorator and realtor, she served as the Relief Society president in her home ward, she was an active influence in the lives of her nieces and nephews, and she revitalized the singles program in her stake and region. At age 39 she married a wonderful man and became a step-mother to three young boys. Had she not used those decades where it seemed "nothing" was happening in her life, she would not have been prepared for the immediate demands of motherhood. She said of this waiting period, "I think probably the greatest thing about getting married later was learning how to truly rely on the Lord and realizing that I am not alone in any struggle that I have. If I had married earlier I would have relied on husband and family and maybe less on the Lord. Learning to rely on the Lord prepared me for being a mom a little bit better. Having to wait for marriage makes me appreciate what I have more. You go into marriage really wanting to make things work."&nbsp;<br /><br />All of us will have flat periods in our life, where it seems that nothing is happening. It might even feel like God has forgotten us. What will we do during this time? Will we dig deep for the resolve to stay obedient and faithful, taking the opportunities that are given us, or will we become lax and disobedient and feel sorry for ourselves?&nbsp;<br /><br />Some things in our lives happen on a schedule--birth, baptism, receiving the priesthood, serving a mission. Others happen in their own time (although we may feel that everyone else is doing them at a specific time). Elder Dallin H. Oaks has said, "Because of things over which we have no control, we cannot plan and bring to pass everything we desire in our lives. Many important things will occur in our lives that we have not planned, and not all of them will be welcome. Even our most righteous desires may elude us or come in different ways or at different times than we have sought to plan."<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Who knows why we don't get everything we want when we want it. Maybe the obvious reason is that God is testing us. Life is a test.&nbsp; Elder Maxwell reminds us, "God simultaneously tries the patience of his people even as he tries their faith."<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But even as he tests us, he blesses us abundantly. I personally feel humbled when I realize that although God isn't giving me everything I want, when I want it, He is pouring out other blessings on me, as he does on all of us, if we take the time to notice.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another task that requires sustained obedience is trying to overcome our weaknesses. At times we might feel tired of struggling with the same things every day. &nbsp;In our recent conference, President Uchtdorf said, "God wants to help us to eventually turn all of our weaknesses into strengths, but He knows that this is a long-term goal. He wants us to become perfect, and if we stay on the path of discipleship, one day we will. It's OK that you're not quite there yet. Keep working on it, but stop punishing yourself."<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;He also said, "I want to tell you something that I hope you will take in the right way: God is fully aware that you and I are not perfect. Let me add: God is also fully aware that the people you think are perfect are not."<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Like many of you, when I was growing up I tended to devote my time to things that I naturally excelled at. &nbsp;But I learned something valuable when I chose to devote some time to something that I'm not naturally good at.&nbsp; A few years ago, I decided to train for a marathon. I have never been a regular runner...in fact, I was pretty vocal about the fact that running was torture to me. In spite of these feelings, I decided to overcome my fears and train for a marathon.&nbsp;<br /><br />While I never ran fast, and definitely didn't break any records, (You know the people at the very, very end of a race? Well, I was just ahead of them.) I learned that running a marathon is all about time and patience and just putting one foot in front of the other. That's the essential decision that I had to make...keep going, one step at a time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Changing things about ourselves is basically the same. One foot in front of the other, day after day. This takes a lot of patience. I have a calendar on the wall in my bathroom that I see every day while I'm getting ready for work. This is where I track my progress on habits I'm trying to either get rid of or obtain. I've noticed that as I track my progress, I get a better sense of how I'm doing on making these changes. Sometimes, it's frustrating and I am discouraged with my lack of progress. I wonder why I can't just decide to do or not do something and be done with it.&nbsp;<br /><br />But I also know that my willpower can only take me so far. After I've expended my best efforts, there is still usually a significant gap between what I can achieve and what I want to be.&nbsp; This is when grace steps in, which, according to the Bible Dictionary is "divine means of...strength and assistance to do good works that we otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to our own means."<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;In some cases, only earnest fasting and prayer will make the difference in helping us obtain a quality or make a needed change in our lives, but I testify that it will happen, even when we've struggled for years to make a specific change.&nbsp;<br /><br />In an&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>&nbsp;article from 1981, Dennis R. Peterson shared the process he used to overcome some of his weaknesses. He realized that the key to changing his behavior was to learn to love the things that God loves...to feel the way God does about different issues. He decided to try this as he overcame his lack of desire to go to church. He says:&nbsp;<br /><br />"Cautiously, I chose my first target. It wasn't very earthshaking, but it was a persistent problem. I didn't enjoy attending church. So, morning and night, I would pray: "Lord, bless me to feel about our worship services just the way thou dost. Help me to find in them the things that thou wouldst find. Help me to participate in the ways that thou wouldst." And tremendous things began to happen. Sunday became a day filled with light; I found myself hungry to greet the other members of the Church, to share my testimony with them, to learn from the teachers, to express in song the feelings I had no words for, and to partake of the emblems of our Savior's sacrifice with humility and gratitude. Sunday became a Sabbath. No longer was attending church a matter of suppressing my desire to rest, read, study, ski, or play. Now it was an expression of righteous, loving desires."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;He later used this same process to overcome angry feelings towards a co-worker.&nbsp;<br /><br />Making these types of changes takes patience.&nbsp; It means starting over every day and trying to do better than you did yesterday. This can be frustrating. It's easier to just say, "This is who I am and I can't change" but such an attitude ignores the power of the atonement. The whole purpose of our earth life is to learn from our experiences. To lazily defend our weaknesses because it's too difficult to change is to ignore the tremendous weight the Savior has already borne for us in the hopes that we will make the atonement an active tool for change in our lives.&nbsp; Let's not ignore that gift.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>ALLOWING OTHERS TO EXERCISE THEIR AGENCY IN ORDER TO PROGRESS</strong><br /><br />Doesn't it sometimes seem that other people are only on earth to make our lives miserable? Perhaps it's a family member, a roommate, a coworker, a teacher (or a student), a neighbor, or friend. Sometimes it seems easier just to avoid difficult people as much as possible. I don't believe that is what Heavenly Father has in mind.&nbsp;<br /><br />When you cut into an onion, you see many different layers. &nbsp;Similarly, the longer you know someone, the more you become aware of different layers to their personality. &nbsp;Some people have lots of positive layers at the top-qualities that make us like or respect them and want to be around them. These people often become our dear friends. Others have lots of negative layers at the top which make them prickly and difficult to be around. We tend to avoid these people or even think of them as our enemies.&nbsp;<br /><br />The truth that I'm discovering is that&nbsp;<strong>all&nbsp;</strong>people have bad and good layers. Even the people we love and hold close will have some negative layers that we'll have to deal with. These layers might be quirks or odd habits that irritate us, they may be more serious layers caused by sin, or they may be emotional difficulties that are caused by circumstances beyond others' control such as emotional or mental disorders or the effects of abuse.&nbsp; On the other hand, those we think of as our enemies also have good layers...good qualities that we don't see at first or simply choose to overlook because we are so annoyed by their bad layers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Either way, people's negative layers will cause us some discomfort. Then we have to decide what to do with that discomfort.&nbsp; Patience would say that we have to focus on the good and learn how to handle the bad.&nbsp; Again, the atonement is key in this step. As mentioned before, we can pray for the father to soften our hearts towards that person...to see them as he does. &nbsp;In his classic talk, "Jesus: The Perfect Leader," President Spencer W. Kimball said, "We must remember that those mortals we meet in parking lots, offices, elevators, and elsewhere are that portion of mankind God has given us to love and to serve. It will do us little good to speak of the general brotherhood of mankind if we cannot regard those who are all around us as our brothers and sisters."&nbsp;<br /><br />Just think of the number of people on this earth that you will never meet. Doesn't it seem likely that those we do meet are more than mere coincidences or inconveniences? They are the people that God would have us learn to love and serve. My mission president reminded missionaries of this when they called asking to be transferred from a difficult companion. "Yes, I can transfer you," he'd say, "but what are you going to do when you have a child or spouse that acts just like them? You can learn the lesson now or later. You choose."&nbsp;<br /><br />President Kimball goes on to say, "[Jesus] gave [his disciples] important and specific things to do for their development. Other leaders have sought to be so omnicompetent that they have tried to do everything themselves, which produces little growth in others. Jesus trusts his followers enough to share his work with them so that they can grow. If we brush other people aside in order to see a task done more quickly and effectively, the task may get done all right, but without the growth and development in followers that is so important."<a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2011_11_29_Gee.htm#_edn13" target="_self"></a><sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Perhaps you've served in the church long enough to realize that efficiency isn't necessarily God's number one priority. Our growth is. We need to be reminded of this in our interactions with others.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most dramatic examples of God's patience with our mistakes and His hope for our growth is when Joseph Smith lost the 116 pages.&nbsp; You all know that when Joseph asked if Martin Harris could take the pages, God told him no. He told him no several times. Finally, God let them have their way, with strong warnings about keeping the pages secure. Well, Martin lost the pages. When Joseph heard the news, he cried out in great agony: "All is lost! All is lost! What shall I do? I have sinned-it is I who tempted the wrath of God. I should have been satisfied with the first answer which I received from the Lord; for he told me that it was not safe to let the writing go out of my possession."<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Imagine how Joseph felt when he learned the God had foreseen his mistake. Keith R. Perkins writes, "The Lord had anticipated this event by at least twenty-four hundred years; many prophets had labored in part so that Joseph could repent and continue his work of translation. I know of no other example that shows better the Lord's foreknowledge and his love for us as individuals."&nbsp;<br /><br />"The Lord had commanded Nephi to make two separate records: the large plates, primarily a political history, and the small plates, a religious history, 'for a wise purpose in him, which purpose I know not.' (1 Ne. 9:5; emphasis added.) Mormon was surprised to find the small plates of Nephi as he was abridging the records, but he, like Nephi, was impressed to keep the small plates separate, even though he did not know why. 'And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me, according to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me. ... The Lord knoweth all things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to his will.' (W. of M. 1:7; emphasis added.)&nbsp;<br /><br />"Two separate records had been kept by the prophets for almost five hundred years, not only so that the Lord's covenant with Nephi, Jacob, Enos, and others could be fulfilled, but also because of the Lord's great love for Joseph Smith. The existence of the second record made it possible for the Prophet to 'repent of that which thou hast done which is contrary to the commandment' of God. (D&amp;C 3:10.)"&nbsp;<br /><br />This experience lasted for three months. Joseph gave the manuscript to Martin Harris on June 14, 1828. He was not able to resume translating until September 22, at which point the angel Moroni returned the Urim and Thummim to him. His mother reports Joseph's words: "The angel seemed pleased with me, and he told me that the Lord loved me for my faithfulness and humility." Think of what Joseph learned from this experience, although it temporarily halted the progress of translating the Book of Mormon.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Is our patience with other's mistakes as merciful as the Lord's? In this case, Joseph made a very real mistake with possibly eternal consequences. Would we be quick to condemn him and think the Lord should have chosen someone else? But think of what Joseph learned from this experience. He later could say with conviction, "Whatever the Lord requires is right, no matter what it is-although we may not see the reason thereof until long after the events transpire."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />Think of what we can accomplish if we learn to have this kind of patience with one another. In a quote attributed to Goethe, he states, "If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat people as they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable of becoming."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />An example of this concept comes from F. Enzio Busche. He was working with a young man in the Young Men's program in post World-War II Europe. This seventeen-year-old boy was working in a foundry where hot iron was poured into molds. One of the older workers regularly picked on the boy, stealing his tools, teasing him, and occasionally beating him up. One day, he again stole his tools. The boy went to the restroom, knelt down, and prayed. "He suddenly felt a great peace come into his soul. Calmly he went back to the man and apologized to him, saying, "I have accused you of things, for which I am sorry. I do not want to accuse you. I have so many reasons to be grateful that I am permitted to work with you. You are a good man, and I look up to you as an example, because I need to have an example in my life." These words were sincere, because the Lord had shown him the goodness hidden in that man.&nbsp;<br /><br />The man broke down in tears. "I am not a good man. I am not a good example." He admitted to stealing the boy's tools and then said, "I am not worthy to be an example to you, but from now on, I will try." That was the beginning of a solid friendship.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<br /><br />In closing, I suggest that patience is not just a trait that it would be nice to have. It is a trait that is vital to our progress as disciples of Christ. Vital to becoming like our Father. As Elder Maxwell wisely said, "The more I examine the gospel of Jesus Christ, the more I understand that the Lord's commitment to free agency is very, very deep! So much deeper than is our own. [This commitment to agency] combined with his everlasting and perfect love places a high premium on the virtue of patience. There is simply no other way for true growth to occur."<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;The Lord loves us and he sent us here to learn and grow. For that to occur, we must have patience with ourselves and others. Patience like he has.&nbsp;<br /><br />In closing, let me review. Patience is a way of demonstrating faith in God by:&nbsp;<br /><br />Putting our desires on hold and submitting to his timing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>stepping away from the gumball machine</strong></p>
<p>Sustaining our obedience when results are not immediate or obvious&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>using the flat periods in our lives to progress</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Allowing others to exercise their agency in order to progress</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>looking for the positive layers in peoples personalities and helping them to develop</strong></p>
<p>When I think of the patience Heavenly Father has with me, I am brought to my knees in gratitude. He is the motivating and sustaining power in my life. Although he tests me, He has never left me alone and He has never stopped loving me. I want to humbly bear my testimony of that to all of you. He loves us. He will never fail us. Let us try to reflect just a portion of his patience in our own lives, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ amen.</p>

<p>I have always been intrigued by the story in the Book of Mormon involving Korihor. He demanded a sign from Alma the prophet of God to convince him that there was a God. Yet Alma's response was emphatic:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when you have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator" (Alma 30:44).</p>
<p>I testify that this is true! I believe that everywhere we look and everything we see, hear and experience--in fact, the very idea that we can see, hear, and experience, all testifies of the fact that there is a loving and personal God in the heavens whose wondrous plan allows us to come here to this amazing planet and partake of this incredible experience we call mortality. If everything denotes that there is a God, then everywhere you look can build your testimony.&nbsp;<br /><br />Every time you glance to the west around sunset and pause to consider a masterful Creator in the heavens with a paintbrush and palette with colors that almost seem unreal, you realize there is a loving and kind Heavenly Father who shows us a small peak into His creative genius. If you have ever climbed up Table Rock in the nearby Teton range and been inspired by the beautiful scenery all of the way to the top only to have your jaw drop as you gaze upon the massive and amazing Grand Teton range right in front of you. You and I have seen views of a lush rainforest, an imposing desert, the powerful erosion of a canyon wall, the beauty of a cascading waterfall to the immensity of the stars in the heavens. We have experienced examples from the vast vistas of this incredible earth to the intricate details of a simple flower. They all speak of a God who is all-powerful, all knowing, and present in all things.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, everyone you meet can lead you closer to Christ and help you become more like Him. There is a command in the Doctrine and Covenants to "Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand." Then the Lord decides to get more specific, just in case we weren't understanding what types of learning we should focus on: "Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms." And then He tells us why we are to learn these things: "That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you" (Doctrine and Covenants 88:78-80).&nbsp;<br /><br />What a divine commission! It sounds like we are to learn it all--whether it is astronomy, geology, chemistry, physics, biology, history, religion, music, art, archeology, international relations, mathematics, social sciences, interior design, construction, home and family, and more. Maybe that is why this institution exists, to help in all of that. Actually, this is a perfect place to learn of all of these things. The classes are right here. The timing is just right. You have a great opportunity here to learn physics, chemistry and astronomy and other classes from great instructors of faith and abilities. The Foundations program also helps with learning these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe that it goes for us personally as well. We need to see the Lord and His gospel in all aspects of our lives and the lives of those around us. Recently, my family had the opportunity of living abroad in Israel, where Latter-day Saints were quite the minority. Yet everywhere we looked, there lived great people of other faiths who showed us by their walk and their talk that they lived the gospel according to their best understandings. I learned what it meant to be envious of someone's religious beliefs. I envied the Jews, the Christians, and the Muslims for their devotion and zeal to their God and their religion and to sacred places.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is quite singular that the Jews are even recognized as a distinct people today. They have somehow kept their identity as a people for almost 4,000 years, despite the scatterings and migrations and persecutions they have faced. Yet I learned from them how important it was for them to keep the Sabbath day holy. Almost all Christians believe in the Ten Commandments given to Moses on Mount Sinai. Yet how many of them treat the Sabbath day as just another day of the week?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Several years ago a poll on sin was given in the mass media and they asked which of the Ten Commandments still had application in our lives today. It is nice to note that 97 percent of the people who responded said that "Thou shalt not kill" was still important today.&nbsp; You would have to hope that those in the 3 percent who said it was okay to kill are not your neighbors. But only a little over half of those polled said that keeping the Sabbath day holy was important today. Those two commandments, not killing and keeping the Sabbath day holy, were part of the same creed. They were both given by the same God at the same time to the same people.&nbsp;<br /><br />My family noted how careful the Jews were in Israel to keep that commandment to the best of their abilities. They made sure their shopping was completed well before their Sabbath began. Many orthodox Jews would not even turn on lights in their homes or turn on or off their ovens on the Sabbath day to avoid what they considered to be breaking the Sabbath. When the Sabbath arrived, they do not drive cars. They would dress up in the Sabbath best and walk to their synagogues and rejoice and sing and welcome in the queen of the Sabbath. My family laughs now at an experience that happened while we were eating a Sabbath dinner at one of our orthodox Jewish Friend's home. The couple had a couple of young children. One was 5 years old and he left the table to use the restroom.&nbsp;<br /><br />While there, we heard him say to his parents he saw a spider in the bathroom. The father told him not to kill the spider, because it was the Sabbath day. Almost immediately, he heard the young boy say, "Too late. I killed it!" These Jews were a great reminder of the importance of keeping that day holy. They took it as seriously today as if it had been given to them anew from God.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was often reminded of a quote I had heard that helped me understand what has happened generationally to this holy day over the years. "Our great-grandfathers called it the Holy Sabbath. Our grandfathers called it the Sabbath. Our fathers called it Sunday. Today we call it the weekend." You can see the drift that has occurred in our day from keeping one of the Ten Commandments.&nbsp; How many Christian supported schools play football games on the Sabbath? How many people do their shopping on that day, etc. I learned from this wonderful people the importance of striving to keep the Sabbath day holy in my life. I know I can do better as I see their example.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another commandment I was inspired to keep better was my devotion to God in prayer. The Muslim peoples are such a great example of those who keep this very important time of communion with our Father faithfully in our day. The call to prayer emits from minarets surrounding their mosques five times a day. The first is at 4:00 in the morning! I must admit the first several times I heard this wake me up in the wee hours of the morning were not very inspiring. This would be the Mormon equivalent of hearing over loudspeakers in your apartment complexes, "Ere You Left Your Room This Morning, Did You Think To Pray?"&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />That call to prayer is so beautiful to me now. The call "Allah Akbar! God is Great!" softens my heart and reminds me of the all important opportunity I have to talk with my Heavenly Father, and that the Muslims do five times every day. Shopkeepers in the Old City of Jerusalem would place a wooden stick across their shops to let people know that they were away for a time to go to their prayers in the mosque. Their shop doors were open and nothing more than that stick was between thousands of dollars of merchandise and the busy throng of customers passing by. I thought of their trust in mankind's integrity, but also of their dedication to this great pillar of their faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Once while travelling from Egypt back to Jerusalem, we were at a border crossing in the middle of the desert. There was no mosque and we were waiting for a bus to come and take us along our journey home. We noticed a young Muslim man who was waiting with us leave our group and found a cardboard box that he flattened out. He picked it up and went a ways off the road into the desert and looked up into the sky to get his bearings and set the flattened box on the ground and then proceeded to pray towards Mecca. I was at first amused but then quickly rebuked as I admired this man's devotion towards God. He was living his religion despite the inconveniences and what others might think. I was deeply envious of this dear Son of God and his devotion to his God. A great lesson was taught and learned that day.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Old City of Jerusalem is the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. To more than 70 percent of the entire Christian world, it is the holiest spot on earth. They believe it is built over the places where the Savior hung on the cross at Calvary and then where His body was embalmed and then laid in Joseph of Arimathea's tomb. Christian pilgrims come from around the world to pay homage to the place where their Savior suffered and died. There is a stone slab three feet by six feet long that is believed by them to be the place where Jesus' body was placed after being taken down from the cross and wrapped prior to being placed in the tomb.&nbsp;<br /><br />We would see people from all over the world come and fall down upon the stone and kiss it and place candles and other artifacts upon it to make them more holy. They would then return with these items to their homes having in a sense sanctified them by having them touch a place where they believed Jesus touched. Others would climb steep stairs and wait in long lines to place their hands in the spot where they believed Jesus' cross was placed. They would again wait in lines to enter the edicule (a monument) to touch the slab that covered the place where Jesus' body laid before He was resurrected.&nbsp;<br /><br />On Fridays, there would always be a procession of pilgrims who would retrace the steps of Jesus as He was led from Pilate's palace to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. They would stop at all of the 14 Stations of the Cross and recount the events that happened there along the way. It deepened my faith in my own dear Savior as I witnessed their devotion. As you might have sensed in my descriptions of these dear people, there is so much good in this world. So many people with a deep love and conviction for their Savior and God. I now have a greater sense from the Jews to keep the Sabbath day holy, and from the Muslims to have a more constant and abiding connection with my Heavenly Father through prayer, and from the Christians of a greater sense of the sacred, and of holy spaces than I had before.&nbsp;<br /><br />This sense of the sacred was addressed in great detail by Elder D. Todd Christofferson in a devotional he gave at BYU several years ago. He mentioned how our generation has somehow not transmitted to your generation the importance of helping you have this sense of sacred things. Quoting Elder Christofferson:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The importance of having a sense of the sacred is simply this--if one does not appreciate holy things, he will lose them. Absent of a feeling of reverence, he will grow increasingly casual in attitude and lax in conduct. He will drift from the moorings that his covenants with God could provide. His feeling of accountability to God will diminish and then be forgotten. Thereafter, he will care only about his own comfort and satisfying his uncontrolled appetites. Finally, he will come to despise sacred things, even God, and then he will despise himself."&nbsp;</p>
<p>He gave a few examples that I believe will be instructive to us all. One dealt with how we reverence the 15 prophets, seers and revelators that we have on the earth today. He related a story that occurred in the life of Elder Robert D. Hales years before he was called as an apostle himself:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Some years ago Father, then over eighty years of age, was expecting a visit from a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on a snowy winter day. Father, an artist, had painted a picture of the home of the Apostle. Rather than have the painting delivered to him, this sweet Apostle wanted to go personally to pick the painting up and thank my father for it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Knowing that Father would be concerned that everything was in readiness for the forthcoming visit, I dropped by his home. Because of the depth of the snow, snowplows had caused a snow bank in front of the walkway to the front door. Father had shoveled the walks and then labored to remove the snow bank. He returned to the house exhausted and in pain. When I arrived, he was experiencing heart pain from overexertion and stressful anxiety. My first concern was to warn him of his unwise physical efforts. Didn't he know what the result of his labor would be?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"'Robert,' he said through interrupted short breaths, 'do you realize an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ is coming to my home? The walks must be clean. He should not have to come through a snowdrift.' He raised his hand, saying, 'Oh, Robert, don't ever forget or take for granted the privilege it is to know and to serve with Apostles of the Lord'" ("Gratitude for the Goodness of God,"&nbsp;<em>Ensign</em>, May 1992, 64).</p>
<p>We need to have a sense of the sacred when we listen and hearken and obey counsel as given by these holy men. The Book of Mormon warns us of this very thing:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth, both to the body and the soul, others set at naught and trample under their feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel do men trample under their feet; I say, trample under their feet but I would speak in other words--they set him at naught, and hearken not to the voice of his counsels" (1 Nephi 19:7).</p>
<p>A second warning about having a sense of the sacred given by Elder Christofferson was for our bodies and our dress and grooming. He mentioned how he has noticed a casualness in the efforts of our members on their dress to sacrament meetings and other religious meetings:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I speak now of immodest, casual, or slovenly dress and grooming that in particular times and places mocks the sacredness of what is taking place or of the place itself. Let me give you an example. A while back a young woman from another state came to live with some of her relatives in the Salt Lake City area for a few weeks. On her first Sunday she came to church dressed in a simple, nice blouse and knee-length skirt set off with a light, button-up sweater. She wore hose and dress shoes, and her hair was combed simply but with care. Her overall appearance created an impression of youthful grace.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Unfortunately, she immediately felt out of place. It seemed like all the other young women her age or near her age were dressed in casual skirts, some rather distant from the knee; tight T-shirt-like tops that barely met the top of their skirts at the waist (some bare instead of barely); no socks or stockings; and clunky sneakers or flip-flops.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"One would have hoped that seeing the new girl, the other girls would have realized how inappropriate their manner of dress was for a chapel and for the Sabbath day and immediately changed for the better. Sad to say, however, they did not, and it was the visitor who, in order to fit in, adopted the fashion (if you can call it that) of her host ward.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It is troubling to see this growing trend that is not limited to young women but extends to older women, to men, and to young men as well. Some say dress and hair don't matter--it's what's inside that counts. I believe that truly it is what's inside a person that counts, but that's what worries me. Casual dress at holy places and events is a message about what is inside a person.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It may be pride or rebellion or something else, but at a minimum it says, 'I don't get it. I don't understand the difference between the sacred and the profane.' In that condition they are easily drawn away from the Lord. They do not appreciate the value of what they have. I worry about them. Unless they can gain some understanding and capture some feeling for sacred things, they are at risk of eventually losing all that matters most. You are Saints of the great latter-day dispensation--look the part."</p>
<p>Returning once again to the lessons I learned in Israel from our spiritual cousins, the Jews and the Muslims: they do have a sense of the sacred when it comes to dress and grooming. We noted that Muslim women were always modest in their apparel. They wore clothes that were plain and covered their heads and arms and legs. Muslim men had hairstyles that were neat and short and groomed very well. Jewish women likewise were modest. Unfortunately, sometimes our students had to wear extra scarves into their sanctuaries or mosques or synagogues to cover themselves up before they were allowed into their holy places.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />How do we keep a sense for the sacred? How do we know when we are drifting away and losing the ability to recognize that we may be drifting away from sacred things? I believe that there are two ways to help us keep a sense of the sacred. One is to invite and be worthy of the Holy Spirit. The gentle urgings of the spirit will help us feel what is sacred around us. And second is to pray for the gift of discernment. This gift helps magnify many other gifts of the Spirit. It may be what you might call a gateway gift. It will help us discern between shades of degrees to know when we need to alter our behavior to have a better sense of the sacred. It will also soften our hearts and give us courage to change.&nbsp;<br /><br />Back in 2001, Elder David A. Bednar was teaching a class here on campus. He told the class a story that occurred while he was a stake president in Arkansas. He was interviewing a 17-year-old young man who wasn't too sure that he wanted to serve a mission. After listening to the young man, President Bednar then asked him, "Why do you think you were born?"&nbsp;<br /><br />That is a question that I would like to pose to you this day: "Why do you think you were born?" Have you ever stopped to think about that? By being able to answer that one simple question might help us in making better decisions in this life. Other related questions are: "Why was I born at this time in the history of the world?" or "Why was I born to parents in the gospel when so many of our Heavenly Father's children do not have this blessing?" or "Why do I have the opportunity of obtaining an education at a Church-sponsored school when so many don't have or can't afford this blessing?" These are valid and soul-searching questions. Sometimes we forget who we are. We allow the world to trick us into forgetting why we are here and what are true goals in life should be.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Consider the story of the man who was returning home from a long trip abroad and found himself in an airport waiting for his connecting flight home. There was a delay, so he went and purchased a newspaper and some milk and cookies and sat down at a table to wait for his next flight. As he was reading his newspaper, he noticed some rustling at his table. From behind his paper, he noticed a neatly dressed young woman helping herself to his cookies.&nbsp;<br /><br />He did not want to make a scene, so he leaned across and took a cookie himself. He went back to reading his paper thinking this was now settled. A minute passed when he heard more rustling. He was flabbergasted to see that she was eating another one of his cookies. So he stared her down and then took another cookie. The young lady didn't seem offended. She then took another one herself. He then grabbed another cookie and ate it and she did the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />They traded off eating cookies until it came down to the last cookie. It shocked him to see that she took the last cookie and then right in front of him, she broke the cookie in half, passed half of the cookie to him and then ate the other half, got up and left. He sat in shocked disbelief and was still fuming when he heard over the loudspeaker that his flight was about to board. He took the newspaper and folded it up and shoved it into his bag. It was then that he noticed his bag of cookies. The whole time he had been eating her cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Imagine his embarrassment. Imagine her wondering what this guy's problem was. Do we sometimes make a rash decision or judgment on someone, because we have inadequate information? How do we avoid making mistakes like this? We need to know who we are and where we are going and whose cookies we are eating. Marianne Williamson said a quote that I think applies here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.&nbsp;It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us.&nbsp;We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be, you are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world.&nbsp;There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so others won't feel insecure around you.&nbsp;We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us, it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."</p>
<p>This brings us back to the scriptural admonition of learning it all. It would be tough to accomplish while you are here at BYU-Idaho. So I will suggest an idea that I am sure you have already heard, but I would like to remind you of. That is to be a lifelong learner.&nbsp; While here in school I would recommend taking a class or two outside of your area of study. Be curious! Take that class in photography or humanities that interests you. There might never be a better time to do this.&nbsp;<br /><br />But then as you finish your degrees, then make a plan to continue to grow and learn and develop that will continue for the rest of your eternal lives. The Joseph Smith Translation of Matthew 5:48 says, "Ye are therefore commanded to be perfect!" If you are to become like our Heavenly Parents then you just might have to learn chemistry, the building block of creating a world of your own. That is when geology and botany and biology and anatomy and physiology will also come in handy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There is so much to learn and do. It does not need to be done or learned all at once. We do not have to run faster than we have strength, but we should have a plan of sorts. I would recommend having a list of good books that interest you that you can read when you have a little more time. Have a bucket list of things you wish to do or accomplish when your resources are a little deeper. Collect uplifting quotes that inspire you that you can think upon in those quiet moments of your lives. I began on my mission to write down quotes I heard from teachers, companions and later students that inspired me to be better. I filled up two books before I began putting them on a web page. I love this one from Sister Marjorie Pay Hinckley, the wife of President Gordon B. Hinckley:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I don't want to drive up to the&nbsp;pearly gates in a shiny sports car, wearing beautifully, tailored clothes, my hair expertly coiffed, and with long, perfectly manicured fingernails.&nbsp;I want to drive up in a station wagon that has mud on the wheels from taking kids to scout camp. I want to be there with a smudge of peanut butter on my shirt from making sandwiches for a sick neighbor's children. I want to be there with a little dirt under my fingernails from helping to weed someone's garden. I want to be there with children's sticky kisses on my cheeks and the tears of a friend on my shoulder. I want the Lord to know I was really here and that I really lived."</p>
<p>Another from J.R.R. Tolkien from his book&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All that is gold does not glitter,<br />Not all those who wander are lost,<br />The old that is strong does not wither,<br />Deep roots are not reached by the frost.</p>
<p>The last one I would like to share is from Rudyard Kipling that helped me decide to be a better person. It is titled "If":</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you can keep your head when all about you<br />Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br />If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you<br />But make allowance for their doubting too.<br />If you can wait and not be tired of waiting<br />Or be lied about--don't deal in lies.<br />Or be hated--don't give way to hating,<br />And yet don't look to good, nor talk too wise.<br />If you can dream--and not make dreams your master<br />If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim.<br />If you can meet with triumph and disaster<br />And treat those two imposters just the same.<br />If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br />Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />Or watch the things you gave your life to--broken,<br />And stoop and build them up with worn out tools.<br />If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss,<br />And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br />And never breathe a word about your loss.<br />If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />To serve their turn long after they are gone.<br />And to hold on when there is nothing within you<br />except the will which says to them, "Hold on!"<br />If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue<br />or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch.<br />If neither foes or loving friends can hurt you<br />If all men count with you, but none too much.<br />If you can fill the unforgiving minutes<br />with sixty seconds worth of distance run<br />Yours is the earth and everything that's in it,<br />And which is more, you'll be a man, my son.</p>
<p>Just a quick piece of advice. As I said, you don't need to learn it all, all at once. We all have noticed some people who start fast and then fade. This happens in races, but also in Church callings, and many other facets in life. There are others who start off very slowly and when they see the finish line or end, they speed up and finish strong. These are not inherently bad, but I believe it is mostly what we do in the middle. There is a lot more middle than on either end.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Think of the new year fast approaching. Many of us will make goals. Do we start them quickly and soon forget them? Do we forget about them until the end of the year and then try to do them all at once? It is what we do in the middle that matters most. Apply this to your schooling. How many of us start our schooling with high hopes, but only to forget those hopes and dreams until it may be too late in our schooling to fix or correct something? The same thing happens in every semester. I see students who start strong and quickly fade. I see others who right about now want to know how they can salvage their grade when they have missed assignments and deadlines or have not done well on tests. I am always so impressed with the students who are consistent throughout the semester, who come to every class and do all their assignments, and who ask appropriate questions along the way (hopefully before an assignment comes due). It is the middle that matters! It is the middle where you gain what can be called "muscle memory."&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify to you that there is a God! He is real and personal and loving. He is also just. I challenge you to find God in everywhere you look and in everyone you meet. Unlike Korihor, I know you will see Him everywhere you look. Now is the time to prepare to meet our God. And when we meet Him, it is my hope and prayer that we will each hear these memorable words, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things:&nbsp; enter thou into the joy of thy lord" (Matthew 25:21). In the holy and sacred name of our Savior and Redeemer, whose birth we now and forever celebrate, Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Graduates, Families and Friends,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a great pleasure, President Clark, to join with you, your wife, Sue and the faculty to rejoice with you wonderful graduates on this special day. I congratulate you and your parents for attaining this singular honor. To attain a cherished goal in the presence of family and friends is a memorable experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most significant benefits you have received in your education is the knowledge that will prepare you for the eternities - &ldquo;&hellip;things which have been, things which are, things which must&hellip;come to pass&hellip;&rdquo; (D&amp;C 88:78-79).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My purpose today is to challenge you to work with people of other faiths to improve the moral fabric of this nation and the world and to protect religious freedom. In order to do this, you need to understand and comprehend &ldquo;things which have been&rdquo; with particular emphasis on certain knowledge and events which were precursors to the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and still need to be protected. These are the underpinnings of our Judeo-Christian heritage and bless people worldwide.<sup>1</sup> If you understand these events, then as graduates of this great university, you can help protect, defend, and with your unique abilities, enhance those elements of knowledge that will bless mankind, prepare for the Kingdom of God, and bring you happiness and joy. Much of what you will do to improve the moral fabric and protect religious freedom will be accomplished in your families and the communities in which you live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will review four major &ldquo;things which have been&rdquo; that were precursors to the restoration of the gospel, and&nbsp; then suggest three additional courses of action that are particularly relevant today and that will build on the great heritage that has been bestowed on each of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two recent news items caused me to reflect on this topic for today.&nbsp; First, the British Museum and the British Broadcasting Company released a book last month titled, &ldquo;The History of the World in 100 Objects.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second news item is the reportage of events surrounding the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the King James Translation of the Bible.&nbsp; A month ago today, November 16, there was a ceremony marking the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary at Westminster Abbey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two news items caused me to review some of the most important events that occurred prior to the restoration of the gospel that can assist you regardless of your academic discipline in being a better citizen and a better Latter-day Saint.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tyndale and the King James Bible</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First on my list is a unique and profoundly important group of achievements which occurred during the 1500s and early 1600s. William Tyndale, a man of strong religious beliefs and a gifted linguist, translated the Hebrew and Greek versions of the Bible existing at that time into English. His translation contained &ldquo;phraseology that we associate with the sacredness of the word of God.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup> It was the language of religion; the language that captured the dramatic importance of the Old Testament and of the Savior&rsquo;s eternal spiritual message, ministry, and mission set forth in the New Testament. Tyndale&rsquo;s vision was that the common laborer, the plow boy in England, as he described it, could read and understand the Bible. His language became to religion what William Shakespeare&rsquo;s writings were to the language of literature and social discourse in the English tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the enhancement of the English language produced by Shakespeare and the eloquent translations into English by Tyndale, wise and noble scholars produced the magnificent King James Version of the Bible in 1611. This Bible speaks to our personal commitments and evokes language that speaks to the heart. The text on the title page contained the phrase, &ldquo;Appointed to be read in churches&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; It was intended to be read, meaning read aloud, in church. It was meant for the ear and not simply for the eye.<sup>4</sup> &ldquo;The King James translation introduced 18 classic phrases into the English language and made famous some 240 more from earlier English translations.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup> Examples are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To everything there is a season,&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beat their swords into plowshares,&rsquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;A thorn in the flesh,&rsquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Suffer little children.&rsquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will never forget when Elder Ballard and I were reviewing the first draft of the new missionary guide, <em>Preach My Gospel</em> with President Boyd K. Packer at his home. After his review, President Packer asked, &ldquo;Will this prepare and assist our missionaries in understanding and appreciating the majesty of the King James Version of the Bible?&rdquo; I immediately understood the very high standard he expected <em>Preach My Gospel </em>to attain. Most writings have a relatively short life span. Language matters. Truth with examples, elegance and civility endures. This great book of scripture, The King James Bible, has endured and is as important to us today as it was 400 years ago.&nbsp; Significantly, we share with the vast majority of citizens a love and appreciation for the Judeo/Christian values set forth in the King James Bible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second on my list are the English Common Law and the US Constitution. At about the same time in history as the events I just described, Sir Edward Coke, spelled C-o-k-e, but usually pronounced Cook, obviously no relation, produced the consolidation of the English law in written form. His work was to law what Shakespeare&rsquo;s was to literature and what the King James Bible was to religion. In continental Europe the Emperor Justinian&rsquo;s <em>Corpus Juris Civilis </em>was a written body of law for jurists and professors. In contrast, Coke&rsquo;s (Cook&rsquo;s) common law was based on precedent. It was principle based reasoning from individual situations adapted to changing circumstances. Perhaps his most famous pronouncement is &ldquo;An Englishman&rsquo;s home is his castle.&rdquo; His volumes covered every conceivable legal topic and stated what the common law was on each.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people consider the provisions of the common law produced by Coke (Cook) as a foundation for the constitutional provisions contained in the U.S. Constitution which has been viewed by Latter-day Saints as both inspired and as necessary to the restoration of the gospel. My intent here is not to provide a scholarly analysis of the Constitution. However, it is interesting that President J. Reuben Clark and Elder Dallin H. Oaks, two apostles who had previously been eminent lawyers, share a common view of our understanding that the Constitution is divinely inspired. Neither of them has seen every word of the Constitution as being inspired. Elder Oaks has said, &ldquo;Our reverence for the United States Constitution is so great that we sometimes speak as if its every word and phrase had the same standing as scripture. &ldquo; He continues, &ldquo;I have never considered it necessary to defend that possibility.&rdquo; President J. Reuben Clark enunciated a similar view in an address given in 1939. I concur with their assessment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two great leaders, between them, identified 5 elements of the Constitution as being particularly inspired. First is the separation of powers into three independent branches of government. Second is the Bill of Rights&rsquo; guarantee of freedom of speech, press, and religion. The third is the equality of all men and women before the law. The fourth is the Federal System with the division of powers between the nation as a whole and the various states and the fifth is the principle of popular sovereignty. The people are the source of government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think most of us would agree with President J. Reuben Clark and Elder Dallin H. Oaks that these incredibly significant fundamental principles elegantly combined in the Constitutional documents are indeed inspired and coincide with doctrinal principles in our scriptures. It does not require detailed analysis of the Constitution to see that these five basic fundamentals have been a great blessing to the United States and were necessary to the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Again, we share with the vast majority of citizens a love and appreciation for the Constitution. Many are equally concerned about efforts by some to diminish the Bill of Rights&rsquo; guarantee of freedom of religion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third on my list, which I will review very briefly, are the scientific achievements including the Industrial Revolution, the Communication Revolution, and advancements in medicine that have greatly blessed us today. President Spencer W. Kimball acknowledged these achievements and the contribution they provide to the Kingdom. He saw some of this body of scientific knowledge as a precursor to the restoration and encouraged Latter-day Saints to participate in the acquisition of this knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daniel Walker Howe, in his Pulitzer Prize winning history of the transformation of America between 1815 and 1848, titled his book, What Hath God Wrought. In his introduction he focuses on Professor Samuel F. B. Morse and notes that &ldquo;for thousands of years messages had been limited by the speed with which messengers could travel&hellip;.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Morse, seated amidst a hushed gathering of distinguished national leaders in the chambers of the United States Supreme Court in Washington, tapped out a message&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; on a new device, the telegraph:&nbsp; &ldquo;WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup> &ldquo;As Morse later commented, the message &lsquo;baptized the American telegraph with the name of its author&rsquo;<strong>: GOD</strong>. Morse shared a &lsquo;religious sense of divine providence&rsquo;<sup>8</sup> and saw himself as an &lsquo;instrument of providence.&rsquo;&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Gerrit W. Gong has eloquently summarized these events: &ldquo;For those&hellip;who see Heaven&rsquo;s hand in the affairs of men, it comes as no coincidence that the central theme of What Hath God Wrought is that the &ldquo;early nineteenth century [was] a time of a communications revolution."<sup>10</sup> Howe states, &ldquo;During the thirty-three years that began in 1815, there would be greater strides in the improvement of communication than had taken place in all previous centuries.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second communications revolution has occurred during the lives of those of us in this BYU-Idaho Center. The most significant part of this involves the internet.&nbsp; This is an area where you have great understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fourth and most essential achievement on my list was and is again for our own day a return to Judeo/Christian moral principles. This was especially necessary for the restoration of the gospel. This emphasis on morality occurred both in England and in the United States. This involved fervent religious awakenings, including those associated with the area of western New York State which became known as the &ldquo;&lsquo;burned-over&rsquo; district,&rsquo; because the fires of religious zeal swept across it.&rdquo;<sup>12</sup> One English writer described this return to morality as &ldquo;an overpowering sense of accountability and a responsibility to God, for their actions.&rdquo;<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The practice of religious beliefs had been a principal reason for the original settlements in New England, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.&nbsp; &ldquo;More material was printed in mid-18<sup>th</sup>-century America about religion than about political science, history, and law combined&hellip;.&rdquo;<sup>14</sup> On the eve of the Revolutionary War religious pamphlets, &ldquo;topped secular pamphlets from all 13 colonies by 4 to 1.&rdquo;<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A farmer who had fought at Concord Bridge &ldquo;declared that he had never heard of Locke or Sidney, his reading having been limited to the Bible, the Catechism, Watt&rsquo;s Psalms and Hymns, and the Almanac.&rdquo;<sup>16</sup> It was these principles that he was defending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a recent op-ed in <em>The New York Times</em> prominent writer David Brooks in an article titled, &ldquo;The Great Restoration&rdquo; noted that many people believe &ldquo;that repairing the economic moral fabric is the essential national task right now.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;America went through a similar values restoration in the 1820s. Then, too, people sensed that the country had grown soft and decadent. Then, too, Americans rebalanced. They did it quietly and away from the cameras.&rdquo;<sup>17</sup> I was deeply touched when I read this article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be a righteous example <br /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can you help bring about this restoration of morality in our day and help preserve religious freedom? First, be a righteous example. You must not be in camouflage as to who you are and what you believe. Many of you are or will be in interviews for jobs or post-graduate work. Elder J. Devn Cornish, a recently called General Authority, who prior to the calling was a nationally recognized professor in the pediatric department at Emory University School of Medicine and one of the foremost pediatricians in the U.S., tells of his efforts to be admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the interview he had with the distinguished professors at the medical school, they asked him why he wanted to be a doctor. He started out by telling them that he wanted to be a pediatrician. They interrupted him and asked how he could possibly know that when he hadn&rsquo;t even been to medical school.&nbsp; He explained to them with great passion that he had the privilege of serving an LDS mission in the Guatemala-El Salvador Mission. He had seen the terrible condition of the children and the enormous need they had for medical care. This, and the promptings of the spirit, had inspired in him a desire to attend medical school and specialize in pediatrics. He reports in looking back on the experience that many students were seeing medical school in terms of status or economics rather than simply the desire to serve and bless mankind. He was surprised as these world famous physicians extended his interview. They were interested in what he did as a missionary, his ability to speak Spanish, and his interaction with and love of the people that he had served.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think in this so called &ldquo;Mormon Moment&rdquo; where there is more attention being paid to the Church and its members, we will need to be the best examples we can possibly be. Collectively our example will be more important than what any single member or leader proposes. Church research has shown that those who know faithful Latter-day Saints appreciate our honesty, integrity, morality, and desire to be of service to our fellowmen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, we met with a top government leader in a South American country. He had also been a physician before his election. We did not expect a particularly good meeting because some of his views are not in accord with certain principles that are very important to us. We were surprised when we were received in a warm and gracious manner. He had only known one LDS member - a fellow student in the medical school he attended. He admired this student, knew about our beliefs, and was most respectful because of one example of a Latter-day Saint whose life was based on honesty, integrity, and morality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be civil in your discourse</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to be civil in our discourse and respectful in our interactions. We live in a world where there is much turmoil. Many people are both angry and afraid. The Savior taught us to love even our enemies (Matthew 5:44). This is especially true when we disagree. The moral basis of civility is the Golden Rule. It is taught in most religions and particularly by the Savior. &ldquo;And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise&rdquo; (Luke 6:31). Our faith requires that we treat our neighbors with respect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a General Conference address I pointed out &ldquo;&hellip;there are some who feel that venting their personal anger or deeply held opinions is more important than conducting themselves as Jesus Christ lived and taught&hellip;to recognize that how we disagree is a real measure of who we are and whether we truly follow the Savior. It is appropriate to disagree, but it is not appropriate to be disagreeable&hellip;If we show love and respect, even in adverse circumstances, we become more like Christ.&rdquo;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be an advocate for religious freedom and morality<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Be an advocate for religious freedom and morality. This is a time when those who feel accountable to God for their conduct feel under siege by a secular world. You understand the moral principles that are under attack and the need to defend morality. Religious freedom all over the world is also under attack. It is important for your generation to become well educated on this issue and assume responsibility for insuring that the religious freedom you have inherited is passed on to future generations. We must work together to both protect religious freedom and restore morality. Please understand this is not an effort to coerce religious belief. As John Locke asserted, religious worship does not have value unless it is voluntary.<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presidents of our Church including George Albert Smith, Gordon B. Hinckley, and Thomas S. Monson have made it clear that all religions hold truths, and that we should work together for the common good. In his inaugural press conference, President Monson emphasized this cooperation. He stated, &ldquo;We have a responsibility to be active in the communities where we live&hellip;and to work cooperatively with other churches&hellip;We need to eliminate the weakness of one standing alone and substitute for it the strength of people working together.&rdquo;<sup>20</sup> Our joint effort should be to protect important civic values like honesty, morality, self-restraint, respect for law, and basic human rights. An important study established, &ldquo;The association between religious freedoms and other civil liberties, press freedoms, and political freedoms are especially striking.&rdquo;<sup>21</sup> If we fail to diligently protect religious freedom we risk diminishing other important freedoms that are important both to us and to society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our challenge is to help people without religious faith understand that the protection of moral principles grounded in religion is a great benefit to society and that religious devotion is critical to public virtue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Founding Fathers including Washington and Madison pointed out that shared moral values espoused by different religions with competing doctrines allowed societies to be bound together.<sup>22</sup> In George Washington&rsquo;s farewell address as president of the U.S., he proclaimed that religion and morality are indispensable. He stated, &ldquo;Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education&hellip;, reason and experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.&rdquo; Unfortunately religious influence has often been replaced by so-called secular religions. &ldquo;For instance, humanism and atheism function as secular religions binding their adherents through common belief and ideology&hellip;.&rdquo;<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many philosophers have been at the forefront in promoting secularism and rejecting a moral view of the world based on Judeo/Christian values. In their view there is no &ldquo;objective moral order&rdquo; and no reason &ldquo;to choose one goal over another.&rdquo;<sup>24</sup> They believe no preference should be given to moral goals.<sup>25</sup> A British high court recently denied a Christian family the right to foster children because children could be infected with Christian moral beliefs. The ruling demonstrates just how radically things have shifted.<sup>26</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the reasons the attack on the moral or religious principles has been so successful is the reluctance of people of faith to express their views.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extraordinary effort will be required to protect religious liberty. Our doctrine confirms what both political philosophers and Founding Fathers advocated. Doctrine and Covenants 134:2 reads, &ldquo;&hellip;no government can exist in peace, except such laws are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience&hellip;&rdquo; Religious conscience is grounded in one&rsquo;s belief in being accountable to God for conduct. The effort of secularists or governments to coerce conduct in conflict with religious conscience leads to social disunity, and is a primary reason why religious liberty is essential for civil peace.<sup>28</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The role of religion in blessing a secular society was set forth succinctly by Alexis De Tocqueville in his classic Democracy in America.&nbsp; He stated, &ldquo;The greatest advantage of religion is to inspire&hellip;principles. There is no religion which does not place the object of man&rsquo;s desires above and beyond the treasure of earth, and which does not naturally raise his soul to regions far above those of the senses. Nor is there any which does not impose on man some sort of duties to his kind, and thus draws him at times from the contemplation of himself.&rdquo;<sup>29</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My challenge today<sup>30</sup> is that you join with people of all faiths who feel accountable to God in defending religious freedom so it can be a beacon for morality. We caution you to be civil and responsible as you defend religious liberty and moral values. We ask that you do this on the internet and in your personal interactions in the neighborhoods and communities where you live. Be an active participant, not a silent observer.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion our reason for undertaking the objectives <strong>to be an example</strong>, <strong>to be civil in our discourse</strong>, and <strong>to be an advocate for religious freedom</strong> is to serve mankind and follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. In doing so, our efforts will be blessed by Heaven and will further the purposes of this life established by a loving Father in Heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I congratulate you on your graduation achievement and pray that the Lord&rsquo;s most choice blessings will be yours.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>It is a privilege for me to be here with you and to be invited by Elder Cook to share a few thoughts. Graduation represents one of those grand inflection points in your lives; both a moment for looking forward with great anticipation (and perhaps a measure of anxiety) to what now lies ahead of you, as well as an opportunity for reflecting a little on the past while contemplating some of the lessons learned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the formal education you have received as a student at this remarkable university, you also are aware that many poignant lessons can be gained from a variety of common, ordinary experiences. These seemingly routine events come by way of the day-to-day learning laboratory of life. If you are observant and reflective regarding the people, things, and circumstances Heavenly Father has placed in the world around you, you will gain greater understanding of both the formal and the more common lessons and be able to apply them to various aspects of your lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I experienced an event many years ago that was quite simple, but gave me a greater appreciation for the importance of observing. Several applications can be gained from this lesson; let me just share the experience and you can garner any insights that may relate to your own situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I grew up in the East Bay in Northern California. Several of my friends and I enjoyed going skiing at Lake Tahoe whenever we could, which required a four-hour drive each way. We would pick a day when a group of us could go, leave early in the morning in order to arrive just as the lifts opened, ski hard all day until the lifts closed and then drive back that night. Unless there was a blizzard, we would not let weather deter us. We would ski in whatever conditions were present once we got to the mountains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our favorite places to ski was Heavenly Valley, on the south shore of Lake Tahoe. If we took two or three lifts, we could get near the top of the mountain and ski any one of several long trails with a vertical drop of up to 3,500 feet. At that time we were typical tempestuous teenagers and usually wanted to get in as many runs as possible, so we would jump off the lift and head down the mountain as quickly as we could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On one clear day, however, I remember getting off the lift and looking uphill towards the summit, a few hundred feet from the top of the lift. That day I took off my skis and climbed the short distance to the peak just to see what there was to see. Looking southward, the snow faded into the Nevada desert; looking northward there was beautiful Lake Tahoe surrounded by snow covered mountains and a forest of pine trees. The view was spectacular; the contrast was stark. I marveled at the beauty and diversity of God&rsquo;s creations. It had always been there to experience. All it took was a little extra effort to go a little higher and make it to the top of the peak to enjoy the grandeur of it all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout your life, a little extra effort at the right time in the right direction can yield remarkable rewards. As you reach for greater heights, remember the words of President Gordon B. Hinckley, who once stated, &ldquo;We stand on the summit of the ages&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> For you graduates, and probably for your parents, this graduation represents an historical moment atop an impressive educational summit. For many of you, this BYU-Idaho experience represents the pinnacle of your formal academic pursuits. However, don&rsquo;t let it be the end of your learning experiences. There is so much to learn, even from the common, ordinary events of our daily lives. And if you will pay attention, the &ldquo;Holy Ghost [will] teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance&hellip;&rdquo; <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before I offer a few remarks to the graduates, I would like to say a word to the parents. Thank you for entrusting your children to us. We love them very much. As I look at you today, I think of all the prayers you have said on behalf of your children. I think of all the home evenings and family dinners. I think of all the times you sat up waiting for them to come home. I think of your devotion to them and your love for them. We have seen that love and its fruits in your children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most wonderful things about your children is the Light of Christ in their eyes and His love in their hearts. It is true that they have worked hard at BYU-Idaho and have developed knowledge and skills that will be of great value to them and their families. Yet, what matters most is that they have become disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. They love the Lord, and His light and His love are in them. They will take that light and that love into a world in turmoil. Many in the world are lost or confused. Many seek a better life but do not know where or how to find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a dark and difficult world, good people will notice the light in your children; and they will feel the Savior&rsquo;s love through what your children do. Some of them will be neighbors or friends. Some of them will be people at work. Some of them may be ward members who have lost their way. Whoever they are, it is your children who will help them see Christ&rsquo;s light and feel His love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, to the graduates, I say: Be ready, brothers and sisters. Be ready to invite those people the Lord puts in your path to come unto Christ that they might feel the Savior&rsquo;s love and see the light of His gospel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a world that can be cold and harsh, feeling the Savior&rsquo;s love is like feeling the light of the sun break through the clouds, bringing warmth and goodness and life. In a world of turmoil, confusion, and darkness, seeing the light of the gospel is like seeing the sun come up over the Tetons, dispersing the darkness and bringing clarity, order, and beauty to life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can bring the light of truth to those around you by living the truth in your own life. You can help others feel the Savior&rsquo;s love by inviting them to come unto Him.&nbsp; What you share and what you are will illuminate lives because the light of truth, the Lord Jesus Christ, will shine in your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can help these good people to feel the Savior&rsquo;s love by loving them and serving them. As you act in faith to love and serve your brothers and sisters, the Lord will go with you.&nbsp; He will help you do and say what is just right for them. You will see Him work through you to touch their hearts by the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; They will feel Christ&rsquo;s redeeming love because His love is in your heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I close with my witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer. I have seen His light. I have felt His love. I know He lives.&nbsp; His Church and kingdom have been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith never to be taken from the earth again. We send you out into the world tonight with our love, our confidence, and our trust. You have a great work to do in the kingdom.&nbsp; May God bless you that the Light of Christ and His redeeming love may be in your eyes and in your hearts and in your lives this day and forever. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
