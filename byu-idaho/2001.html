<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">Brothers and sisters, welcome to a new semester and a new year at Ricks College.  This is an exciting time of transition and change, both for you as an individual and for this great institution.  Sister Bednar and I urge you to take full advantage of the spiritual and intellectual opportunities you will have to learn, to grow, and to develop.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">In the first devotional of the fall semester last year, I talked with you about the principle of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.  Today I will discuss the companion principle to faith in the Saviorthe principle of repentance.  I believe, brothers and sisters, this fundamental principle of repentance is one about which we talk frequently and little understand.</p>
<p align="left">The Saviors atonement simultaneously provides both a redeeming power that helps us to overcome sin and a strengthening power that helps us to become better disciples than we ever could be relying only upon our own strength.  Thus, the infinite and intimate atonement is for sinners and for saints.  The redeeming aspect of the atonement and the related principle of repentance are the primary topics of my message.  I pray for and invite the Holy Ghost to be with me and with you this afternoon as together we learn about these eternal and essential truths.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b><u>What is repentance?</u>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left">Let us begin by simply asking the question, What is repentance?  Elder Neal A. Maxwell describes repentance as . . . turning away from evil and turning to God . . .
      (<u>Ensign</u>, November 1991, p. 30).  And the Bible Dictionary (pp. 760-761) indicates that repentance is  . . . a turning of the heart and will to God, and a renunciation of sin . . . .  Now please note both the simplicity and the power of the word turning in these two statements.  Repentance is turning to God.  As we learn about and focus our faith in the Redeemer, then we instinctively and naturally turn toward and come unto Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Please turn with me in the Book of Mormon to the seventh chapter of Helaman.  In this chapter, Nephi, the son of Helaman, is warning of impending destruction and calling upon the people to repent.  We will begin reading in verse 16.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>O repent ye, repent ye!  Why will ye die?  Turn ye, turn ye unto the Lord your God. . . .&nbsp;</i>
</p>
<p>I now want to highlight two fundamental realities about the principle of repentance: (1) repentance requires the Redeemer, and (2) repentance requires an honest heart and real intent.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>#1  Repentance requires the Redeemer.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>The principles of faith in the Savior and repentance both flow from the doctrine of the atonement.  As President Ezra Taft Benson has explained:&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Repentance is the second fundamental principle of the gospel.  The first is that we must have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.  Why is this so?  Why must faith in the Lord precede true repentance?</i></p>
<p><i>To answer this question, we must understand something about the atoning sacrifice of the Master.  Lehi taught that . . . no flesh . . . can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah . . . (2 Nephi 2:8).  Even the most just and upright man cannot save himself solely on his own merits, for, as the Apostle Paul tells us, . . . all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23).</i></p>
<p><i>If it were not for the perfect, sinless life of the Savior, which He willingly laid down for us, there could be no remission of sins.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>Therefore, repentance means more than simply a reformation of behavior.  Many men and women in the world demonstrate great will-power and self-discipline in overcoming bad habits and the weaknesses of the flesh.  Yet at the same time they give no thought to the Master, sometimes even openly rejecting Him.  Such changes of behavior, even if in a positive direction, do not constitute true repentance.</i></p>
<p><i>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the foundation upon which sincere and meaningful repentance must be built.  If we truly seek to put away sin, we must first look to Him who is the Author of our salvation</i> (A Mighty Change of Heart, pp. 2-3 in
            <u>Repentance</u>, Deseret Book, 1990).&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Repentance means more than simply a reformation of behavior.  Many men and women in the  . . .
      [<b>Church </b>] . . . demonstrate great will-power and self-discipline in overcoming bad habits and the weaknesses of the flesh.  Yet at the same time they give no thought to the Master . . . .  Such changes of behavior, even if in a positive direction, do not constitute true repentance.</p>
<p>Recognizing and forsaking sin, feeling remorse and making restitution for sin, and confessing sins to God and, when needed, to our priesthood leaders, are all necessary and important elements in the repentance process.  However, these essential steps do not constitute a mere behavioral checklist we can mechanically, quickly, and casually complete.  If we do these things and fail to recognize and depend upon the Redeemer and His atoning sacrifice, then even our best efforts are in vain.  Remorse motivated only by personal embarrassment or social pressure is superficial.  Confession without contrition is shallow.  Restitution without a personal renewal and a true change of heart is hollow.  Turning away from evil without turning to Christ does not bring spiritual healing.  I must admit that I have sometimes wondered if we as members of the Church memorize the Rs of repentance, such as recognition, remorse, and restitution, and omit the most important R of allthe Redeemer.</p>
<p>One evening while I was serving as a stake president, I received a telephone call from an angry member of the Church who had just finished talking with his bishop.  This brother attended church sporadically and had not paid his tithing in many years.  Earlier the same evening this man had walked into the bishops office, rather matter-of-factly written out a check for his tithing, and then indicated that he wanted to obtain a temple recommend.  One of this mans children was to be married in the temple soon, and he wanted to attend the wedding.  As the bishop and the man had counseled together, it was clear the man believed that simply paying the money was all that was necessary to obtain a temple recommend.  This wise bishop had commended this brother for starting to pay his tithing; the bishop also told the man that they would talk about worthiness to worship in the temple when the man understood and had repented for the sin of disobedience.  The man was not pleased with this counsel from the bishop.  The man had said to his bishop, I wrote out the check.  What more do you want?  The bishop responded, My dear brother, writing a check is not repentance.  You must recognize and repent of your sin and change your heart.  The Lord requires your heart.  Following his conversation with the bishop, the man called me to complain about the treatment he had received from the bishop.  The man was even less pleased with my response.  I told him, Your bishop has counseled you correctly.  I advise you to heed his counsel and truly repent.</p>
<p>The Savior is often referred to as the Great Physician, and this title has major symbolic significance.  Brothers and sisters, all of us have experienced the pain associated with a physical injury or wound.  When we are in pain, we typically seek relief and are grateful for the medication and treatments that help to alleviate our suffering.  Now please consider sin as a spiritual wound that causes guilt or, as described by Alma to his son Corianton, remorse of conscience (Alma 42:18).  Pain is to our body what guilt is to our spirita warning of danger and a protection from additional damage.  From the atonement of the Savior flows the soothing salve that can heal our spiritual wounds and remove guilt.  However, this salve can only be applied through the principles of faith in the Lord and repentance.  The results of sincere repentance are peace, comfort, and spiritual healing and renewing.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the extent and intensity of our repentance must match the nature and severity of our sins.  Serious spiritual wounds take both time and assistance to heal completely and fully.  And the healing process itself can be painful.  As President Spencer W. Kimball has taught:</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, how grateful we should be as we read and ponder the scriptural promises that Christ</p>
<p>. . . shall rise from the dead, with <b>healing in his wings</b>; and all those who shall believe on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God . . .</p>
<p>And this healing power is real and available to each of us.  Please know and understand that it is available to you!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now want to emphasize one final point about repentance requiring the Redeemer.  We all understand that certain physical injuries or illnesses require the specialized care of a qualified health professional.  None of us here today would be foolish enough to undertake open-heart surgery on ourselves, and you and I would certainly not write our own prescriptions for potent medication.  For such surgical procedures and prescriptions, you and I need help.  In like manner, serious spiritual wounds can only be healed with the assistance of a properly authorized servant of the Lord.  A bishop is a commissioned representative of the Redeemer and a spiritual physician who can assist in the repentance and healing processes.  By virtue of his calling and ordination and the priesthood keys he received at the time of his setting apart, a bishop, as a common judge, can help diagnose spiritual illness and prescribe the necessary treatment and medication.</p>
<p>Some people falsely believe they can heal themselves from deep spiritual wounds, or that their serious sins can be kept between themselves and God.  And some people mistakenly postpone their repentance because they do not feel comfortable with or like the bishop to whom they have been assigned.  It is true that some bishops may seem easier to talk with than others.  Some bishops may appear to be more friendly and fun.  But, brothers and sisters, the personality or the popularity or the leadership style of a bishop does not really matter.  What does matter is a bishops priesthood keys and the authorization to receive revelation to assist those individuals within his ward who need spiritual help.  We do not shop around for or pick or choose a bishop who agrees with us or pleases us as we might select an ordinary consumer product; rather, we sustain and accept the authority of the bishop who presides over the ward in which we live and wherein our church membership record is retained.  Only he is authorized to represent the Redeemer in matters of spiritual illness and healing.</p>
<p>Repentance is possible because of the atonement of Jesus Christ.  Simply changing our behavior without relying upon Christ is not repentance.  Repentance is a principle that helps us know what we must do as disciples of the Master.  The atonement is the doctrine that helps us understand why we must have faith in the Savior and repent of our sins.  And this doctrine and these principles bring hope and provide peace for our souls.  I testify of the reality and of the power of the Saviors atoning sacrifice and of the blessings His offering makes available to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>#2  Repentance requires an honest heart and real intent.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>In the scriptures we find a powerful relationship among three important words: repent, intent, and heart.  Let us review together three verses from the Book of Mormon that highlight this important relationship, and please note how both intent and heart are linked to the repentance process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, please turn with me to 2 Nephi 31:13.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second scripture we want to examine is found in Mosiah chapter 4, verse 10.
		<blockquote>
<p><i>&gt;	And again, believe that ye must <b>repent of your sins</b> and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and
      		<b>ask in sincerity of heart</b> that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them</i> (emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>And finally, please turn with me to Moroni chapter 6, verse 8.

		<blockquote>
<p><i>But as oft as they <b>repented</b> and sought forgiveness, <b>with real
  intent</b>, they were forgiven</i> (emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>These verses clearly teach the importance of real intent and a sincere and an honest heart in the process of true repentance.
      	</p>
<p><i>&gt;	And again, believe that ye must <b>repent of your sins</b> and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and
      		<b>ask in sincerity of heart</b> that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them</i> (emphasis added).</p>
<p><i>But as oft as they <b>repented</b> and sought forgiveness, <b>with real
  intent</b>, they were forgiven</i> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>As we repent and turn to the Lord, it is important that we are honest with ourselves.  You and I must work to overcome the excuse making, the blaming, and the rationalizing that can divert us from the goal of turning unto the Lord.  As President Kimball has plainly taught:&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, brothers and sisters, as we repent and turn to the Lord, we must have real intent and be honest with Him whose forgiveness we seek.  That is, ours must be a full and complete and genuine confession to God, as well as to our bishop.  While our Heavenly Father obviously knows of our sinful actions, it is vital that we discuss our feelings extensively with Him.  Some people who lack understanding about the nature of repentance believe they can commit sin in a calculated and planned way, expecting that at the right time they can quickly and conveniently confess to the bishop and then continue along the strait and narrow path to the temple, to the mission field, and to other destinations.  My dear young brothers and sisters, I raise a voice of warning and plead with you with all of the energy of my soulplease do not be influenced or seduced by such false thinking.  Premeditated and planned prodigality (see Luke 15:11-32) brings an anguish of soul you cannot imagine.  How can you or I repent and seek forgiveness with real intent when in fact our real intent was to sin?  How can we turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart when our repentance is casual or superficial or timed to avoid public embarrassment?  Such scheming and dishonesty mock the atonement of Christ and constitute, in part, what is referred to in the scriptures as . . .<i> trampling under their feet the Holy One . .
      .</i> (Alma 5:53; Helaman 12:2).  Forgiveness from such sin is possible, but it is not obtained easily.</p>
<p>In Mark Twains <u>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</u>, Huck wrestles with issues of conscience and who he really is.  The following statement from Huckleberry teaches all of us an important lesson about real intent and being honest with ourselves and with the Lord, even though in the story Huck himself has not yet truly learned the lesson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I repeat once again these two fundamental realities about repentance: (1) repentance requires the Redeemer, and (2) repentance requires an honest heart and real intent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my service as a bishop and as a stake president, I worked with a number of young men and women who came to more fully appreciate and understand the atonement of Jesus Christ and the principle of repentance.  I recall one young man who had to repent and overcome some individual and personal weaknesses before he could worthily enter the temple to make sacred covenants and become a full-time missionary.  We counseled together on a number of occasions over a period of many months.  The anticipated dates for receiving his mission call and departing for the MTC came and went.  This young man had to face the awkwardness of people asking him why he had not yet received his call and left for his mission.  In one of our conversations this young man asked me why he had to wait so long?  Would it not be better, he asked, to overcome my personal weaknesses in the mission field and in the service of the Lord?  I responded: Service as a missionary is about teaching the restored gospel, bearing testimony, and inviting investigators to receive the ordinances of salvation.  You must have the companionship of the Holy Ghost to accomplish that work.  You certainly should not expect to be perfect before you can serve.  But you must overcome your particular, personal challenge if you are to be worthy of His spirit.  If you truly repent with real intent and a sincere heart, then as you make sacred covenants in the temple, as you enter the MTC, and as you serve in the mission field,
		<b>you will not have to wonder if you belong there!</b>  If you do not now learn how to repent properly, how can you possibly help your future investigators to repent?  Your repentance and the resulting forgiveness will bring a peace of mind that will enable you to serve with great faith and diligence and inspiration.  You deserve the spiritual assurance and confidence that come from true repentance.
    	<b>You will not have to wonder if you belong there!</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually this young man worthily did enter the House of the Lord.  He did enter the MTC, and he served as a valiant missionary.  After he had been in his assigned field of labor for about six months, he asked his mission president for permission to call me on the telephone.  The mission president permitted the call, and late one evening this elder and I had a wonderful conversation.  He joyfully told me about his investigators and his experiences in the mission field.  He expressed his appreciation for the atonement, and for the principle of repentance, and for the personal lessons he had learned.  As we concluded our conversation, he said, President, I am glad I had to wait.  I have never once wondered if I belong here.  Thank you for your help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what this young man did, you can do.  I want to emphasize that point in particular to those of you listening today who perhaps have concluded that you cannot or will not repent and turn unto the Lord.  What this young man did, you can do!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, there is great power in personal purity.  Please remember that preparing to avoid and preventing serious sin is always better than repeatedly repenting and repairing our lives.  Certainly we can be made clean; but as we recover from spiritual wounds, we, nonetheless, lose precious time that could have been devoted to being and doing good.  And though forgiveness indeed comes, the inescapable consequences of our sins are not erased by repentance and can last a long time, even a lifetime.  Thankfully, a loving Savior has provided a way for us to heal from spiritual wounds and illness by turning to and coming unto Him.</p>
<p>I conclude with a statement by President Ezra Taft Benson.</p>
<p>My prayer, brothers and sisters, is that you and I will not simply be members of record in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  May we repent with sincerity of heart and truly turn unto the Lord and come unto Him.  I testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and a living Savior.  His atoning sacrifice indeed redeems us from sin and strengthens us to do and be good.  He is real, He lives, and He loves each one of us.  I so witness in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">Welcome to the first devotional of 2001. 
		Speaking to you is a big responsibility that I don't take lightly. I 
		have prayed to be an instrument in the hands of the Lord this afternoon. 
		I ask for an interest in your prayers that I may be able to tell you the 
		thoughts and feelings that are in my heart.</p>
<p>For many months now I've been pondering about the word &quot;heart.&quot; One 
		of the first thoughts that popped into my mind was an experience I had 
		as a young girl. I'm sure many of you have had a similar experience. Go 
		back with me to your first or second grade classroom. You are sitting at 
		your desk with a pencil, a pair of scissors, and several squares of red 
		construction paper in front of you. With much care, you fold the paper 
		and then draw half of a heart along the fold. You are making Valentine 
		hearts to attach to a paper-covered shoe box that will house all the 
		special cards and treats you will receive from your classmates. Is this 
		memory vaguely familiar?</p>
<p>Not all the hearts you cut out are perfect. Some are long and skinny. 
		Others are a bit flat looking and somewhat misshapen. In fact, they look 
		more like dog ears than hearts. If you don't cut deep enough into the 
		top of the fold, some hearts turn out to be way too plump. About the 
		only way to create the ideal heart is to trace the teacher's perfect 
		pattern.</p>
<p>As you keep the shapes of these hearts in mind, I'd like to share 
		four experiences I've had with Ricks College students and relate these 
		situations to a parable from the New Testament. Though it is the parable 
		of the sower, it's really a parable about hearts. Seeds,which symbolize 
		the word of God, are sown into four different places--by the wayside, on 
		stony ground, in with thorns, and on good soil. The places where the 
		seeds fall represent the hearts of men. Some seeds grow, others don't 
		(see Matthew 13, Mark 4, Luke 8). The experiences I will share about 
		Ricks College students will illustrate how four students receive the 
		word of God into their hearts. As you will see, some harden their hearts 
		and cast the word aside while others seek with all their hearts to 
		follow the Master.</p>
<p align="center"><em><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">
		Experience #1</span></em></p>
<p>A caring student asked my suggestions one day of how she could help 
		her inactive sister. This sister had fallen away from the Church and 
		wanted nothing more to do with it. As the student explained her sister's 
		tragic situation, I simply said, &quot;I wish your sister could come to Ricks 
		College. This is such a great place for young people to gain a 
		testimony. I just know that would help.&quot; With a sad face the student 
		responded, &quot;Sister Bednar, my sister has been a student at Ricks 
		College.&quot;</p>
<p>A sower goes out to sow seed. Some seed falls by the wayside and is 
		eaten by the birds. Maybe the heart that is long and skinny could 
		represent this sister. She hears the word of God. But with no room in 
		her heart for the gospel, she allows Satan to take the word from her 
		heart, and she falls away.</p>
<p align="center"><em><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">
		Experience #2</span></em></p>
<p>A young woman sought out my husband and me in a large crowd of 
		people. Choking back the tears, she said, &quot;President and Sister Bednar, 
		I just want to tell you how much I love Ricks College. I haven't always 
		been able to say that because I got into some trouble while I was a 
		student at Ricks and was asked to leave. At that time I hated Ricks 
		College. I wandered down the wrong path for a couple of years, but I'm 
		attending institute classes where I live and am trying to come back into 
		activity. I know now what I didn't know then. Ricks College is a special 
		place.&quot;</p>
<p>A sower sows seed that lands in a stony place with little soil. When 
		the seed starts to sprout and grow, it is without root and is scorched 
		by the hot sun. The shallow, misshapen heart could represent this young 
		woman who doesn't let the word of God take deep root in her heart. When 
		the heat of temptation comes, she makes poor choices and turns her heart 
		from the gospel.</p>
<p><em><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Experience #3</span></em></p>
<p>In a misguided debate about R-rated movies, a young man on our campus 
		wrote:</p>
<p>I am 22 years old, a returned missionary, and I watch R-rated 
			movies. To be honest, I don't plan on not watching them anytime 
			soon.</p>
<p>Why do students feel it necessary to preach hellfire and 
			damnation to those of us who do watch these movies? For the most 
			part, we are all responsible adults. Some . . . have essentially 
			called me and other students sinners.</p>
<p>I do not believe I will burn in hell for watching R-rated movies, 
			and I don't think anyone else will, either. I respect what the 
			prophets say about the subject, but it is still my choice and I am 
			willing to take responsibility for it.</p>
<p>A sower goes out to sow seeds. Some fall on ground where they are 
		choked out by thorns and become unfruitful. Perhaps the plump heart 
		could represent this returned missionary who is puffed up in an attitude 
		of pride and distracted by worldly pleasures.</p>
<p align="center"><em><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">
		Experience #4</span></em></p>
<p>A concerned young woman came to me after a meeting and tearfully 
		shared her troubles. It was evident after a few moments of listening 
		that this student had many anxieties. She had difficulties at home, 
		problems in her classes, and lacked any feeling of worth. I struggled to 
		find the right words to encourage her. As we parted, I noticed one of 
		her roommates had been waiting for her in the hall nearby. This loving 
		roommate put her arm around the shoulder of this anxious young woman and 
		together they walked back to their apartment. I admired the love of that 
		roommate. Certainly, living with this distressed young woman would not 
		have been easy. But she desperately needed and deserved the unselfish 
		love of a caring roommate.</p>
<p>A sower goes out to sow seed. Some seeds fall on good ground, grow 
		well, and bring forth fruit. Perhaps the heart you traced from your 
		teacher's pattern could represent this loving roommate who hears the 
		word of God, patterns her life after the teachings of Jesus, and does 
		good works.</p>
<p>We, too, can follow this pattern. All hearts can be changed. A heart 
		that turns away from the gospel need only exercise a particle of faith 
		for the Savior's word to start growing again. A hard and shallow heart 
		can remove the stones of hatred, rebellion, and defiance and replace 
		them with the soil of soft, sincere pleadings for forgiveness. The heart 
		puffed up in pride can weed out the thorns of worldly lusts and 
		enticements and replace them with a desire to follow the counsel of 
		living prophets. A heart patterned after the Savior can continue to 
		bring forth works of righteousness. We can all yield our hearts to God 
		if we have the courage and the desire to make necessary changes.</p>
<p>There is one more heart I would like to discuss today. Please come 
		back with me again to your elementary classroom. Perhaps you aren't 
		listening carefully to the instructions of your teacher when she 
		explains how to cut your paper heart. Maybe you are daydreaming about 
		the Valentine that you might receive from the handsome little boy or 
		cute girl who sits across the aisle from you. Not thinking, you cut your 
		heart on the open edges of the paper and are surprised to find your 
		heart is not joined in the middle, but consists of two halves. This 
		heart needs some tape from your teacher to hold it together.</p>
<p>The scriptures refer to this particular heart as a broken heart. We 
		are commanded to offer for our sacrifice unto the Lord in righteousness 
		a broken heart and a contrite spirit (see D&amp;C 59:8). A broken heart is 
		one that is humble and easily led. It sets aside pride and selfish 
		ambition to follow Jesus. It recognizes a dependence upon and a need for 
		the Savior's atonement.</p>
<p>In closing, I testify that just as the tape of our teacher could mend 
		our paper hearts, the tender tape of the Savior's mercy can mend and 
		heal our spiritual hearts. Christ knows our desires and intent as we try 
		earnestly to improve and seek for a mighty change of heart. He stands at 
		the door and knocks. All we have to do is open our hearts and let him 
		enter, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

    years ago, two of my teenage friends and I decided to take a drive into the mountains to a
    place where several small lakes collected melted snow in the spring to water thirsty
    summer crops in the valley below. We decided to drive in an old car which had been parked
    for sometime and had long ago exhausted its usefulness. We put gasoline in it, checked the
    radiator and oil, and by pulling it with a tractor, finally got it started, and we were on
    our way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We
    soon realized why the car had been abandoned. The steep hills were more than it could
    easily negotiate, and frequently it stalled before reaching the top. When this occurred,
    we backed down the hill and up the one behind us. Then with a roar of the engine and all
    the encouragement three teenagers could muster, the old car pushed up the hill, over the
    top, and down the other side.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We
    soon reached the crest of a tall hill -- the last obstacle that stood between us and our
    destination. We opened the gate and looked down -- way down. The road was steep, much
    steeper than we anticipated. Still, we felt invincible, and although we were miles from
    home, no one wanted to mention or think about whether or not the car had the power to
    return up the hill.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We had
    set our minds upon enjoying ourselves at the lakes. The possibility of not being able to
    get back was far from our minds, so we drove through the gate and down the steep hill. The
    car engine revved up as it held back the car's descent to the lakes. We felt the quick
    drop in the pit of our stomachs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We
    enjoyed this beautiful place, the scenery, skipping rocks on the lake, and the simple joy
    of life and living. As the sun began to lower in the sky, we knew it was time to go home.
    We looked up the hill, which seemed even steeper now. There was only a short distance from
    the edge of the lake to the point where the road began a steep angle upwards.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We
    piled in and started up the hill. We only made it part way -- not nearly far enough. We
    tried again and again. It was only then that the consequence of our earlier decision began
    to rest squarely on us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We
    were not really concerned about our safety. We could sleep in the car that evening, and
    even if our tee shirts didn't keep us very warm, we would survive and walk out the next
    day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We
    tried practically everything. Each new effort seemed to propel us a little farther up the
    hill.&nbsp; Perhaps, we thought, if we could muster one more major effort and have
    everything work right for us, we could make it out</span>.<span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We
    cleared away brush near the lake to provide more distance to make our run. We removed
    rocks and debris from the road, and two of us stationed ourselves part way up the hill to
    push when the car reached its limits. One last chance! With the gas pedal to the floor,
    the old car fishtailed up the road, and as it slowed down, two teenage boys with arms
    under the rear bumper and faces squashed against the trunk pushed with all their might, as
    rocks spun from the wheels and stung their hands, arms, and legs</span>.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>Finally,
    we reached the top and were on our way home, a little wiser and armed with a life-long
    reminder that while we are free at any given time to make choices, we do not choose the
    consequences of the decisions we make.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>Choices
    now will affect who and what we are in the future. Agency is as basic as life itself and
    cannot be taken from us. Even in the most dire and difficult circumstances, we may still
    choose our course. Viktor Frankl, a Jewish psychiatrist, was a prisoner during World War
    II. He suffered greatly and experienced the loss of most of his freedoms. However, he came
    to believe that even though freedom may be greatly restricted, agency, or the power to
    choose at any moment in time, remains with us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>You
    cannot always choose to be whatever you please. Sometimes there are restrictions on the
    choices we can make. For example, an individual who is short, not very coordinated, and
    slow has the agency to try out for a professional basketball team. However, his particular
    physical characteristics may restrict his opportunity to make the team. Agency, or the
    power to choose, is a constant, while the range of choices or opportunity to make choices
    may vary.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>As
    students, your choice to study, learn, and master a body of knowledge will significantly
    increase your range of choices after you graduate. Your choice of employment, where you
    live, what you do, your salary, and your availability for service will be affected by the
    choices you make now.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"> <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>Sometimes
    we take the gift of agency for granted because making choices is so much a part of all we
    do. However, we should never forget the heart-rending and terrible price paid in the world
    before this one to preserve our agency.</span></p>
<p>&quot;. . because, Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man
      which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own
      power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down&quot;
      (Moses 4:3). </p>
<p>&quot;. . . a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their
      agency; And they were thrust down, and thus came the devil and his angels&quot; (Doctrine
      and Covenants 29:36-37).</p>
<p><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We can better understand
    the importance Heavenly Father placed on agency if we consider how we would feel if one
    third of our brothers, sisters, or other family members rejected our beliefs and were lost
    to us forever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">We
    learn that agency is an essential element of our eternal existence. As intelligent beings,
    the Lord said of us, &quot;all intelligence is independent in the sphere in which God has
    placed it, to act for itself, otherwise there is no existence&quot; (Doctrine and
    Covenants 93:30). </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">It
    wasn't just that Satan's plan was second best -- more importantly, it simply could never
    work. There is no existence without agency.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Nephi
    clearly teaches that men are &quot;free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for
    themselves and not to be acted upon&quot; (2 Nephi 2:26).&nbsp; The Lord states also in
    the Doctrine and Covenants that &quot;the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto
    themselves&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants 58:28).</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">The
    power to choose is within each of us, and nothing can take it from us. We have the power
    to choose our course in life -- to choose good or evil when the choice is placed before
    us.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Satan
    will do everything he possibly can to deceive you. He wants you to make choices that
    diminish your desire to choose righteousness, in hopes that you will eventually become his
    servant.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Several
    years ago, I was asked to visit with a man who came to Church headquarters to visit with a
    General Authority. The story he related was sad and tragic. When he was a young boy, he
    was sexually abused by an older man. This experience spawned in him a desire for
    additional experiences. He had followed the temptation of an escalating desire for sexual
    sin. Now more than thirty years later, he described himself as being in the &quot;bonds of
    iniquity,&quot; and &quot;bound by the chains of hell,&quot; as described by Alma.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">In
    total self-disgust, he declared that he must either stop his sinful behavior or end his
    life. I knew that he meant what he said. I could see it in his eyes and hear it in his
    voice. I knew that if he did not feel hope that he might someday soon take his own life.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">He had
    come to believe that he could not cease his sick and senseless behavior.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">His
    days were consumed with bad thoughts and immoral experiences. He claimed he had lost his
    willpower and that he was addicted to sin and could not change. He had tried many times
    but felt himself powerless against the forces which he had willingly chosen earlier in his
    life.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I
    sensed that, along with the professional advice I might offer him, more than anything else
    he needed the knowledge and hope that comes from understanding the Savior and His
    power to help even the most discouraged person. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">We
    talked of the power of the atonement. &quot;. . . the Son of God suffereth according to
    the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their
    transgressions according to the power of his deliverance. . ., &quot; (Alma 7:13) and
    &quot;. . . that he has all power to save every man that believeth in his name and
    bringeth forth fruit meet for repentance. . . .&quot; (Alma 12:15).</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">We
    reviewed the experience of Alma and his followers who were taken into bondage by the
    Lamanites and were delivered miraculously from their power. This experience was used as an
    example many times for how others were and can be delivered from their bondage, including
    spiritual bondage -- the bondage of sin, if you will. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Alma
    said, &quot;But behold, he did deliver them because they did humble themselves before him;
    and because they cried mightily unto him he did deliver them out of bondage; and
    thus doth the Lord work with his power in all cases among the children of men, extending
    the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him&quot; (Mosiah
    29:20). </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I
    challenged his beliefs that he no longer had the will power to choose the right and that
    he must now succumb to temptation. To illustrate, I asked him what he would do if someone
    he respected entered the room during one of his immoral episodes. After only a
    brief moment as he thought about my question, he indicated that he indeed would stop
    immediately if this were to occur. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">As we
    talked about this, he realized that he did have the power and agency to make the right
    choices, but his desire to do so was greatly lacking because of his continual sin.
    Individuals suffering even from the strongest addictions still have the agency and power
    to choose righteousness, however, their desires increasingly diminish with a continuation
    of sin. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Every
    act of disobedience takes away light and truth and gives Satan more power over us.
    &quot;And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience. .
    . .&quot;(Doctrine and Covenants 93:39).</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">In a
    vision of the world and its future inhabitants, Enoch saw &quot;. . . generation upon
    generation; and Enoch was high and lifted up, even in the bosom of the Father, and of the
    Son of Man; and behold, the power of Satan was upon all the face of the earth&quot; (Moses
    7:24).</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&quot;And
    he beheld Satan; and he had a great chain in his hand, and it veiled the whole face of the
    earth with darkness; and he looked up and laughed, and his angels rejoiced&quot; (Moses
    7:26).</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">This
    great chain was symbolic of the slavery or, as Alma describes, the &quot;chains of
    hell&quot; that bind those who choose evil rather than good. As one makes these wrong
    choices, his power and desire to choose righteously is diminished and the time may come
    when &quot;. . . they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to
    destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell&quot; (Alma 12:11). 		</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">One
    way men and women gain more desire and power to make correct choices is through obedience
    to God's commandments. &quot;He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light. .
    .&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants 93: 28) and &quot;light and truth forsake that evil
    one&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants 93:37).</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">While this man had much more to do to repent and straighten out
    his life, he at least gained hope and a better understanding of God's power to help him
    and his own ability to begin to make the right choices. Understanding this truth gave him
    hope. It empowered him with the hope of change, even though the road ahead was still very
    difficult.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Learn
    to trust your feelings and to choose accordingly. If you feel uncomfortable in a
    situation, it is probably the Holy Ghost prompting you to remedy the situation or choose
    to leave. Do not let your fear of what others think overcome your faith in the promptings
    of the Spirit. The Lord will warn His
    children about danger as they are willing to listen and to act. Practice by turning off
    the television or responding appropriately when you feel that what you are doing or
    viewing is not right.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Each
    time you exercise your agency and will to make correct choices, even in small things, you
    gain more light and truth and are more able to make the right choice with even greater
    temptations and challenges.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">While
    each problem must receive careful attention and effort, we should remember that
    every time we pray, study the word of God, fast, contribute tithing and fast offerings, or
    perform any act of service -- our power to make other more difficult choices increases. 		</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Those
    who learn to exercise self-control and self-discipline learn to make choices as far away
    from the temptation as possible. It is easier to choose not to enter a bar or pub than it
    is to avoid drinking a bottle of alcohol already held to our lips. It is easier to avoid
    pornography if we never enter an establishment where it is sold.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Some
    feel they don't have the power to choose -- that their particular temptation or situation
    is beyond their ability to control. Joseph Smith &quot;observed that Satan was generally
    blamed for the evils which we did, but if he was the cause of all our wickedness, men
    could not be condemned. The devil could not compel mankind to do evil; all
    was voluntary. God would not exert any compulsory means, and the devil could
    not.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">To
    underscore that sin and wrong choices are not passive but an active choice on
    our
    part, he continues. &quot;Those who resist the Spirit of God, would be liable to be led
    into temptation, and then the association of heaven would be withdrawn from those who
    refused to be made partakers of such great glory.&quot; </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">It is
    helpful to remember that when faced with a wrong choice, the Holy Ghost will prompt us to
    do right. To partake of sin, we must first resist or reject the Spirit, then partake of
    the sin.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Sometimes
    individuals are unwilling to use their agency and power to make decisions for themselves.
    They want someone else to choose for them. Some seek answers from the Lord, hoping He will
    tell them every small thing they should do. They are unwilling to think and act for
    themselves. While every person should seek guidance from the Holy Ghost, the Lord also
    expects us to use our minds and to think for ourselves.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Your
    mind is a gift from God and a source of revelation. The Lord gives you power to think and
    reason. Have you wondered how Moses knew what to do to help the Israelites escape
    from the Egyptians who were coming to destroy them? The scriptures say &quot;I will tell
    you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost . . . this is the Spirit of
    revelation; behold this is the Spirit by which Moses brought the children of Israel
    through the Red Sea on dry ground&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants 8:2-3).</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">The
    process of thinking, reasoning, using our minds, and communicating is a significant and
    important source of revelation. The Holy Ghost often provides the second witness, or
    burning within, as a second and sure witness to confirm our initial thinking and
    reasoning.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">In
    1856, Brigham Young told Church members: &quot;If I ask (God) to give me wisdom concerning
    any requirement in life, or in regard to my own course, or that of my friends, my family,
    my children, or those I preside over, and get no answer from him, and then do the very
    best that my judgment will teach me, he is bound to own and honor that transaction and he
    will do so for all intents and purposes.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">We
    should also seek counsel and advice from those whom we trust, love, and respect. Listening
    to those who are in a position of authority or who have had experience beyond ours or who
    know the dangers we may face will help us choose wisely.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Two
    young married couples discovered this important principle as they traveled to Mexico on a
    vacation. Searching for a beach which was not crowded with too many people, they stopped
    at one resort but could hardly find even a place to sit on the crowded beach. They decided
    to drive further south to look for a better place. As they drove into a small village,
    they were delighted to see the warm Pacific waters in a beautiful, quiet bay near the edge
    of the town.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Only a
    few local residents were near the water's edge. These young couples would have this
    beautiful vacation spot mostly to themselves.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">As
    they dressed in their swimming suits and approached the water, several citizens tried to
    caution them, but these young people were thinking of the beautiful warm Pacific waters.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">These
    were not disobedient young people; they simply did not listen carefully to those who knew
    more about the location they chose for swimming.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">They
    waded into the bay. The water was warm, gentle, and quiet. They felt fortunate that, for
    some strange reason, no one else in the world seemed to have discovered this beautiful
    paradise.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">After
    a short time in the water, one of the young women took a step out into the bay. As she
    placed her foot forward into the sand, she at first felt a distinct movement.
    Frightened, she tried to jump back, but before she could, she felt the very painful
    penetration of the tail of a stingray deep into her foot. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I am
    told firsthand by the two young women, who ran as fast as they could to shore, that both
    of their husbands passed them up, going the same direction.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Several
    of the natives came over to see if they could help. They explained what they well
    knew and what these young people could have learned from them had they taken time to
    listen. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">This
    particular bay was free from ocean waves. The stingrays would come into this calm water,
    settle on the sandy bottom, shake and wiggle themselves until a light layer of sand
    settled over them, and there they stayed to sun themselves. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Had
    these young couples listened to the warnings the local, more experienced people tried to
    provide, they would have prevented a painful injury that took sometime to heal.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Seek
    advice from your parents. Listen to them. They certainly aren't perfect, but most of them
    spend a great deal of time on their knees asking God to give them wisdom, strength, and
    the ability to be good parents.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">We
    live in a litigious society. Often we hear of lawsuits against organizations and
    institutions for the misdeeds of people affiliated with them. Such activity suggests
    that groups somehow govern the decisions or actions of these individuals, and they are not
    free to make choices for themselves. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Some
    individuals and even some groups blame their problems of today on injustices committed
    generations ago. They seek apologies or recovery from those who live today who had
    nothing to do with unfortunate incidents of the past. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Some
    believe that they cannot resolve the anguish they feel today because of wrongs inflicted
    upon their ancestors years ago. They wait for someone to deliver them from their
    unpleasant circumstances. By so doing, they rob themselves of the right and responsibility
    to make decisions that will improve their condition and exercise their faith.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Terms
    such as &quot;road rage&quot; suggest that those who have it have contracted some illness
    over which they have no control. Whatever happened to old-fashioned self-control,
    self-discipline, or just the simple words, &quot;grow up?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I have
    found no easy explanation to Moroni's soul-searching, sobering words, <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>&quot;. . . deny yourselves of all
    ungodliness . . . then is his grace sufficient for you&quot; (Moroni 10:32).&nbsp; These
    words suggest no shift of responsibility to someone else, no excuses, no magical way out,
    no shifting the burden to others, no blaming some biological, genetic, or addictive reason
    for wrong behavior. There is only the straightforward admonition to &quot;deny ourselves
    of all ungodliness.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">We
    should also be careful about labeling people as homosexual, abusers, alcoholics, or other
    such labels because labels often subtly imply an identity or disease over which there is
    no longer personal control or responsibility and which may cause someone to lose
    hope that they can make choices to stop inappropriate behavior and change their lives.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Recently
    progress has been made to better understand some of the emotional problems with which
    individuals struggle. Continued research will undoubtedly help us better understand the
    relationship between biology and genetics and our mental and behavioral well-being.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">However,
    as we learn more about these important matters, we should be careful to assume
    responsibility for decisions which we can and do make and the consequences of them. We
    should make certain that we do not attempt to transfer the responsibility and
    accountability of decisions we make to a biologic and genetic cause when doing so is not
    justified and tends to erode our power to be in control of our lives. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">To the
    degree that we wrongly suggest that people's problems are genetically based, caused by
    chemical imbalance, their parents, the environment, or something other than themselves, we
    rob them of the power to be in charge of their lives and change.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I bear
    witness that people can change -- even those who may believe at first that they are
    helpless to stop their sinful behavior. I have seen the faithful and prayerful break the
    bonds of passion, habit, and addiction. I have witnessed chains of sin, dependency,
    and vice shattered by humble souls who open their hearts and minds to the healing
    influence of the Savior. Even the most sinful person can cease wrong behavior and choose
    the right course.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Alex
    Haley, author of Roots, tells the story about a man named John Newton, born in London,
    England, July 24, 1725, to an authoritarian father and a loving, pious, shy mother -- to
    John's relief, his father was a sailor who was home only a few weeks between long voyages.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">When
    John was seven years old, his mother died. This was a devastating loss to him, and
    he became rebellious, stubborn, and disrespectful. At age 11, he became an apprentice
    sailor on his father's ship. While there, he strayed even further from his mother's
    teachings. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Looking
    back on these days, John said of himself, &quot;I believe for some years I never was an
    hour in any company without attempting to corrupt them.&quot; His wayward and sinful life
    continued as he became a slave trader, indulging his sexual appetite at will with the
    slaves.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">In
    1748, after years as a &quot;militant atheist&quot; Newton was on a ship named the
    Greyhound, and seeking something to do, he came across a book named The Imitation of
    Christ which, among other things, warned of God's judgment of sinners. After reading it,
    he flung the book aside. But early the next morning a terrible storm nearly capsized his
    ship. After pumping water for hours and beginning to lose hope, Newton surprised himself
    by crying out, &quot;If this will not do, the Lord have mercy upon us.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">After
    this experience, Newton began a turn to God and goodness. He became a powerful preacher in
    Liverpool, England; his growing flock captivated by stories of his life, the sea, and the
    goodness of God in forgiving sinners who repented and turned to Him.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">When
    Newton was over 80-years of age, he joined with William Wilberforce, a young member of
    parliament, in an attempt to abolish the slave trade on British ships. With Newton's
    firsthand experience with the slave trade and the position and energy of Wilberforce,
    these two were able to accomplish this commendable feat.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Newton
    soon thereafter died and was buried in the churchyard where he preached.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">He
    wrote the following inscription of himself to mark his place of burial. &quot;John Newton,
    clerk, once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa, was by the rich mercy
    of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ preserved, restored, pardoned, and appointed to preach
    the faith he long labored to destroy.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Alex
    Haley, researcher and author of this story, closes the article with these words:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&quot;My
    research brought me to St. Mary Woolnoth. I stood on the very rostrum where the Reverend
    John Newton had held his congregation spellbound with stories of the sea, his sins, and
    God's great mercy. As I looked out over the empty pews, the organist played the melodies
    of hymns Newton had written. One glorious tune swelled up all around me. The verses were
    written at Olney -- a minor autobiographical lyric that critics say is a poor example of
    Newton's work. But that hymn has traveled the world, bringing a message of hope and
    forgiveness to all people of faith.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&quot;I
    sang to myself the simple words I had learned as a child in a black church in the American
    South. You know them too:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" align="center"><i>Amazing Grace -- how sweet the Sound<br />That saved a wretch like me!<br />I once was lost, 		<br />but now am Found,<br />Was blind,<br />but now I see.&quot;</i><br /></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><br />Long will I remember that warm sunny afternoon driving into the mountains with my friends.
    The lesson we learned was important to remember. Yes, we have the power to choose our
    course in life. We must accept the consequences of what we choose. When your challenges
    are difficult and your burdens hard to bear, remember this: God will never forsake you nor
    forget you. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Alma
    the younger, who knew something about overcoming serious challenges, including sin, taught
    us something about God's desire and willingness to help. After describing the pains he
    felt for his sins, he said, &quot;Never, until I did cry out for mercy, . . . did I find
    peace to my soul<span>&quot; (Alma 38:8)</span>.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&quot;.
    . . I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their
    trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last
    day&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> (Alma 36:3)<span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>&nbsp; and, &quot;. . . as
    much as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of
    your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions&quot; (Alma 38:5). </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I bear
    witness of the truthfulness of the gospel, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p align="left">There are many examples of people of integrity (and some who lack it) in
    modern times. May I illustrate from my own observations related to the business world? See
    if you can see what lessons we might glean from them. </p>
<p align="left">I recently attended the funeral of my friend Lowell Benson, Executive Vice
    President of the O.C. Tanner Company and their chief buyer of diamonds and gold. He was
    also a stake president in Salt Lake City and a great friend and graduate of BYU and the
    Marriott School of Management. His funeral packed a large stake center. I was curious to
    see that people attended from the diamond capitals of the world: Antwerp and Johannesburg.
    Their messages were read at the funeral. I paraphrase, &quot;We knew Lowell as an
    excellent man of business. More importantly, he was a man of integrity. He drove a hard
    bargain but he could always be trusted to keep his word.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Jon Huntsman, Sr., is one of the most successful businessmen in America.
    (His corporate jet enables President Hinckley to travel the world.) He has founded a
    number of companies in the republics of the former Soviet Union. Two of his former
    employees were in my MBA class at BYU and told me of the box factory he created in Russia
    to help this emerging economy. Initially the company was told it would have to pay a
    certain tax rate on boxes sold to Russian customers and a much lower rate on boxes shipped
    for resale to other former republics. After the company started producing boxes, a tax
    administrator came and informed the company that the rates were being increased on the
    exported boxes--to a point that made the company completely unprofitable. However, the
    official said, if certain amounts could be paid under the table directly to the tax
    official, he could &quot;take care of them.&quot; It is Jon Huntsman's policy never to pay
    a bribe. He never has, he never will. The official was insistent. Jon Huntsman decided to
    sell the factory to local management for one dollar rather than pay a bribe. He lost his
    investment of millions of dollars but he would not compromise his integrity for money.</p>
<p align="left">Recently one of our top BYU MBA graduates accepted one of the most
    lucrative jobs of the year with a prestigious company. He and his wife moved to a large
    city and were enjoying the prospects of a rapid move up the success ladder. But he was
    asked to engage in business practices that compromised his integrity. His supervisor
    wanted him to make significant misrepresentations to customers. He approached his
    superiors and told them he could not do what they were asking him to do. He was fired. He
    spent several months out of work. Fortunately, he finally did get another very good
    job--even better than the first. </p>
<p align="left">An accounting clerk at a large university became a respected member of his
    profession--even holding a high office in his professional association. He was active in
    his church and community and had a good family. One day he discovered how he could take
    small amounts from the university without anyone noticing. He told himself that he was
    underpaid anyway--and besides, he would only use the money a short while and then return
    it. But the next month, more money was needed. Just a little more would not matter--he'd
    pay that back, too. The months stretched into years. The total amount taken swelled to
    several hundred thousand dollars. Then came the day when an audit uncovered his fraud. His
    reputation was shattered. His career came to an end. His family disintegrated. Ties with
    his church were broken. Where once he was a respected member of the community, now he was
    a common criminal unworthy of the trust and confidence of any employer.</p>
<p align="left">Two partners in an e-commerce start-up company negotiated a contract with
    a large company to provide their customers seminars on this new field. The large firm
    provided seed money to help the small company get started. A few months later, the
    partners realized that, under the terms of the contract, they owed the large company about
    $40,000. If that amount had to be paid immediately, the small company would have to shut
    its doors. The original intent of the contract would not have required payment, but the
    wording of the contract was such that the small firm owed the $40,000. At the same time
    this was discovered, the large company changed the manager who was responsible for the
    contract. He probably did not know of the contents of the contract nor of the intent. The
    two partners had a choice--if they told the new manager about the $40,000, they could have
    to pay it and lose their company. If they did not tell him, the new manager may never find
    out and they could stay in business. The partners said to each other, &quot;It's only
    money. We built our company on the principles of integrity. We can't let money stand in
    the way of that principle.&quot; They called the new manager and explained the situation.
    He asked for a few days to consider the matter. He later called back and said, &quot;You
    have been men of integrity. We find that a rare commodity in today's business. Because we
    now know we can trust you, we want you to keep the $40,000.&quot; That year, the small
    company did over one million dollars in business with the large company and the
    relationship continued at that level for many years.</p>
<p align="left">A father was preparing his taxes late one night. He had assembled all the
    appropriate records and worked hard to determine what he owed the IRS--never the most
    joyful experience in life. When all was computed, he found that he qualified for a small
    refund. But then he suddenly remembered a transaction. He had been paid for one fairly
    large job in cash. No records were made of the transaction. He realized that the IRS
    couldn't have received a report of this income and likely would never know about it.
    Reporting it would cost him over $1,000 in state and federal taxes--a sizeable amount to
    his young and growing family. But then he thought, &quot;I am a man of integrity. This is
    a small price to pay for resting well at night knowing I have been honest.&quot; He had to
    take out a short-term loan from the bank but he paid the extra taxes and slept well.</p>
<p align="left">Now, what can we learn about integrity from these stories? You probably
    drew your own conclusions. Let me suggest a few of mine. First, integrity usually extracts
    a price. To be a person of integrity we must be willing to pay that price. It cost Jon
    Huntsman literally millions of dollars. It cost the MBA student his job. Neither had any
    hope of monetary reward for living with integrity. </p>
<p align="left">Second, living with integrity may bring recognition from the world--but
    not necessarily. People came from Belgium and South Africa to honor Lowell Benson for his
    life of integrity. The start-up company was rewarded with millions in revenues because
    they established a relationship of integrity with a customer. A recruiter told me the
    other day that his firm came to BYU to find employees because he knew they were
    well-trained and had integrity. But worldly recognition is not necessarily the case nor
    should it be expected. The young father was not rewarded with public acclaim but with a
    clear conscience, peace of mind and a good night's sleep. </p>
<p align="left">Third, the decision to live with integrity is not always the easiest path
    to follow--especially if one measures decisions by worldly standards. The MBA student's
    decision to leave a prestigious firm over an issue some might consider &quot;just
    business&quot; would not have been considered wise by worldly career consultants.
    Sometimes living with integrity bring pain.</p>
<p align="left">Fourth, people generally don't set out to intentionally lose their
    integrity. Loss of integrity comes usually very slowly, a small step at a time. The
    accountant did not intend to defraud his employer, only to be &quot;fairly
    compensated.&quot; He just took a little at first. He always intended to pay it back. He
    never considered himself a &quot;bad man&quot; or one who lacked integrity.</p>
<p align="left">Fifth, loss of integrity can bring devastating consequences that go far
    beyond the incident where integrity is compromised. The accountant lost everything he
    valued: his family, his church, his career, his respect in the community, his friends and,
    for a time, his freedom.</p>
<p align="left">Think of the ills in our society caused by a lack of integrity. Families
    are torn apart when a husband or wife lacks integrity in upholding marriage covenants.
    Children become alienated from parents when there is lack of integrity in the family unit.
    	</p>
<p align="left">Countries are destroyed when law enforcement officials lack integrity in
    upholding laws. We recently sponsored a student from Armenia, one of the former republics
    of the Soviet Union. She was amazed when we told her if she ever needed help, she could
    ask a policeman to assist her. &quot;In my country,&quot; she said, &quot;one would not
    dare go to a policeman for help. No one trusts the police. They take bribes. They might
    harm you before they would help.&quot; The lack of integrity in this country has almost
    brought commerce to a standstill. </p>
<p align="left">Think of the billions lost each year in the retail trade in the U.S. due
    to shoplifting. It is a sad note that for most retailers, the majority of their losses
    come from employees rather than dishonest customers.</p>
<p align="left">And think of further billions in aid that is sent to underdeveloped
    countries in Africa and elsewhere. What a tragedy that such a high percentage is siphoned
    off by corrupt political leaders rather than benefiting the people who so desperately need
    this assistance</p>
<p align="left">Now we may not be able to exert much influence on some of these very large
    problems--but we can start by changing ourselves and maybe, just maybe, that will help the
    world be a little bit better. </p>
<p align="left">How can we become or continue to be people of integrity? I suggest to you
    a principle borrowed from an investment expert, Alan Folkman of Oregon who was our most
    recent Distinguished Alumnus in the Marriott School of Management. </p>
<p align="left">It is said that Albert Einstein called this principle &quot;one of the
    most powerful forces in the universe.&quot; The principle I am speaking of is compound
    interest. Here's an example of it. Did you know that if you started saving $200 a month
    from the time you start work at age 25 and continue until age 70, you will have
    accumulated over $1,000,000 (at 8 percent). Now you really only put aside a little over
    $100,000. Where did the rest come from? Interest on the first $200, then interest on the
    second $200 plus more interest on the first $200, etc.</p>
<p align="left">Further do you know what happens of if you delay the start of that savings
    until age 45? Now you're saving more than half the time of the first example but you only
    end up with $200,000 in the end--1/5 the amount. Why? Much less interest on interest
    because of the shorter time.</p>
<p align="left">Another example, if someone--say a thoughtful ancestor--had put $1.00
    (just ONE DOLLAR) in 1776 in an account for you earning 8 percent per year, you would have
    about $31,000,000 today! Too bad our ancestors didn't do that for us!</p>
<p align="left">You've all heard the story about Manhattan Island, New York, being
    purchased in 1626 by Peter Minuit from the Manhattan Indians for $24 worth of beads and
    trinkets. What a steal!? Perhaps not. If those Indians had invested that $24 at just 6% in
    some mutual fund, today that would be worth $70 billion. If they had been able to average
    8% a year, that $24 would today be worth $76 trillion!!</p>
<p align="left">What does that have to do with integrity? Alan Folkman suggested that just
    as substantial investment returns are accumulated over a long period of small, consistent
    investments, integrity is accumulated and compounded through the investment of small acts
    of honesty, consistency, and faithfulness. Small efforts at obedience, small measures of
    forgiveness, honesty in very small things, small attempts to follow the Savior, when
    practiced over many years, become ingrained in us forming eventually steel chords of a
    great soul of integrity. Then when the tests of life come--and they surely will come to
    all of us--that great soul of integrity will prove itself equal to the challenges.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, the converse is also true. Small acts of dishonesty, small
    lies, small thefts, small gossip, can also be compounded over time to the detriment of our
    souls.</p>
<p align="left">Perhaps this process of compounding is what the Lord had in mind when he
    spoke of the ten virgins. The five wise ones had saved up oil, drop by drop, perhaps over
    years. Starting early brings a much greater benefit than starting too late. The five
    foolish virgins who delayed found, like those who start saving late in life money or
    integrity, they could not possibly make up the difference. For them it was everlastingly
    too late.</p>
<p align="left">How do we know of we are becoming a person of integrity? Let me give some
    possible questions to ask ourselves to determine if we are on that road to integrity.
    These are the small things that we must do over and over to eventually become great souls
    of integrity.</p>
<p align="left">Am I honest in school assignments? Would I ever pass off work as mine when
    actually it was created by another? Would I ever take from another that which I should not
    without fair compensation--for example, do I use pirated computer software? Do I make
    illegal copies of copyrighted materials such as music or published articles?</p>
<p align="left">Is there integrity in my business dealings? If I received more than I
    should have, in a business transaction would I return the excess? Would I ever represent
    my product to a potential customer as something it is not?</p>
<p align="left">Does my dating comply with the principles of integrity? Do I help my date
    uphold principles to which we have committed our lives?</p>
<p align="left">Am I honest in my taxes? Am I honest in my tithing and fast offerings? Am
    I honest in my relationship with my employer? Can I be counted to provide an hour's work
    for an hour's pay? Can I be completely trusted with my employers assets? </p>
<p align="left">Can I be trusted with another's reputation--in other words, can I be
    trusted to avoid gossiping about another? Am I a true friend when that friend is not
    around?</p>
<p align="left">How do I behave when no one is watching, when no one can find out what I
    did? </p>
<p align="left">When I give my word, can it be relied upon implicitly? When I make a
    commitment, do I keep it? When I make a sacred covenant, do I uphold my vows?</p>
<p align="left">While it takes years to become a proven person of integrity, it is so easy
    to lose integrity--and so difficult to restore it. Nephi warned us that it is easy to
    &quot;&#133;lie a little, take advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy
    neighbor, there is no harm in this&#133;&quot; we might be tempted to say. (2 Nephi 28:8</p>
<p align="left">How do you know when you are losing your integrity? The still, small voice
    will tell you, the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. I promise you that if you listen and
    heed its warning, you will know clearly if you are getting on the wrong track and need to
    make a course correction. In contrast, if we ever become too busy or too insensitive to
    listen, then we may find ourselves as Laman and Lemuel. Nephi said of them:
    &quot;&#133;and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling
    that ye could not feel his words.&quot; (1 Nephi 17:45)</p>
<p align="left">I suggest to you that, while we have many examples of people of integrity
    all around us, we must look to the Savior to see the perfect example of a man of
    integrity. Throughout his life, he never wavered from doing his Father's will. He was the
    same inside and out--what he preached was exactly what he practiced. He never feared nor
    sought the opinions of the world but steadfastly carried out his divine mission. He stood
    ever ready to pay whatever price His integrity demanded--ultimately paying that enormous,
    incomprehensible price for us in Gethsemane and then on Calvary. He refused to
    &quot;shrink&quot; but drank from the bitter cup that was placed before him.</p>
<p align="left">I know he lives and leads this Church today through a living prophet,
    President Gordon B. Hinckley. What a great blessing we have to have this great prophet of
    integrity leading us today--both the Church and this wonderful institution, Ricks College.
    I testify that those who serve with President Hinckley--his counselors President Monson
    and President Faust, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Seventy--are also men of complete
    integrity, worthy of our trust and support. I have had the blessing of seeing these men
    close up and testify of their divine callings. I testify that Joseph Smith was a great man
    of integrity, the prophet of the restoration.</p>
<p align="left">I know that it is worth whatever price we must pay to become people of
    integrity. The world needs you to become such a person. The Lord needs to rely on us as
    people of integrity so that we may bless his children. Oh, how sweet it would be to have
    the Savior say of you and me:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;&#133;blessed [are you] for I, the Lord, love [you] because of the
    integrity of [your] heart&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants 124:15).</p>
<p align="left">In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">Nestled among the books of the prophets called of God to preach
      repentance to the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah is the
      marvelous Book of Daniel. In chapter five we find the dramatic handwriting
      on the wall episode. During one of his more riotous royal parties, King
      Belshazzar decides that he and his guests should drink intoxicating toasts
      to a few false gods using the sacred gold and silver cups which his father
      had taken into captivity from the temple in Jerusalem. (Daniel 5:1-5)</p>
<p>At the height of the merriment, the fingers of a man's hand suddenly
      appeared and wrote upon the wall of the banquet hall. When the regular
      soothsayers of the King were stumped, Daniel was called to interpret the
      handwriting on the wall. Daniel told Belshazzar, (see Daniel 5:22-23),
      "you have listed up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and ... have
      brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy
      wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised
      the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see
      not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is...thou
      hast not glorified:"</p>
<p>Then Daniel explained God's message that Belshazzar will lose his
      kingdom, because he had been "weighed in the balances and ... found
      wanting." (Daniel 5:27) Belshazzar's life and choices had been
      measured by God and were found inadequate; he had been caught short and as
      a consequence would lose everything he had thought was important.</p>
<p>For those of us who believe that mortality is the time when the Lord
      will "prove--or measure--(us) herewith to see if (we) will do all
      things whatsoever the Lord (our) God shall command (us)" (Abraham
      3:25), the last thing we want is to be measured by the Lord and found
      short of our potential, short of the eternal blessings that could have
      been ours if we had been valiant in our testimonies (see DC 76), short of
      hearing those sweet words, "well done, thou good and faithful
      servant." (Cf Matthew 25:21)</p>
<p>We live in a wonderful time when the gospel has been restored, when
      President Hinckley is truly leading the Church out of obscurity and into
      great light; a light that should illuminate our lives as well. We, as
      individuals and institutions, have marvelous opportunities for service and
      growth. And we also live in a dangerous time when Satan will do everything
      in his power to thwart the work of God and to bring about the misery of
      God's children.</p>
<p>I have learned that one of the most powerful strategies Satan uses to
      "cheat our souls and lead us carefully down to hell" (2 Nephi
      28:21) is to make us forget just who is in charge of the eternal balance
      scale. Satan would like us to become so confused by the world's rhetoric,
      rationality, and relativity that we forget who it is that will measure us
      for eternity and what measures he will use. The importance of accurate
      measurements is something we can all appreciate. In my profession as a
      nurse I am constantly relying on instruments to give me an accurate
      picture of a patient's condition. Scientists, economists, engineers, and
      educators all want to use the most accurate measurements in their
      disciplines. Yet for all the scientific and practical concerns we have
      about accurate measurements, we often seem to be so inaccurate in how we
      measure ourselves and others.</p>
<p>We are constantly measuring the focus of our energies, or the use of
      our time, or the substance of our self-esteem by some very dubious
      instruments. I know the ones I use to measure myself aren't always eternal
      or divine in perspective. Let me suggest just a few examples.</p>
<p>How many missionaries measure the success of their missions by how many
      people they baptized? It is true that we really do hope to baptize many
      people. The question is why? Because baptism is essential to entrance into
      the Lord's kingdom. It is the beginning of a covenant relationship with
      God and the gateway to the Plan of Salvation. Though, I haven't made a
      dedicated LDS gospel link search on this, I have yet to find anything that
      indicates we baptize in order to win contests with our friends in other
      missions, to win contests within our own missions, or that our salvation
      depends on how many other people used their agency to choose to be
      baptized.</p>
<p>I had the unique experience of serving three months of my mission in
      Connecticut during January, February, and March. We tracted for miles in
      freezing weather, made phone calls in the evening when it was too dark to
      be on the street, and rejoiced when we were able to teach a first
      discussion or present a family home evening. That didn't happen very often
      even though we were prayerful and worked hard. In April my mission
      assignment was changed to the Philippines. After being in the Philippines
      only a week I had taught more first discussions than I ever had in
      Connecticut in three months. One day one of the Assistants to the mission
      president asked me how I liked the Philippines. I waxed on about what a
      joy it was to be able to teach so many people and that it was certainly
      different than trying to find people in the United States. The Elder then
      said in a very confidential tone, "well, you know, they send the weak
      missionaries to the States and all the strong missionaries go
      foreign." Let me just say I took advantage of the opportunity to
      share my perspectives and experiences about the error of his judgement.
      Imagine measuring one's faith, devotion, courage, or intelligence by the
      geography of their mission call?</p>
<p>There are other inaccurate measures we often use. What about measuring
      our self-esteem and worthiness by whether we are married? What about
      measuring ourselves by the positions we obtain in or out of the church,
      but especially in the church? What about using the majors we choose as a
      measurement....after all, aren't some majors more worthy than others?</p>
<p>How about measuring ourselves by something more practical....our
      college GPA? Or by how much money we earn once we graduate from college,
      or by our looks, or the looks of the person we are dating, or the kind of
      car we drive, or heaven forbid, by whether our football or basketball
      teams win.</p>
<p>Money, power, influence, grades, majors, sports, baptism
      contests....ask yourself if any of these measurements are the ones the
      Lord uses to judge our fitness for his kingdom?</p>
<p>Some things may be a reasonable measuring device but not one the Lord
      uses. GPA is at least some measure of academic performance. But, if we let
      GPA be the sum total of how we measure our worth or another's worth,
      value, or progress in sacred things then we have made an grievous error.
      The best analogy I have is this: If I want to take a person's temperature,
      I don't use an engine oil dipstick. On the other hand, if I want to see if
      I am a quart low, I don't use a thermometer. If I want to bake a cake, I
      don't scurry to the desk and grab a ruler, a compass, and a t-square. If I
      am finishing my basement I don't measure the 2 X 4s with a blood pressure
      cuff or a teaspoon.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember, as we examine and choose what we want
      to build, to accomplish, to learn, and to do with our lives, is that when
      we select the measurements, or the standards, or the balances by which we
      want to be weighed, we are also selecting the master of the scales. We can
      not choose the measurements of one master and hope they will be sufficient
      for the other. Rulers don't measure temperature. Plumb lines will never
      tell us how fast someone runs the 100 meter dash.</p>
<p>Like Belshazzar, we can wile away our hours doing well in the wrong
      race. And, then the only eternal answer is, "you have been weighed in
      the balances and found wanting." Satan couldn't be happier with such
      a verdict.</p>
<p>Satan would love to have us believe that his measures are the only ones
      that really count. He would love to deceive us into believing that we are
      putting our energies in the right direction when we are not. Korihor, of
      Book of Mormon infamy (see Alma chapter 30), was someone who was very
      confused about measurements. He came under the influence of the Devil and
      taught his words because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind, even
      until he believed that they were true; and for this cause he withstood the
      truth (verse 53). Unfortunately, like many who choose incorrectly, Korihor
      learned too late "that the devil will not support his children at the
      last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell." (Verse 60)</p>
<p>The Lord has repeatedly counseled the members of His Church to choose
      well how they measure their lives. In section 121 (verses 34-46) of the
      Doctrine &amp; Covenants we learn that many are called but few are chosen
      because their hearts are set so much upon the things of the world and
      (they) aspire to the honors of men. And though women do not hold the
      priesthood as individuals but share in the blessings of the priesthood
      with their husbands and fathers it is important for women to understand
      that their eternal weights and measures are also discussed in the next
      verses. First the Lord explains false measures: he calls them the things
      of the world, the honors of men, covering our sins, gratifying pride,
      having vain ambitions, exercising dominion or compulsion upon the souls of
      the children of men, exercising unrighteous dominion, hypocrisy, and
      guile. Contrast those with his eternal measures that follow in the next
      verses: Maintaining influence by persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness,
      meekness, love unfeigned, kindness, reproving when needed but showing an
      increase of love, charity, faith, virtue.</p>
<p>Moroni saw our day very clearly and describes well our use of incorrect
      measurements (Mormon 8:35-39). "... behold, Jesus Christ hath shown
      you unto me, and I know your doing. And I know that ye do walk in the
      pride of your hearts, and there are none save a few only who do not lift
      themselves up in the pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine
      apparel, unto envying and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all
      manner of iniquities.....For behold, ye do love money, and your substance,
      and your fine apparel more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick
      and the afflicted....Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of
      Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless
      happiness than that misery which never dies---because of the praise of the
      world. Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life..."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many in society seem to be frantically running out to
      buy the measuring devices needed to construct the complete, deluxe, modern
      version of the natural man. And Satan is laughing all the way to the bank.
      Especially, when it is one of the Lord's covenant people who makes such a
      mistake. I know that many in our society couldn't comprehend this, but
      God, who is all powerful, all knowledgeable, all everything would like to
      help us become just like him and to inherit everything he has. There is no
      secret heavenly will that limits the number of his inheritors or the size
      of the inheritance. Anyone, who takes on the Lord's measurements, his
      weights and balances, can inherit a fullness of the Lord's glory.</p>
<p>Let me share some suggestions about keeping ourselves focused on the
      Lord's measures.</p>
<p>I spent almost a year in Nigeria doing the research for my doctoral
      dissertation. The northern Nigerian city of Kano is a unique blend of
      Africa and the Middle East. When I was about to leave Kano, a good friend
      Dauda Sule took me to the market to look for souvenirs. I found what I
      wanted: a blanket dyed in the ancient indigo vats of Kano. Dauda did the
      negotiations because I did not speak Hausa. Dauda and the owner of the
      blanket business went into a deep discussion that I didn't understand. The
      conversation went back and forth for several minutes. Then there was
      silence. At last the owner said something and the transaction was
      complete. Dauda then explained to me what had transpired. He had told the
      man that I was not a rich tourist, but a poor nursing student who had come
      to Nigeria to try to be helpful to people. He told the owner of the shop
      that I would pay whatever price he named because I trusted him. However,
      Dauda also said to him, "because she will pay whatever you say, if
      you cheat her, God will know it." The owner of the shop meditated
      long and hard on Dauda's words and finally said, "I love money but I
      honor God more. This is the fair price."</p>
<p>Imagine our integrity if every time a difficult choice or a mortal test
      came to us, we could say, "I honor God more." Regardless of the
      issue--whether it be a test of our virtue, a test of our honesty, a test
      of our charity, a test of our humility-- imagine the strength we could
      have in simply saying, "I honor God more." The world tells us to
      do what everyone else is doing because morality and values are relative.
      Can we say, I honor God more? The world tells us that if being unethical
      is not illegal, we should always try to gain an advantage over others. Can
      we say, I honor God more? The world tells us to do what ever we want to do
      regardless of our previous commitments and covenants. Can we say, I honor
      God more? The world tells us that popularity is better than integrity. Can
      we say, I honor God more?</p>
<p>Knowing that God is my father and that the atonement crafted by God's
      son, Jesus Christ, is true and real gives me perspective, purpose,
      direction, pattern, hope and helps me know which measurements of my
      performance have enduring worth.</p>
<p>Satan may momentarily convince us to use the wrong measuring tools for
      our lives. But, what would be even worse for us would be if he were able
      to deceive us about the finality of those measurements and our inability
      to change to new ones. I believe that Satan's greatest lie, of all the
      lies he's fathered, is to convince us that once we have been dumb enough,
      or misled enough, or stiff-necked enough to try to measure temperatures
      with a yard stick that we are stuck there forever, never to be able to
      trade that yard stick for the thermometer we really needed all along. The
      atonement makes it possible to trade measuring sticks as it were; to turn
      away from false Gods and return to the one true and living God.
      Repentance, the laying down of the wrong and the picking up of the right,
      is possible because of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Ezekiel (33:14-16)
      describes it this way, "If he turn from his sin, and do that which is
      lawful and right; if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had
      robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he
      shall surely live, he shall not die. None of his sins that he hath
      committed shall be mentioned unto him, he hath done that which is lawful
      and right; he shall surely live." With such a gift, the gift of life
      and the forgetting of our sins, no wonder we would trust and honor God
      more than the measures of the world.</p>
<p>One of the most important blessings the Lord has given us to keep us on
      his scales is the gift of the Holy Ghost. If we, in our somewhat ignorant
      mortal state, are shopping in the great measurement mall of mortality,
      what better blessing than to have the Holy Ghost who teaches all things
      that we should do and bears record of the truth, whisper directions when
      we are making critical decisions. The Lord really doesn't want our blind
      obedience. He wants sighted, visionary, and chosen obedience. We can test
      every doctrine and instruction read in the scriptures, or heard from the
      pulpit in general conference, or spoken by any of those we sustain as
      prophets and revelators. We can test them through prayer, through a trial
      run at obedience (see Alma 32) and the Holy Ghost can confirm what is
      true. We can receive answers to our deepest prayers Section 121 teaches us
      (verses 45-46) that the more we try to put our measurements of self in
      harmony with the Lord, the more we will be taught what else we should do.
      If we have charity, faith, and virtue then the Holy Ghost shall be our
      constant companion. And when we have been answered and directed by the
      Holy Ghost, we can feel sustained in knowing and in doing what is right.</p>
<p>Let me share two examples. I was raised in a home where my father
      treated his sons and his daughter equally. I never felt that I was less
      important to him, or less capable than my brothers. Despite this positive
      childhood and adolescence, I had a period of worrying about the position
      of women in the church. Some of society's measuring devices made me wonder
      about my value and place in the Church. I eventually decided to take this
      concern to the Lord. I pleaded to know what my value was to the church, to
      the Lord, being a woman first of all, and worse yet, a single one at that.
      I just needed to know how the Lord was measuring things. The answer I
      received was very simple and yet very powerful. It was, "Sandra, I
      love my daughters as much as I love my sons. My daughters are as important
      to the kingdom as are my sons. I value my daughters as much as I value my
      sons." Those simple words were a mighty revelation to me. I was never
      worried again. I am at peace with the management of the kingdom because I
      know how the Lord measures my value. I have no need to be confused by the
      world's measures. I had personal revelation and that was all that
      mattered.</p>
<p>The second example. I had only been in the Philippines for two weeks
      when I was assigned to a new companion and a new area. On my first day in
      the new area we were accompanied by our zone leaders. We went to visit a
      man who had received the first two discussions several weeks before. I had
      never met him. When we arrived at the humble home, Brother Flores seemed
      disheveled. His long hair was uncombed and his eyes were bloodshot. I
      really believed he had a hangover or was on drugs. Nevertheless, we
      proceeded with our visit. We were giving the third lesson, which at the
      time was a review of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. In those days,
      the memorized dialogue was on one page and on the facing page were
      instructions to the missionaries. In this particular lesson there was a
      place where the missionary instructions stated, "at this point, if
      moved by the spirit, challenge Brother Brown to be baptized." We
      missionaries took turns in reciting the discussion. As I went ahead in my
      mind to the rest of the discussion, I could tell that my next paragraph
      would coincide with the "if moved by the spirit" instructions.
      The minute that thought came into my mind I was overwhelmed by the feeling
      that I should challenge Brother Flores to be baptized. I fought this
      feeling. I had just met him and didn't know him very well. Besides, I
      thought he was hungover and I should just keep my mouth shut about a
      baptism. I felt a swelling fullness in my chest and even though I argued
      with this feeling, it only became stronger. When my turn came, I could
      only follow that feeling.</p>
<p>At that time, the baptismal challenge was a two page dialogue. It was
      the first thing all missionaries memorized. The minute I said, "while
      translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith and his scribe, Oliver
      Cowdery, were very impressed with its teachings about baptism" the
      other missionaries knew exactly what I was doing. The zone leader sitting
      next to me gave me a message with his foot and his eyes that said,
      "You're crazy." My poor companion was stunned. I, being
      overwhelmed by this powerful feeling, yet fully aware of the judgment of
      my fellow missionaries, could do nothing but continue with the challenge.
      Brother Flores said he wanted to be baptized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The next two weeks were a flurry of activity. We had to teach four
      remaining lessons and Brother Flores had to be interviewed. The interview
      process went better for him than it did for me. The zone leaders who did
      the interview told me that they didn't think he should be baptized and
      that they were only going through with it because I was recommending him.
      One of them told me that Brother Flores' sins committed after baptism
      would be on my head because I was the one making a terrible mistake. By
      the way, I haven't found that doctrine in any gospel link search either.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, I don't think I experienced a fullness of joy at
      Brother Flores' baptism. I was too worried about compounding my sins with
      his sins. Yet, I also knew what I had felt and I couldn't deny the source
      because the feeling was too positive, too good to be anything but the Holy
      Ghost. Brother Flores's joy was full. He had fasted nearly two days before
      his baptism to, as he said, "show the Lord how much I love him and am
      grateful to be baptized."</p>
<p>After Brother Flores was baptized we taught his sister and brother. We
      taught his parents and he was able to baptize them. I still keep in touch
      with the Flores family. They are active and happy in the Church and love
      the Lord. The light of the gospel changed their lives. I am grateful that
      I had that sweet experience with them. How I love that family.</p>
<p>When the Holy Ghost inspires and teaches us we can rely on his wisdom.
      At the beginning I was measuring Brother Flores by my natural eyes and my
      mortality clouded my judgement of him. The Holy Ghost had to quickly teach
      me how the Lord was measuring Brother Flores and what the Lord wanted to
      have happen in that discussion. I know he will do the same with you in
      your lives and callings.</p>
<p>Another of Satan's tricks and temptations is to make us believe that
      truth is relative, or if not relative then completely unimportant. He
      wants us to believe that the Lord's measuring sticks--like honesty,
      virtue, integrity, compassion, kindness, forgiveness, and
      accountability--are passe'. He shows us many people who are not living the
      commandments and who still have power, financial security, the praise of
      others, and get off without punishment. He would like us to believe that
      religious devotion is foolish and has no return on our investment.
      Sometimes when we are trying hard to be obedient yet experience great
      difficulties we are vulnerable and can be fooled that our obedience isn't
      worth it. But which measuring scale is driving our judgement? Do we see
      what is eternally important?</p>
<p>Let me share with you an experience that taught me this lesson very
      well. My mission call was originally to Brazil. When I arrived at the old
      LTM in Provo, I was the only sister who would be learning Portuguese. The
      biggest problem was studying the language. The rules forbade elders
      studying with sisters and I didn't see how I was ever going to learn to
      speak Portuguese if I couldn't practice with someone. Finally, as a
      compromise, I was allowed to study with an elder if we sat in the
      cafeteria. Generally though, I spent much of my study time alone. One day
      I was studying the discussion about the Savior's role as Creator and
      Redeemer. I was alone with my thoughts and with the truths of the lesson.
      In that tiny classroom I had one of the most significant testimony
      building experiences of my life. The sweetness of redemption and the love
      of the Savior filled my heart and I felt his encouragement.</p>
<p>Because we were unable to get visas to travel to Brazil, my district
      was sent to the New York City Mission. When we arrived the mission
      president told me that I was creating severe problems for him because he
      now had an uneven number of sisters and no apartments in the mission would
      accommodate three sisters. After a few days of pondering, however, he sent
      me to Manchester, Connecticut.</p>
<p>It wasn't long after arriving in Manchester that I met Jane, a young
      woman who was investigating the Church. Unfortunately I had replaced her
      favorite sister. She even wrote to the mission president about having me
      exchanged for her favorite sister but the mission president denied her
      request. One night Jane had come to our apartment for a lesson. It just
      happened to be that lesson on Jesus Christ, the Creator and Redeemer. From
      the minute we started the lesson something was wrong. Jane was acting
      flippant, almost rude. She wouldn't answer questions except with silly or
      inane answers. I tried to be patient, but finally, I could stand the
      mockery no longer. I slammed the flip chart shut and said, "this is
      too important to me to continue with you acting this way. Either cut the
      smart stuff and listen or get out."</p>
<p>Jane accepted my gentle invitation and got out. We didn't see her for
      days. My companions were sure that I had offended our golden contact and
      driven her from the Church. I was almost sure I had. It was gloomy. I
      wondered why the Lord had called me to Brazil, sent me through an
      intensive language course, just so that I could go to Connecticut and
      offend people in English.</p>
<p>After what seemed forever, but I think was really only about two weeks,
      Jane called and invited us to her home for a slide show. We arrived
      somewhat wary but Jane launched into a history of her family vacations.
      Jane's travelogue covered most of the eastern seaboard and then headed
      west. Suddenly, a slide of Temple Square in Salt Lake City flashed onto
      the wall. Jane said, "This is Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah,
      the headquarters of the Church I want to join."</p>
<p>We were amazed and thrilled. Jane was baptized and two months later I
      was reassigned to the Phillippines, the Church having given up on getting
      me a visa to Brazil. Jane served a mission in Arizona a few months later.
      After her mission she called me. She said that on that night I had told
      her to listen or get out she had made up her mind to try an experiment
      before she came to the discussion. She had read the Book of Mormon
      completely and knew it was true. She knew what we were teaching her was
      true. But, she said, "I didn't know if it was important." She
      decided to test us by being obnoxious. She told herself that she would
      know whether the truth was important by how we responded to her rude
      behavior. She then told me that she knew that the sister I replaced would
      probably have been so afraid of hurting her feelings that she would have
      let her be rude all night. She then said, "you made me know how
      important the gospel was and the reason I had to get out of the room was
      that I knew I had to make a life-changing decision."</p>
<p>Did I waste my time in the LTM learning a language I never used? Were
      my three months in the New York City mission a waste? Maybe if I were to
      use the world's measures the answers would be yes. How inefficient to
      study a language I would never use. How ridiculous to send me to
      Connecticut in a frozen winter dressed in my tropical Brazilian wardrobe
      when the Church could have just sent me straight from the LTM to the
      Philippines instead. But, if measured by what the Lord considered to be
      important for my learning and growth and for Jane's learning and growth,
      every experience I had better prepared me to be the Lord's instrument.
      Would he do all that for one soul? Or two souls? Yes, I believe he did.</p>
<p>I began today by referring to the Book of Daniel. The story of
      Belshazzar, the King who was weighed in the balances and found wanting, is
      contrasted in the same book with young men who knew exactly who the master
      is and what his measurements are. Daniel understood God's dietary laws and
      the significance of eating the King's food which might have been part of
      ritual worship of the gods of Babylon. He and his friends honored God and
      would not eat. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego also understood that the
      consequences of their choices would lead them to a fiery furnace. Still
      they chose the eternal measurement and honored God and stepped into the
      flames. Daniel knew what was really important when he chose to continue to
      pray to God despite a royal edict. How important could the measurements of
      the King of Babylon be in comparison to the measurements of the Most High
      God?</p>
<p>I pray that we might choose the correct and eternal 
      measurements of our worth and our direction; that the importance of the 
      Lord's perspective will distill on our minds and hearts, and that we will 
      be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost to help us evaluate 
      ourselves with eternal instruments. I testify that the atonement makes it 
      possible for us to change, to become new, to have new measurements in our 
      lives. I testify that the Kingdom of God will fill the earth and that the 
      Lord needs us to be instruments of light and truth in proclaiming all that 
      is right, and good, and honorable about the gospel by living it well. May 
      the Lord bless us and help us to love, honor, and serve him, in the name 
      of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">It is both a privilege and an honor to speak to you on this occasion. Every time my
    wife and I visit this campus, we marvel at the enormous force for good you represent. You
    are indeed the future leaders who will shape this world. You will do that by building your
    own families and applying all you learn while you are here. </p>
<p>Representing your parents, we hope you know how much we love you and how happy we are
    because of the good choices you are making. Our feelings are similar to the apostle John
    when he said, &quot;I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in

    for President and Sister Bednar. He is highly qualified academically to lead you, but even
    more importantly, has been called by the Lord to be here at Ricks College right now for
    you. Listen to him and apply his teachings in your life. Watch how he treats his wife and
    let their example be a model for you in all you will become. This will be as important as
    anything you are taught here at Ricks College.</p>
<p>I thank you individually for the quiet prayers you have offered in your hearts in

<p>His companionship through the Holy Spirit will be the source of our instruction today.</p>
<p>Last week, my wife and I rented a car and drove from Boston to New Hampshire. We were
    to meet President and Sister Hunter of the New Hampshire, Manchester Mission. The
    President had given us instructions to get to the mission home. We also had a map of the
    area. Our rental car was equipped with a sophisticated instrument called the
    &quot;Magellan, never lost&quot; system. It is the most advanced on-board system ever
    engineered by experts in satellite navigation technology. It gives clear turn-by-turn
    voice prompts as well as visual directions. With the car in a parked position, we entered
    the city and street address of the mission home and started our journey. The instructions
    were precise and accurate.... &quot;in one mile you will make a right hand turn&quot; then
    in a moment, &quot;get into the right lane and exit in two-tenths of a mile.&quot;</p>
<p>We were instructed to exit the turnpike at the first toll booth. We became confused
    because there were different toll booths for different destinations, and we weren&#146;t
    sure which was the correct one. We chose the one that we thought was the correct exit, but
    we made a mistake. We actually got off the turnpike one exit too soon. It required us to
    stop the vehicle and then to reprogram the system based upon our new location. With the
    help of our navigation system, we knew precisely where we were. We then got back onto the
    Everett Turnpike so we could take the correct exit. We learned to depend upon our on-board
    navigational instrument. Without it, we would have been lost and confused. We also would
    not have made a timely connection with the mission president. As it turned out, we arrived
    on time and were grateful for the help we received.</p>
<p>We each have our own on-board navigation system to give us turn-by-turn instructions.
    However, it has nothing to do with finding a certain street or a specific location. It has
    everything to do with our eternal destination. Our destination is clearly defined, and a
    good navigation system will help us achieve exaltation and eternal life.</p>
<p>We all want to be on the right road. We all desire to move effectively down that
    highway of life with the least amount of detours, delays and rough road. We frequently
    find ourselves caught in the gridlock of life with the pressures of everything around us
    causing us to just flow at the same speed as everyone else. Just like my wife and I
    experienced, we all have moments when we get slightly confused and need additional help in
    making correct choices. We are frequently at a crossroads where we must choose one of two
    highways, the lower road leading to spiritual delays and sorrow or the higher road leading
    to spiritual progress and happiness. It is very important for us to always choose the
    higher road.</p>
<p>It is an eternal truth that through the choices we make, we shape our own destiny. Our
    success or failure, peace or discontent, happiness or misery, depend upon the choices we
    make each day. As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have a
    built-in navigation system. We have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost to direct us in
    all things. &quot;Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy
    Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart&quot; (D&amp;C 8:2).</p>
<p>This navigation system is quiet, peaceful, and subtle compared to a world that demands
    instant gratification and is too often captivated by that which is loud, flashy, and
    crude. Listen to the words of the hymn &quot;Let the Holy Spirit Guide&quot; which
    beautifully describe the function of the Holy Spirit:</p>
<p>Let the Holy Spirit <i>guide</i>;<br />Let him <i>teach</i> us what is true<br />He will 				<i>testify</i> of Christ,<br /><i>Light our minds</i> with Heaven&#146;s view.</p>
<p>Let the Holy Spirit guard;<br />Let his whisper <i>govern choice</i>.<br />He will 				<i>lead us</i> safely home,&nbsp;<br />If we listen to his voice.</p>
<p>Let the Spirit <i>heal our hearts</i>,<br />Thru his quiet, gentle power.<br /> <i>May we purify our lives,<br />To receive him hour by hour</i>.</p>
<p>For our navigation system to work effectively, we must have an understanding of where
    we are and where we are going. This gives us the point of reference and the tracking
    system to move us along identified routes to our destination. For example, it would be
    very difficult for the navigation system to work if we were in the Brazilian rain forest
    and there were no identifiable points of reference. This would present a challenge even
    for the sophisticated global positioning system.</p>
<p>You have the benefit of knowing precisely where you are. You are here at Ricks College,
    you have already mapped your environment and understand where you are. You each got here
    by making some very good choices. You might be in a new environment which requires you to
    do some exploring to establish your precise location, but you came from a background which
    was familiar to you and allowed you to move from that point of reference to where you are
    today.</p>
<p>In order for an on-board navigation system to work, you must stop, allowing the system
    to identify exactly where you are by its global positioning system. Then you can program
    in your desired destination. It will then suggest the best routing for you.</p>
<p>That is exactly what you must do here at college. You must stop and take time to
    evaluate precisely where you are. It is not an imaginary place. You are right here. Look
    around. This is your true point of beginning. This is your precise location. The part that
    is slightly more complicated, goes beyond your physical location. It has to do with where
    you are on your <u>spiritual</u> highway. That is the part which requires some honest
    introspection and personal prayer to determine your exact position. The Lord knows your
    precise spiritual location. He has said, &quot;I know thy heart, and have heard thy
    prayers...&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants 112:11).</p>
<p>I assure you that He knows you and loves you. He is aware of your precise physical and
    spiritual location. He knows if you are well positioned and he knows if you are in need of
    some course correction. He knows your heart and He knows your desires to seek and remain
    on the higher road. </p>
<p>Often you can be on the right road, but will be assaulted from all sides with offers to
    take other roads or more attractive travel itineraries. The adversary will be doing his
    best to lead you off your desired course. He is relentless in catching your attention, and
    then, ever so craftily, he will lead you into dangerous blind canyons and dead ends.</p>
<p>The other day, my wife and I were in the grocery store to do a little shopping. While
    we were waiting in line at the check-out counter I glanced at the magazines. I saw
    portrayed on the covers of many magazines, the idols of the movie screen, the heroes of
    the athletic field; those faces and bodies that many young people try to emulate as
    defying the laws of God and rationalizing away sinful practices, seemingly with no ill
    effect. Don&#146;t you believe it for a minute. They are destroying their futures.</p>
<p>Satan doesn&#146;t want you to reach your ultimate destination, he doesn&#146;t want
    you to fulfill your divine roles, so he tries to lead you astray. He makes things that are
    wrong appear right and even exciting. He wants to destroy your bodies and he encourages
    you to break the commandments. He makes the road look smooth and enticing.</p>
<p>With permission, I share with you an excerpt from a letter I received from a father who
    is concerned with the welfare of his daughter. </p>
<p>I have four beautiful daughters aged from 19-26. All of them have suffered to some
        extent from eating disorders. They all relate this destructive tendency to pressures from
        the outside world to conform to its image of women. This has been reinforced with
        unfortunate comments by young men. Three of my daughters seem to have controlled the
        problem but my youngest daughter is in trouble. She is now consuming 300-500 calories per
        day and shows no sign of overcoming her self-destructive habits. We are at the threshold
        of placing her in an institution for help. We have no where else to turn.</p>
<p>&quot;Fifteen percent of young women with full blown anorexia die from this disorder. I
        am currently grasping for understanding of this disorder which I think is one
        manifestation of women&#146;s low self-esteem imposed by our society. It is Satan at work.
        At the moment her body image, imposed by the world, has control. Does she understand that
        the most important image she should have of herself is that of a holy temple endowed with
        the power and love of God? Does she understand that she should do nothing to desecrate her
        temple? I have not taught her this truth with enough consistency and clarity. Would it
        make a difference if I had?&quot;</p>
<p>I pondered the anguish and heartbreak of this father. He loves his precious daughter.
    This is happening to many of our young women. You must not let Satan reduce your
    self-esteem. Don&#146;t let the world pull you off course. Our Heavenly Father loves each
    of you and wants you to return home, but He will not remove your agency. You must do your
    part and be steady in making correct choices.</p>
<p>Satan&#146;s desire is for you to not know where you are and to not check in to confirm
    your location. He is the father of lies and will do all possible to lure you into his
    cunning snare. His desire is to throw enough immediate pleasure your way that you never
    even worry about where you are. He even causes you to have moments of discouragement or
    lack of faith. There may be moments when you are driven off-course or have unexpected
    detours.</p>
<p>I would like to share a true story with you which involved a close friend of mine. 		</p>
<p>Cody Parmer and his friend were coming home from fishing almost two years ago. They
    lost control of their pick-up truck, resulting in an end-over-end roll over. Both boys
    were ejected from the truck. Cody&#146;s friend was taken by ambulance to a nearby
    hospital where he was in very critical condition. Cody&#146;s injuries were much more
    severe so he was life-flighted to a hospital in Idaho Falls. He was not given any hope of
    survival and was then air lifted to the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>It was determined that he had a broken neck, a broken arm, a pelvis broken in four
    places, sixteen fractures in his face, and a severely fractured skull. Due to the pressure
    in his head, he lost vision in his left eye. His parents were told that he was not
    expected to live and they became very discouraged. Even with such negative prognosis for
    Cody&#146;s future, his parents did not lose hope. They asked the doctors to continue to
    do all they could for their son, which included a steel plate and 2 screws in his neck, a
    plate with 7 screws in his arm, and a pelvic brace drilled and attached to his right hip.
    While at home recovering, he started leaking spinal fluid out his nose, resulting in
    another surgery. His family was encouraged that he was making some progress, then Cody
    started to have major head aches, resulting in a return to the LDS Hospital. Tests
    discovered a leaking artery in the brain. After an unsuccessful surgery, he was
    rescheduled for another operation ten days later. Following that surgery, he had a massive
    brain hemorrhage, causing him to be totally comatose again. During the 8-hour brain
    surgery, Cody&#146;s parents were told that he would be paralyzed on the left side 		<u>if</u>
    he was even able to survive the surgery. He struggled following the surgery, and was once
    again life-flighted back to the LDS hospital for the third time. Additional lengthy brain
    surgery was successful in repairing his original leaking artery. His parents were then
    told that Cody&#146;s brain scan was not good and that there was very little chance of him
    surviving. They were told that if by some slight chance he did live, he would assuredly be
    a vegetable.</p>
<p>It was right at this stage that I first met Cody and his family. I was introduced to
    them by a Stake President in Idaho Falls, following an assignment in their stake. Sister
    Zwick and I were pleased to visit Cody in the LDS Hospital and to there give him a
    Priesthood blessing. We sensed the family&#146;s frustrations and discouragement, however,
    we were overwhelmed by their steadiness, faith and courage.</p>
<p>Cody was in a deep coma when we first met him. While still in his coma, doctors
    replaced his bone plate. Soon after this his body rejected the plate and it had to be
    removed. After 45 days in the hospital, his parents took him home rather than following
    the doctor&#146;s advice to institutionalize him. This required 24-hour care. His parents
    were taught how to change his tracheotomy tube and how to provide nourishment through a
    feeding tube that went directly into his stomach. They frequently sucked fluid from his
    lungs to avoid pneumonia. Cody could not yet speak or even respond to the loving care of
    his parents and other family members.</p>
<p>His parents were steady and faithful throughout this entire trial. They truly are among
    the most valiant people we have ever known. With great faith in the Lord, strengthened by
    their love for Cody, they dressed him daily, placed him in his wheelchair, read scriptures
    together, and prayed with Cody. They learned that one finger meant yes and
    two fingers meant
    no. Finally, on the fourth surgery, his body accepted a titanium plate connected with 27
    screws. Still struggling with pressure and leakage, a shunt was surgically implanted.</p>
<p>Six months later, following sixteen major surgeries, Cody is progressing steadily. His
    five weeks at the LDS Hospital re-habilitation unit, his continual therapy, and even more
    importantly, his abiding faith and positive outlook, have helped him to talk, to smile, to
    stand holding 70% of his body, to swallow ten spoonfuls of water, to hold a pencil, to
    balance so he could sit for 17 seconds, to sit in his wheelchair, to walk with a brace and
    now with a cane.</p>
<p>I remember very well the day he set a record with 16 steps on his own. Truly Cody
    Parmer is a walking miracle. In fact he will graduate from Skyline High School this spring
    with a letter in walking.</p>
<p>He was also recently voted the Homecoming King by his peers at his High School. Sister
    Zwick and I are proud to know Cody and his family. We consider them eternal friends, and
    thank them for the many lessons on faith and courage they have taught to our family since
    the time we first met them. We are grateful to have been in their home where we have seen
    the support of so many close friends and family at Cody&#146;s side. We are particularly
    warmed by their deep sense of gratitude for each little incremental step of improvement
    which Cody has made along this very long and difficult road of improvement.</p>
<p>Cody as well as his family went through struggle, pain, and setbacks. They experienced
    their own personal Gethsemane. But they never lost faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Cody
    had every reason to let discouragement drag him down but he knows what his ultimate
    destination is. Instead of being consumed by his trials and tests, he was refined by them.
    Instead of losing his way, he found his way. My friend Cody is here today with his
    wonderful parents. We wanted you to get personally acquainted with one of life&#146;s true
    heros.</p>
<p>Cody....come join me for a few moments.</p>
<p>You are observing one of life's great miracles.</p>
<p>Cody, how do you continue to overcome discouragement and cope with the challenges you
    face everyday?</p>
<p><em>Friends are also extremely important. You got to pick good friends. Choose friends
        that are gonna stay on the right path. They are gonna go out on Friday night and do the
        right thing. They are not going out drinking and stuff. You can go out and have a good,
        fun time, but you can also do good things. Friends are have been important. I have some
        great friends.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Tell us how you feel about the power of the Priesthood and of God&#146;s love for you.</p>
<p>We have learned valuable principles from Cody.</p>
<p>Don&#146;t allow yourselves to be discouraged by events which you cannot control.
    Overcome discouragement by trusting in the Lord and losing yourselves serving others. When
    your service is pure, you will be able to make adjustments in your own behavior which will
    result in happiness and in you knowing of your own self worth. This will also qualify you
    to receive more responsibility and to have added light and understanding. Cody learned the
    importance of prayer and exercising his faith in the Savior.</p>
<p>Thank you, Cody for joining us today.</p>
<p>There are times when it is hard, very hard. You may be worrying about finances, health,
    grades or who you should marry. Relationships are sometimes difficult and family problems
    are real and sometimes it seems that no one understands. Immorality, dishonesty,
    immodesty, pornography, discouragement and all kinds of evil influences are flaunted on
    every side. Self-discipline is a lifetime process. It requires you to trust and act upon
    the promptings of the Spirit. If you will pray and study the scriptures, you will know
    what direction to take and you will be blessed in making correct choices.</p>
<p>Just because we have challenges and trials, or difficult decisions to make. Just
    because sometimes it seems like it is two steps forward and one step back, we must never
    allow Satan to pull us off course. When we begin to make incorrect choices we move further
    and further away from our true source of happiness. The Lord has made it clear to us that
    sin never was happiness. Too many try to serve two masters -- the Lord and their own
    selfish interests.</p>
<p>I have thought recently of one of the finest missionary companions I was ever
    privileged to work with. He had singular gifts and was an inspirational leader in our
    mission. He had such unusual skills that everyone wanted to learn from him.</p>
<p>He returned from his mission and made some excellent choices which resulted in him
    marrying a wonderful girl for time and all eternity in the Los Angeles Temple. They were
    blessed with four outstanding children.</p>
<p>Part of his law enforcement and legal work included some close contact with drug
    enforcement and other promiscuous behavior. He was caught in Satan&#146;s subtle snare.
    One bad decision lead to another and then another. Within a short period of time he was
    caught in a spiritual free fall. He lost his fine wife and children in the process. Today
    he lives without the benefit of the Priesthood or his temple blessings. His life has been
    one of sadness, of anger and frustration. These seemingly small decisions which resulted
    in the spirit being doused have now caused him to be bitter toward the very things which
    were at one time his powerful strengths.</p>
<p>My heart is troubled because of his present condition without the blessings of the
    Gospel in his life.</p>
<p>History repeats itself as spiritual laws are violated.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of the Lord! O ye fair
    ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open arms to receive you!
    Behold, if ye had not done this, ye would not have fallen. But behold, ye are fallen, and
    I mourn your loss. Behold, ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot bring your return.&quot;</p>
<p>C. S. Lewis wisely observed, &quot;It does not matter how small the sins are, provided
    that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out in to the
    nothing. Indeed, the safest road to Hell is the gradual one. The gentle slope, soft
    underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.&quot;</p>
<p>I believe that my friend is saddened with all he has lost by taking this unmarked trail
    of destruction. I marvel that one of the very elect of God with a spiritual destiny of
    excellence has now fallen prey to the wicked influence of the adversary. It makes me sad
    to think that his wife to whom he was once sealed, and those beautiful children born under
    sacred covenant will not be his eternally. Oh, how I mourn his loss.</p>
<p>My trusted friends, be so very cautious to not allow even a slight deviation from your
    course of happiness. If you think you can procrastinate repentance or if you are of the
    opinion that personal prayer and daily scripture study are not important, just remember
    what happened to my finest missionary companion. I assure you that there is no happiness
    in what he is now going without.</p>
<p>The navigation system has a detailed set of instructions with specific directions which
    must be followed in order for it to function properly. These instructions in our personal
    lives are the Holy scriptures. They are the &quot;voice of the Lord, and the power of God
    unto salvation&quot; (D&amp;C 68:4). There are so many blessings promised to those who
    know the scriptures. One of these blessings is that the scriptures, like the iron rod, can
    help us pass safely through the mist of darkness which surrounds us in this world.</p>
<p>If we catch hold of the scriptures and cling to them, if we increase our study and
    application, and if we pray for understanding and live so the spirit can teach us, the
    scriptures will save us from temptations. The scriptures can help you make good decisions.
    The scriptures can keep you safe and lead you unto salvation. When we read the scriptures
    we invite and make ourselves accessible to the communications of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Learn to ponder the things of the Spirit and to respond to its promptings; filter out
    the static generated by Satan. As you become attuned to the Spirit, &quot;thine eyes shall
    hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it&quot; (Isaiah 3:21).</p>
<p>We must each decide which of all the outside voices we will listen to and believe.
    Throughout our lives we must be steady in choosing that which comes from the Lord and to
    avoid that which comes from Satan. Our daily choices shape our character.</p>
<p>The Spirit&#146;s voice is calm and peaceful. &quot;And the work of righteousness shall
    be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever&quot;
    (Isaiah 32:17).</p>
<p>To have joy in this life we are told to &quot;give ear to the voice of the living God;
    and attend to the words of wisdom which shall be given unto you&quot;
    (Doctrine and Covenants 50:1). </p>
<p>As we earnestly seek the spirit in our lives by daily scripture study and by quiet
    moments where we connect with our divine source, we position ourselves to receive clear
    spiritual direction in our lives.</p>
<p>I remember clearly the very place I was at the University of Utah when I made a
    decision not to pursue Architecture as a professional career and to focus my attention on
    a different course of study. It came in subtle suggestions at first which motivated me to
    pray with the intent to know. After prayerful consideration, it was perfectly clear to me
    that I was not to be an architect.</p>
<p>Since that time, over thirty years ago, I have worked with many architects, and
    although I have great respect and admiration for their noble profession, it became ever
    clear to me that the satisfaction I received from actually building the structure was more
    satisfying for me than designing it. My own career as a builder was a direct result of
    listening to the spirit and following its whisperings.</p>
<p>Hearkening to the voice of living Prophets is another navigational tool which gives us
    &quot;Peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come&quot;
    (Doctrine and Covenants 59:23). </p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee reminded us, &quot;the most important thing you can do is to
    learn to talk to God. Talk to Him as you would talk to your father, for He is your father,
    and He wants you to talk to Him. He wants you to cultivate ears to listen, when He gives
    you the impressions of the spirit to tell you what to do. If you learn to give heed to the
    sudden ideas which come to your mind, you will find those things coming through in the
    very hour of your need. If you will cultivate an ear to hear these promptings you will
    have learned to walk by the spirit of revelation.&quot;</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley has warned us: &quot;You must find a place to commune with
    the Lord and feel of His Spirit. This must happen in our lives not occasionally but
    constantly. The need is so great. We can be so much more effective. In the rush of our
    lives, we do not take enough time to ponder and meditate and go to the Lord. We need the
    Lord&#146;s help if we are to do His work.&quot;</p>
<p>President Hinckley has also taught, &quot;The adversary will tempt us and do all he can
    to destroy and deceive us. It is strenuous and difficult to get the Spirit of the Lord. We
    are not expected to fast 40 days and nights, but we are expected to fast at appropriate
    times and plead with the Lord for His Spirit. We are prone to making decisions too rashly,
    out of our own wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>Our lives become extremely busy. We can all relate to this. We run from one class to
    another. We wear ourselves out in thoughtless pursuit of goals which are highly ephemeral.
    We are entitled to spend some quiet time alone, in introspection, in spiritual
    development. Blessings from Priesthood leaders, fathers and husbands are additional tools
    which allow us to stay on the higher road. Frequently review your Patriarchal blessing for
    guidance. It will give you additional light and understanding. Be honest with your
    Priesthood leaders. It is your opportunity for introspection and progress review. It is a
    safety precaution which will prevent a costly detour along the critical path of reaching
    exaltation and eternal life.</p>
<p>The Lord himself has said, &quot;I will go before your face. I will be on your right
    hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about
    you to bear you up.&quot;</p>
<p>It is not possible for me to describe to you what a powerful force for good you are in
    the entire world. Genuine thanks to you for all you have taught me while we have been
    together. Seated together like we are here today, we gain strength and added light from
    each other. You are powerful and will make a positive difference in the lives of thousands
    you touch while you are here on this beautiful campus and well after you leave here. You
    must always know precisely where you are, even when all that surrounds you is a background
    of darkness and confusion. Your responsibility is to continue to generate a bright light
    and to even co-generate light and knowledge as you link up with the Holy Ghost as your
    source of inspiration. You are on a well-marked path that leads to our eternal home.</p>
<p>Please know that we trust you, we believe in you, we love you and oh how we pray for
    your happiness. I testify that the higher road, consistent with God&#146;s great plan for
    happiness, will lead us to eternal happiness. In fact, I believe that if we aren&#146;t
    diligent in pursuing this high road, and actually stay on it, it won&#146;t matter too
    much which other road we are on.</p>
<p>Please know of our abiding love and of our devotion to each of you, our trusted
    friends.</p>
<p>I testify that Gordon B. Hinckley is our living Prophet and that he seeks and receives
    divine guidance from God.</p>
<p>I testify that the Book of Mormon is a perfect witness of Jesus Christ. It is a
    powerful testament of truth, sealed with the blood of its translator. May you individually
    study its contents and gain your own witness that it is true.</p>
<p>I testify that God, our Heavenly Father lives. With that same certainty, I testify that
    Jesus Christ lives and that His infinite atonement for my sins and for the sins of all
    men, provide hope and eternal destiny for all of us.</p>
<p>We leave you with our love, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000099">Susan and I have been here before  when President Eyring presided
      here, and President Hafen, and President Bennion, and again last year when
      we were privileged to meet President and Sister Bednar. Two of our children have attended school here.
      Over the years we have watched the students and loved the spirit of
      this place. It is truly one of our favorite places to be.&nbsp; One day in the future you will look back and say, I don't think I
      realized while I was at BYUIdaho what an extraordinary place it was.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You can see that I have been thinking about you. I have prayed to know what I might say that you would find helpful
      right now, that you would want to learn and could use immediately to
      enhance your life. Thinking about that, Susan and I began talking about our 10 children.
      We wrote their names one after another and were almost overwhelmed to
      realize the miracles the Lord has worked in their lives. It might surprise you to learn of the common denominator in each of
      those miracles. Each miracle helped them in some way to start seeking <u>on their own</u>
      to learn and live the gospel. At the point this happens a person has grown up, and is on his or her
      way to true success in life and eternal life hereafter. That's when parents can start breathing just a little easier.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let me tell you of a season of my life when I came to appreciate, just
      a bit the blessings that come when we start seeking for eternal things of
      our own free will. This happened about 41 years ago, after I had returned from my mission.
      I found myself in the Army, having been given a choice between being
      drafted for a longer period or enlisting for a shorter one. I enlisted. Part of the time I was assigned to a company full of men who also
      entered the army by choice  only in their case it was a choice a judge
      gave them either to go into the army or go to prison. You can imagine having to deal with the hostilities of men who were
      offended by the sight of a barracks mate kneeling in prayer by his bed and
      carrying the scriptures around with him. And to top it off, part of the time I was extremely ill with a staff
      infection throughout my body. Yet I count my time in the Army as one of the great seasons of my life,
      even when the surrounding conditions got ugly. For I was caught up day and night in the scriptures.
      I would plan each weekend to leave the base when I could get off duty
      and absorb myself completely in what some people might think a very
      strange project. The project was to arrange the scriptures by topic according to a
      scheme I had worked out in my mind, beginning with the creation and the
      placing of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. No one had assigned me to do this or even suggested it.
      I did it because of my hunger to learn.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In those days we had no computers or even copy machines. If you wanted a copy of something, you typed it or wrote it out by
      hand. How was I to get copies of the many, many pages of scripture I wanted
      to arrange? I didnt even have a typewriter. I purchased several paperback copies of the scriptures, cut the
      passages out that I wanted  with two copies I could get both sides of
      the page  and then pasted them on sheets in the desired order.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Where could I work on such a project? Each weekend that I could leave the base I rented an inexpensive hotel
      room, pushed the bed into a corner, stacked the other furniture on the
      bed, and laid out all the cut-up passages on the floor. I would work for hours, late at night and then early in the morning,
      stopping to go to Church.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It would be hard to describe the excitement I felt during these
      studious hours. The further I got into the project, the faster the insights came, and
      the more on fire I felt. I discovered that after I had studied for a while my appetite for
      spiritual things did not diminish, the way physical appetite does after we
      have eaten a certain amount. It grew. I hungered for the things of God more than ever before in my life.
      And I felt the Lords Spirit with me. It daily accompanied me into very difficult circumstances, guiding and
      protecting me.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">From this experience I grew in my understanding of the principle that I
      desire to share with you today. The principle is this:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Stepping out on our own to do whats right, to obey the commandments 
		<u>of
      our own free will</u>, to go <u>beyond</u> the minimum thats expected
       this draws into our lives the delivering and sustaining power of God. This power enlivens our spirit, imbues us with confidence, enlarges our
      understanding, and fills us with love. People who are lukewarm in gospel activity may think they understand
      how liberally and mercifully the Lord works with and blesses His children,
      but they dont. For the Lord doesnt show his strength to sustain and prosper His
      children unless they are striving to obey and serve Him (Hel. 7:23 etc.).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This principle I recently heard expressed in different words by Elder
      Enzio Busche. I am going to call it, the principle of initiative and diligence.
      The way I state it here expands on what I heard Elder Busche say.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>When we take a responsible step to do what is right or sacrifice
      what is wrong, there flows to us, often immediately, a quiet confirmation
      from the Spirit of the Lord that we are doing right, and encouragement and
      strength to keep going.</i> <i>If we start doing any of the things we have been commanded to do, we
      will be given strength to persist, and our persistence will bring us more
      strength.</i> <i>What the Lord contributes is infinitely greater than what we
      contribute, but it comes to us only by <u>our</u> initiative and
      diligence.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To me it seems important to have a clear understanding of these two
      words Initiative. An introductory action or step. A willing, decisive action that starts something going.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Diligence. Constant, attentive, persistent effort to accomplish something.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Diligence, you may be interested to know, comes from a word
      meaning to choose or to like something  diligence implies caring very
      much about what we are doing.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You may wonder whether the principle of initiative and diligence can be
      found in the scriptures. Yes. In fact it appears there so often that it's easy to overlook: like the
      air we breathe. The Savior taught:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I will give you just a few of many instances. The Book of Mormon begins with the initiative of Lehi &quot;as he went
      forth and prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, on behalf of
      his people.&quot; Then there is the mighty vision in which Nephi was given the
      interpretation of his fathers inspired dream of the tree of life, the
      iron rod, the Saviors ministry, and so much more. This Nephi received because he desired to see and hear and know for
      himself what his father had received, and sat pondering these things in
      his heart. At one point Nephi wrote,&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed art
      thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently,
      with lowliness of heart. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You will remember the spiritual initiative of Enos. In the midst of a hunting trip he stopped to ponder the truths his
      father had taught him, and to pray all day long and into the night. By so doing he obtained forgiveness of his sins and great promises for
      his people and for the Lamanites. The sons of Mosiah also acted on their own initiative when they
      renounced any claim they might have had to succeed their father as king
      and asked instead to serve a mission in the land of their enemies, the
      Lamanites. The result of their labors, which lasted 14 years, was that many
      thousands were saved in the kingdom of God. Those four brothers are role models of initiative and diligence.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and
      fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of
      revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of
      God.&quot; </i>(Mosiah 17.2-3)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The prophet Joseph took the first small step that launched the
      Restoration of the gospel when he quietly arose from his bed one Spring
      morning and walked a short way into the woods to ask of God which Church
      was right and to learn of his standing before God. The great majority of the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants
      came as answers to questions and requests from the Prophet as he studied
      the scriptures and administered the affairs of the kingdom. These are just a few examples of many
       I haven't mentioned the 2,000
      stripling warriors  it was <u>their</u> idea to risk their lives in
      defense of their people  or Moroni, whose life is one bold move after
      another, or Teancum, or the brothers Nephi and Lehi, or any of the others.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">With this principle of initiative and diligence in mind, I would like
      to share with you my diagnosis of a moral disease that was widespread when
      I was your age but has become an epidemic now. I call it the &quot;This is just the way I am&quot; syndrome.
      Have you ever heard anyone talk this way?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&quot;I dont think Ill try to make any new friends while Im
      here; I have a hard time relating to people.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;I cant get really interested in Relief Society (or home
      teaching or scripture reading)  thats just the way I am, I
      guess.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;I dont much like really religious girls  its just
      something about me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;Maybe I wont go on a mission (or get married, or go to
      college)  Im just not the type.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Surely you have seen manifestations of this &quot;syndrome.&quot; It afflicts people who stay stuck in their present habits and patterns
      by telling themselves, &quot;This is just the way I am.&quot; They dont become different because they use the way they are now as
      an excuse.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Here are a few more samples  I could never do manual labor. People dont especially like me.
      I cant cook. I dont like my parents. Sacrament meeting is boring to me.
      Im not much of a student. If the bishop asks me to speak in Sacrament meeting, I think Ill
      die. No one whos popular would want to go out with me.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My daughter is Relief Society president in her BYU ward. She shared with me a talk by President Spencer W. Kimball, the twelfth
      president of the church. He intended his words for the instruction of the young adults of the
      Church. He spoke specifically of the initiatives we must take, if necessary, in
      order to fulfill the commandment to enter into the new and everlasting
      covenant of marriage. But his counsel applies just as much to obeying the other commandments,
      such as preparing for a career that will enable us to provide for our
      family, or becoming a good spouse or parent, or an effective church worker
      or contributor to the community. In each case, the responsibility falls upon
		<u>us</u> to find what <u>we</u>
      must do to obey and then to take the initiative and to act diligently. Excusing ourselves from obeying the commandments for 
		<u>any</u> reason
      is not acceptable. We should not hold ourselves back because obedience will require too
      much commitment, sacrifice, and hard work, or even because we are afraid.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Said President Kimball,&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000080">&quot;Are you too talkative? Too withdrawn? Too quiet? If so, then school your thoughts and your expressions.</font></i></p>
<p><i><font color="#000080">&quot;Are you in the wrong location? Could a move to a new location open up a new world to you?</font></i></p>
<p><i><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&quot;Is your dress. . . too revealing or too extreme? Are you too demanding?
      Do you have any eccentricities in speech, in tone, in subject matter? Do you laugh too loudly?
      Are you too demonstrative? Are you selfish? Are you honorable in all things?
      . . . Do you feel sorry for [yourself?]</font></i></p>
<p><i><font color="#000080">&quot;Have you made yourself attractive physically  well-groomed, well-dressed
       and attractive mentally  engaging, interesting?
      Are you well-read? If not, change yourself.&quot;</font></i></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Take the responsible step, President Kimball is counseling. There are no excuses for failing to claim the blessings the Lord has
      for you. If you dont take those steps, if you let circumstances shape your
      destiny, you will <u>never</u> have the growth or the employment or the
      associates or the marriage or the family or the eternal crown you <u>would</u>
      have had if only you had stepped out boldly to do everything you could to
      obey the commandments.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My daughter laughed with delight when she read me President Kimballs
      words. They expect so much. Theyre so bold theyre startling. They hold out high expectations boldly because theyre spoken by a
      prophet motivated by a love similar to the Lords love. The message in them is: You must use your agency.
      You must take the initiative to claim your blessings. Work diligently at becoming a Christ-like person.
      Then the help from heaven comes. No one would expect to become a financier or a doctor or a literature
      teacher or a coach without a great deal of training and practice. And no one should expect to become a disciple of Christ without even
      more training, practice, and discipline.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When I was your age, in school like you, I had a home teaching
      companion who had a great influence upon me, because the Spirit of the
      Lord was with him. I will call him, Dan. You felt in his presence his great integrity.
      You felt you wanted to draw close to the Lord because you could see in
      Dan what happens to people who do.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One day Dan said he would like to talk with me. We sat down on the lawn in the summertime in front of my apartment.
      He told me of having been so fearful of people when growing up, that he
      completely missed the experiences and development enjoyed by other young
      people. He was not active in the Church in those years and confessed to having
      been very arrogant intellectually and hardened in his heart. He hinted at having gotten into some kind of trouble.
      His face bore a mild disfigurement that may have contributed to his
      many problems.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Somewhere in his late teenage years he discovered the gospel. He received a very strong testimony of the Savior.
      And this immediately confronted him with a problem. He was in no condition to be a Latter-day Saint!
      Latter-day Saints welcome one another, smile, and shake hands. He had never done these things.
      In fact the thought of doing them made him quake with fear. Latter-day Saints speak in Church.
      They give lessons when they go home or visiting teaching. They attend youth dances.
      They sing in choirs and around the campfire. They play softball, basketball, and volleyball in Church outings or
      stake leagues. The young men bless the Sacrament. He had avoided ever doing any of these.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Add to these daunting obstacles the usual challenges facing new converts, like learning to pray, beginning to tithe, and abandoning bad
      habits, and you can see that the mountain looming before Dan must have
      seemed impossible to climb. Nevertheless, he made a list of everything he needed to accomplish in
      order to become a genuine, functional, normal Latter-day Saint. As I recall, the list included 25 major items.
      One, I think the first, was to look straight at a person he was passing
      on campus and smile and say &quot;Hello.&quot; He prepared himself a long time emotionally and spiritually for this.
      He tried to pump up his courage. And after a few unsuccessful tries, he did it.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The next challenges included learning to dance  which of course meant
      standing face to face with an actual live girl and touching her hand and
      back  Aaagh! But he worked hard to master this skill and finally danced at a Church
      event. And playing softball, which took getting people to practice with him
      for long hours. And singing in a group. And giving a talk in church, and so on.
      As the feats of Hercules might be to other men, so were these simple
      acts to him.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The product of the initiatives and the diligence I have described was
      this inspiring young man sitting before me on the lawn, a man of mighty
      spiritual backbone and courage who had obtained something I wanted to
      obtain for myself. Like those of the celestial kingdom, he was &quot;valiant in the
      testimony of Jesus&quot; (D&amp;C 76:79). He said he wanted to share his favorite scripture with me.
      He opened his New Testament and started reading at 1 Corinthians 1,
      verse 15 and continued through to the end of chapter 2. This passage testifies radiantly of living by the wisdom and power of
      the Spirit rather than by human power. Dan read those words of the Apostle Paul as if they were his
      autobiography; he used them to testify of what he had come to know for
      himself.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I will leave you to read this magnificent passage of scripture for yourself, and on this occasion share just a few selected lines.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>&quot;But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
      have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
      them that love him.</i> <i>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit. . . .</i></font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000080">Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which
      is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of
      God.&quot;</font></i></p>
<p><font color="#000080">(1 Cor. 2:3-4,9,12)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; you may say. &quot;But Ive tried to change and its too hard.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Examine that statement. It is not an explanation. Its an excuse. Remember the
      principle.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When we take a responsible step to do what is right and sacrifice what
      is wrong, there flows to us, often immediately, a quiet confirmation from
      the Spirit of the Lord that we are doing right, and encouragement and
      strength to keep going.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">So, if youve tried and failed to keep your belongings in order, or
      to study on a consistent basis so youre not cramming all the time, or
      to get yourself into good physical condition, or to conquer an anger
      problem or a gossip problem or a vulgarity problem  if youve not
      succeeded in your effort to make a change in some part of your life, then
      start with something smaller that you can do. For example, you might make make it your first responsible step to read
      the scriptures on your own, without having been given any assignment. Begin by falling on your knees and asking for understanding and
      increased desire. Or you might call or visit someone who needs your encouragement.
      Or your might take yourself somewhere else when that TV show is about
      to start that you know is a waste of time or worse. You take one step and then you take another.
      That is how your faith will grow to take even bigger steps than these. It is contrary to Gods great plan of love that we would be entrapped
      in sin and be able to find no way out.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Heres another suggestion. Before you start, count the cost. Recognize from the beginning that it wont be easy.
      Visualize in your mind the comforts you will have to forgo. Recognize that Satan will do everything imaginable to keep you from
      succeeding. As long as we are slouching around on the battlefield while peoples
      souls are being won and lost, he doesnt have to spend any effort to
      keep us from doing damage to his battle plan. But as soon as we rouse ourselves, he gets into a real fuss and focuses
      his big artillery on us.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">May I suggest one more strategy, this one for any who are finding it
      difficult to free themselves from the bondage of sin. Before we try to change we usually do not feel controlled by our sins.
      Often it is only when we make an effort to repent that we realize how
      tight their grip on us has been. My suggestion is that the principle of initiative and change applies
      just as much to ending these sins of <u>co</u>mmission as it does to
      ending sins of <u>o</u>mission. It applies whether the problem is gossip or gambling, lying or
      laziness, pride or pornography. And here is how it applies: You must <u>completely</u> avoid entertaining the sin in any form, even
      in thought.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A young woman came to me very discouraged. She said no one would ever consider marrying her.
      I asked how long she had thought that. She said ever since she entered her teenage years.
      I suggested that she could no longer risk indulging in that destructive
      thought. She couldnt let herself passively be its victim. She had to take the initiative to turn her mind away from it whenever
      it drew into sight. She needed to treat this thought it like the swords of the Anti-Nephi-Lehi
      Lamanite converts  she had to bury it and never touch it again. Otherwise, her battle with it would never end.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A man spoke with me about how he had been troubled for a decade with
      impure thoughts. He described his unsuccessful efforts to use all his strength to
      control these thoughts when they would enter is mind and heart. I suggested the principle of initiative and diligence.
      He had to take up his cross, which the Savior said is &quot;for a man
      to . . . deny himself of all ungodliness, and every worldly lust, and to
      keep my commandments&quot; (Matt. 16:24 JST). The man before me had to undertake an extraordinary vigilance.
      He had to turn away with his eyes and his mind <u>anytime</u> there was
      a possibility of such a thought. This meant taking care not to turn to a certain TV channel or open a
      particular internet site unless he absolutely knew it was safe. It meant choosing his route thorough a department store to avoid
      certain places. It meant quickly refocusing his mind if an unwanted thought started to
      form. I told him avoiding the very appearance of evil should be his watchword
       avoiding the appearance not just in the sense of shunning the things that look like evil, but
      also in the sense of turning away the instant that evil starts to appear.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The man took this suggestion, very prayerfully. Within a month he was making significant progress.
      After about a year he told me he felt clean. But, he added, &quot;I must keep the sword buried; I 
		<u>cannot risk</u>
      ever getting myself into that awful torment again.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">On these subjects the words of Moroni can inspire us.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;Come&quot; and &quot;lay hold&quot;  those are words that connote initiative and diligence.
      &quot;Touch not&quot; does too. You cant be half-hearted and keep this instruction.
      You have to take bold, determined steps and keep on taking them.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I bear witness to you, from my personal experience, that putting our
      whole heart into learning and living the gospel draws the Spirit of the
      Lord into our lives, with stirring power. We feel filled as if with fire to worship God and learn of His ways,
      and serve Him, from hour to hour. And another thing happens. Our confidence begins to &quot;wax strong&quot; before God (D &amp; C
      121:45), a lively hope awakens within us confirming that we are on the course to
      eternal life, and we feel we are being given what the Doctrine and
      Covenants calls, &quot;grace and assurance wherewith [we] may stand&quot;
      (106:8). We want to talk of Christ and rejoice in Christ, and tell others of
      what He is able and willing to do for all his children.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Susan and I have watched your generation very closely and I am convinced that many of you are living this way now.
      We see that grace and assurance in your humility and in your
      confidence. We recognize the Spirit that you bear.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let me close with a story about one of you, a young man who does not
      live in circumstances anywhere near as favorable as ours, but in whose
      heart the Lord has put His law and His love.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Nathan Rawlins met Lwany Nicholas when Nicholas gave a magnificently
      simple and powerful talk in Sacrament Meeting in Moss, Norway. After church, Nicholas, who is from Uganda, invited Nathan to the
      refugee camp where he lived and where he was preparing other camp members
      to receive the gospel. He had fled from his native country four years earlier, at age 17,
      because his politics made it unsafe for him to be there. The government had killed his parents, leaving his brothers and sisters
      to look out for themselves. And now he occupied a room the size of a walk-in closet, with worldly
      possessions that fit easily into a small duffel bag, waiting to learn
      whether Norway would grant him political asylum. With his wide smile and bright eyes he exuded his testimony of the
      Gospel of Christ, which was the greatest thing in his life. He was enthusiastically preparing to go to the temple.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When Elder Rawlins and his companion returned a few days after their
      initial visit, they learned from Nicholas that he was being deported to
      Uganda; the Norwegian government had decided it was no longer unsafe for
      him to go back. In his particular case, as all Ugandan expatriates knew, the prospects
      were in fact not hopeful at all. He expected to be shot when he got off the airplane.
      &quot;The thing that struck me most,&quot; said Elder Rawlins,
      &quot;was the look in his eye. The gleam that had been there the day of his talk was if anything
      stronger. He was calm and strong. I could not understand how a person who had so little in this world
      could radiate such peace.&quot; Nicholas suggested that they all sign their names in each others
      scriptures next to their favorite verse. Nicholas put his signature by Ether 12:4.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Nicholas was not shot, but detained in a military camp, tortured
      physically and mentally, and deprived even of his beloved Book of Mormon. Later he was released, frail and weak from his imprisonment, and, for
      political reasons, forbidden to work, even though he had responsibility to
      provide for his siblings and a young woman he hoped to marry. That, which was communicated in the one letter Brother Rawlins has
      received from him since they parted, is all that is known of his fate.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">If any of us here, during this hour together, has felt a spiritual
      nudge to take an initiative that will lead to these blessings, my hope is
      that we will go straightway and do it, and after that keep pressing
      forward with diligence.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Lord <u>made this promise available</u> to us by sacrificing
      everything for us. We can <u>bring about its fulfillment</u> by sacrificing everything
      required in order to obey and follow Him and bring others souls to partake
      of His redeeming love.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I bear my testimony to you today-a simple, humble member of the Church of the
Living Christ. For centuries, many people have not believed in Him. And many who
have believed in Him thought of Him as a kind of great watchmaker who created
the world, wound it up, and then left it to its own devices. Nothing could be
further from the truth. The Savior is involved with us with initiative and
diligence, concern and love, and a sacrifice of everything. He has made
available to us the promises we have talked about today that we might become as
he is purified from all sin and filled with love, desirous to do good and
joyous in it, and capable of blessing our brothers and sisters because of the
priesthood and of the Spirit of God which we can have. What is required of us
that we, too, sacrifice for Him and for his other children so that we may
realize this promise, this blessing, that he has given us. I bear witness of
Him, my love of Him and of His Church, and of this life, and all that He has
given us in the Name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

Women's Week Message<br />

<p>	I feel blessed to be here.  Seeing mothers and daughters and sons together is such a
thrill.  Some of you may have noticed that your students weren't telling tall tales about the
weather in Rexburg.  Until today I'm sure you thought they were just exaggerating.  I've
heard it said that Rexburg is a place where you can wear all of your favorite clothes all in one
day, all at one time!</p>
<p>	Before the moms come to campus, I always visit with students to ask them questions
about your visit to campus.  I learn a lot about the students from the questions I ask.  I asked
one young man, "Are you letting your cupboard get really bare before your mother comes?" 
He said, "Oh, I'd be so embarrassed if my mom had to buy me food.  It would make me feel
so guilty."  I thought, "Where did you come from?  You need to be my son."  I went to
parents' weekend at Brigham Young University this past fall, and my pocketbook was empty
when I came home.</p>
<p>	I visited with another young woman I met at the grocery store and asked, "Why are
you buying food before your mom comes?"  She said, "I just thought my mom would like
something for breakfast."  I looked down on the conveyor belt.  Mom, I sure hope you like
Lucky Charms with Marshmallow Pies for breakfast!</p>
<p>	I would like to express thanks to Sister Kris Fillmore and all the young women who
have served to make this weekend possible.  Would you please stand so we can acknowledge
you?   Thank you for all you have done.  These young women and many more besides have
spent weeks and months planning and preparing for this weekend.  We hope you mothers are
lifted up and spiritually filled while you are here at Ricks College.</p>
<p>	I've been asked to introduce the theme for Women's Week, <em>For Such a Time as This</em>,
taken from the story of Esther.  This story is filled with intrigue and twists of irony that
capture one's interest.  Though I have time to recount only a brief synopsis, I hope you will
make an effort to read the entire account in the book of Esther.  I pray for the Spirit of the
Holy Ghost to be with us today and for help to present my thoughts and feelings.  Let me
refresh your memory about Esther. </p>
<p>	Esther was a beautiful young woman whose parents had passed away when she was a
little girl.  She was raised by her cousin, Mordecai, who treated her as if she was his own
daughter.  Mordecai learned that King Ahasueras was searching among the beautiful maidens
of his kingdom for a new queen.  Mordecai took Esther to the king's palace for the king's
consideration and advised her not to reveal her Jewish nationality.  Eventually Esther found
favor with the king and was crowned as his new queen.</p>
<p>	Mordecai walked daily outside the gates of the palace so he could see how Esther was
doing and what had become of her.  According to the king's commandment, everyone was to
bow down to Haman, the king's powerful prince, whenever he entered the palace gates. 
Because Mordecai refused to bow before Haman, Haman was angry.  In his vengeance Haman
deceitfully persuaded the king to send out an edict that all Jews in the kingdom should be
killed.</p>
<p>	When Mordecai learned of this plot, he sent word to Esther requesting that she go
before the king, reveal her Jewish identity, and beg the king to spare the lives of her people.  
But Esther faced a major problem.  She was not allowed to approach the king unless he called
for her.  To go into his courtyard without an invitation meant instant death, unless the king
held out his golden scepter to her signaling she could come to him.</p>
<p>	Esther debated with Mordecai about this dilemma.  She realized her responsibility as
the only person who could save her people.  Mordecai's question concerning her destiny
resounded in her ears:  "Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time
as this?" (Esther 4:14).</p>
<p>	Esther solicited the help of Mordecai, her chambermaids, and the Jews of the city.  She
asked them to join her in a fast for three days.  Then Esther beautified and prepared herself to
approach the king.  Her courageous parting words were, ". . . I will go in unto the king,
which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish" (Esther 4:16).</p>
<p>	We know that Esther was successful in her attempt to save her people.  Her story is
one of courage, faith, and understanding.</p>
<p>	As I have read, studied, and pondered this powerful biblical story, I have asked myself
this question, "What can we learn from this heroine of the scriptures?"</p>
<p>	May I share three important points I have gleaned from this account and illustrate their
application in our day and time with some personal examples?</p>
<p> <strong><em>Point #1:</em></strong>  Like Esther, we need courage to reveal our true identity and stand tall as
women of God.</p>
<p>	While serving as a Lambda Delta Sigma sorority adviser, I became better acquainted
with a young woman whom I had known for many, many years.  Katie was a student majoring
in kinesiology.  Her course work for her master's degree consisted of four years of class work
followed by a one-year, unpaid internship in the public schools.</p>
<p>	During the final semester of her internship, a paid position in the school district where
she was interning became available.  Katie's supervising professor thought highly of Katie's
abilities and talents and was grooming her for this job.  He called her into his office and
primed her for the questions that would be asked in the selection process.  This professor
knew Katie's hopes and dreams for the future but informed her that in order to get the job she
must profess that having a career was her main ambition, teaching was her primary focus, and
marriage and family were not in her plans for a while.</p>
<p>	Well, Katie went to the interview.  The questions were posed.  But when Katie was
asked what she pictured herself doing in five years, she expressed her true feelings.  She said,
"I hope to be married, have a baby, and be a stay-at-home mother."</p>
<p>	I saw Katie the evening after she was interviewed.  She felt she had blown her chances
to be hired by her candid and honest answers, but she took solace in the fact that she had
remained true to her heartfelt desires.  The next week Katie was shocked by being offered the
position.  </p>
<p>	It's been five years now since Katie had that interview.  I received a Christmas card
from her a few months ago.  She was married in the Saint Louis Temple about four years ago
and is now the proud mother of a little boy.  Like Esther, Katie was not afraid of revealing her
true identity.  She is a courageous young daughter of God and a member of The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who is committed to stand as a witness of God at all times
and in all things and in all places--no matter what the consequences.</p>
<p> <strong><em>Point #2:</em></strong>  Esther had faith in the power of fasting.  We, too, can find spiritual strength
and seek for blessings through this gospel principle.</p>
<p>	Years ago, I was taught a powerful example about the importance of fasting from a
small child.  I was a newly married and inexperienced first grade teacher.  Our class had been
studying a unit on the five senses, and the day we were discussing the sense of taste was going
to be a fun day!  Each child was assigned to bring something to school for our "tasting party."
We were planning to sample foods that were salty, foods that were bitter, foods that were
sour, foods that were sweet, etc.</p>
<p>	During our activity I noticed that six-year-old Chad wasn't eating any of the food. 
When I asked if he was feeling well, he responded that he was fine.  He just didn't want to
eat.  I kept encouraging him to get involved.  Finally he said, "Mrs. Bednar, I'm fasting."
With tears welling up in his eyes he said, "My grandpa is having surgery today and our family
is fasting for him."</p>
<p>	Well, you can imagine how bad I felt playing the devil's advocate.  What self-mastery
and faith this young child exhibited.  Unique and good-tasting food surrounded him, and his
classmates were having a great time.  Yet he abstained from it all.  I've never forgotten this
experience with Chad.  I always wanted to meet his mother.  She must have been an amazing
woman to instill in her son such a testimony of fasting.  Both she and Chad knew the spiritual
strength that comes from the fast.</p>
<p> <strong><em>Point #3:</em></strong>  Like Esther, life's seemingly insignificant experiences and circumstances
prepare us for our "such a time as this."</p>
<p>	Two years ago during Women's Week President Bednar and I received a sad, sad
phone call.  A former neighbor and dear friend's husband died unexpectedly of a heart attack
while they were on a business and pleasure trip in mainland China.  We flew back to our
previous home for the funeral.  As I tenderly watched my friend and her family during the
funeral services, I felt impressed that her life had been a preparation "for such a time as this."</p>
<p>	To me, it wasn't coincidence that she and her husband had joined the Church early in
their married life.  They always commented how gospel covenants had blessed their marriage
and their family.  It wasn't coincidence that while her husband's Army Reserve unit had been
called to serve for more than six months in the Gulf War, she was left to care for her family
alone.  It wasn't coincidence that he was called again to serve overseas for almost a year
during the Bosnian conflict.  Each time he was away, I watched her deal with difficult
problems and challenges.  But she faced them with faith and gained confidence in her ability to
manage the affairs of her family.</p>
<p>	Her youngest son was serving a mission at the time of his father's death.  I don't
believe it was coincidence that this father had a consulting trip that took him to South America
where his son was serving.  With permission from the mission president, this father and son
were able to spend their last day together doing missionary work.  The hand of the Lord had
been involved in the lives of these friends for many years, and they were prepared, as was
Esther, "for such a time as this."</p>
<p>	We, too, have been prepared for our day and our time.  A statement from President
Gordon B. Hinckley reinforces this idea:</p>
<p>		My brethren and sisters, do you realize what we have?  Do you
recognize our place in the great drama of human history?  This is the focal point
of all that has gone before.  This is the season of restitution.  These are the days
of restoration.  This is the time when men from over the earth come to the
mountain of the Lord's house to seek and learn of His ways and to walk in His
paths.  This is the summation of all of the centuries of time since the birth of
Christ to this present and wonderful day.</p>
<p>		. . . For some reason unknown to us, but in the wisdom of God, we
have been privileged to come to earth in this glorious age. . . .  (President
Gordon B. Hinckley, Ensign, November 1999, p. 74)</p>
<p>	And may I add, "For such a time as this."</p>
<p>	Parents, particularly you mothers, as you sit by your son or daughter today, would you 
reminisce with me for just a moment.  Take your mind back to the day when you first held
this Ricks College student in your arms.  What were your hopes?  What were your dreams? 
Remember the bedtime stories you've read, the "owies" you've kissed and made better, the
messes you've cleaned up?  Think back on the day you observed your son passing the
sacrament for the first time or watched his quivering lip or heard his trembling voice as he
opened his mission call.  Recall the Sunday your daughter went to Young Women as a
twelve-year-old Beehive or the day you saw her leave the house on her first date.  Remember
the home evenings, the early morning scripture study, the late-night talks, the family prayers,
and the tears you've shed for their welfare through the years.</p>
<p>	Now look at these children sitting beside you.  While here at Ricks College they have
been stretched; they've grown.  They have become well-anchored in their testimonies of the
Savior.  They are valiant.  They are strong.  They are true.  And you've made it possible for
them to "come to the kingdom for such a time as this" (Esther 4:14).    </p>
<p>	May each of you relish this time you have together this weekend.  May you use the
time wisely.  May you recall past memories as well as visit about the future.  I hope you
students will write down the thoughts and feelings you have during this weekend while you are
with your mothers.  Someday you will want to revisit these special days you've had with your
moms.  The thoughts and feelings you record will give you hope, will give you strength, and
will remind you that your mother has stood tall as a woman of God.  She has equipped you
with spiritual tools that can give you strength during times that are tough.  And she has helped
prepare you to be a part of the kingdom "for such a time as this."</p>
<p>	Like Esther, may we stand tall, with courage to reveal our true identity as disciples of
the Lord Jesus Christ.  May we all seek for spiritual strength and realize our great purpose in
our Heavenly Father's divine plan, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><font color="#004040">FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS<br />
President David A. Bednar<br />
Women's Week Welcome Address<br />
March 16, 2001<br />
</font></strong><font color="#004040"><font color="#004040" size="2">©</font></font><font size="2" color="#004040">2001 by Ricks College. All rights
    reserved</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Sisters and brethren, it is a pleasure to be here with you today.  I, like Sister Bednar,
pray for the companionship and assistance of the Holy Ghost in the few minutes I will visit
with you.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Sister Bednar has done a remarkable job of reviewing the story of Esther and the theme
"For Such a Time as This."  May I suggest that at Ricks College, soon to become Brigham
Young University-Idaho, we are living in "such a time as this."  A miraculous thing has
occurred on this campus beginning on June 21 of last year.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	As I have considered what I might discuss with you today, I have tried to identify a
series of lessons or principles we have learned as an institution since last June that might be
applied to each of us as individuals.  I would like to highlight four such lessons.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	The first lesson is this: <strong>Changes can come into our lives quickly and unexpectedly
reminding us of who truly is in charge.</strong> </font> </p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	May I share a personal experience.  It was indicated in the introduction that Susan and
I and our family came to Ricks College in 1997.  We received a phone call in April of that
year inviting us to come to Salt Lake City to interview for the position.  We were notified on
the Friday before Memorial Day in May of 1997 that we would be moving to Rexburg.  In the
four weeks that intervened between the time we were notified and my first day on the job on
June 28, I resigned my position as a faculty member at the University of Arkansas; I closed
my business as a management consultant and concluded the contracts I had with all of my
clients; we spent two weeks in Finland picking up our oldest son from his mission; we put our home on the market for sale; we began to pack and make all of our preparations to leave a
place we believed would be our home until the time we would die; and we did a number of
other things that I cannot recall.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	We went from a state of contentment to one of total chaos in a matter of minutes. 
Everything that was secure and predictable and expected in our lives, in just a matter of
moments, was totally and completely turned upside down.  Our experience is made even more
interesting by the fact that the first time I ever saw Ricks College, the first time I ever stepped
foot on this campus, was the day Sister Bednar and I were introduced to the faculty and staff. 
Everything we knew and loved and felt secure with was gone, and we were in a place I had
never been before.  Susan grew up near here in Star Valley, Wyoming, and she had been to
Ricks College on a few occasions; but this was not an overly familiar place for her.  I did not
come here as a student; I did not know a thing about the school.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	In the middle of July of 1997, I flew back to Arkansas.  We completed the packing of
our possessions, and the moving van drove away.  In our van and another car, we made the
trip across the country to Rexburg, Idaho.  I will never forget driving across the United States. 
It was very close to the time of the Sesquicentennial celebration, and I compared us driving
along in our magnificent automobiles to what the pioneers must have done.  And one thing that
came to my mind was: &quot;David, you are 44 years old.  You have always thought you were in
control.  You thought you had planned a career.  You thought you were making appropriate
provisions temporally for your family and planning for the future."  And what I learned as I
drove was: "I never was in control."  And it was the suddenness and the unexpectedness of
the changes in our lives that helped me to learn that lesson.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	As Sister Bednar and I now look back, we see a pattern of shaping and directing in our
lives.  Just as Susan talked about our dear friend who lost her husband (and there had been
years and years of preparation), there had been years and years of preparation for this
tumultuous change that occurred in our lives.  And only because of the suddenness of the
change did we truly realize that we were never in control.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	For members of the Church, change causes uncertainty as it does for everyone else.  It
causes anxiety as it does for anyone else.  But for us as members of The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, the true lesson is to be reminded of who ultimately is in control
and the need for submission to "His will" and not "my will."  I hope I will never forget that
lesson.  It also has occurred to me that I could not be the president of this institution in a time
such as this if our family had not experienced precisely the sudden, very unexpected, and very
significant change in our personal lives.  There may be a few who would say, "President
Bednar does not understand.  Change is not happening in his life."  May I simply say, "I
understand better than they might have any idea."  And it was one of the necessary
requirements in preparation to be here in this role as president at a time such as this.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Let me suggest two scriptures.  You may want to jot down these references so you can
refer to them at another time.  The first is Alma 37:37.  You will note on the screen I have
highlighted an element of this verse that is very significant:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and <strong>he will direct thee</strong> for
good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may
watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart
be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the
last day (emphasis added).</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	From the Doctrine and Covenants, section 112, verse 10:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall <strong>lead thee by the hand</strong>, and give
thee answer to thy prayers (emphasis added).</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Just a reminder, brothers and sisters, that sudden, unexpected changes can come into
our lives and serve as a powerful reminder of who truly is in charge.  They certainly can be,
they certainly should be such reminders, if we have the eyes to see and the ears to hear.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	The second lesson growing out of what is occurring presently at this institution that has
application for each of us as individuals is this:  <strong>Prophets and revelators indeed are
prophets and revelators</strong>.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Last Wednesday I spent much of the morning with President Gordon B. Hinckley in a
Board of Trustees meeting.  He is healthy; he is alert; he is energetic; he grows, in my
estimation, more powerful each time I see him in those settings.  And he has the most
remarkable ability.  It does not make any difference what the issue is, what the proposal being
discussed is, what the analysis being reviewed is, no matter how long one has prepared, he can
always ask the one question you have been praying he will not ask.  And then you always have
a "deer in the headlights" experience.  (Have you ever experienced that?)  He wants to make
sure that you have done the spiritual and the temporal homework for what is being presented. 
He is indeed a prophet.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	The first verse I would like to highlight to emphasize this lesson that prophets and
revelators indeed are prophets and revelators is Doctrine and Covenants, section 1, verse 38:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself;
and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away,
[now note these next several lines] but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine
own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	May I suggest it is no small thing that President Gordon B. Hinckley did not delegate
the announcement of Ricks College becoming Brigham Young University-Idaho to his
counselors or to Elder Henry B. Eyring who serves as the commissioner of education.  It was
literally his voice, and the announcement included changing the name of the institution and
eliminating intercollegiate athletics.  ". . . Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my
servants, it is the same."</font> </p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	In 1 Nephi 22:2, reference is made to the plates and the preservation of the scriptures.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And I, Nephi, said unto them:  Behold they [they is referring to the
sacred writings] were manifest unto the prophet by the voice of the Spirit; for
by the Spirit are all things made known unto the prophets, which shall come
upon the children of men according to the flesh.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	I emphasize the word "all."</font> </p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	The next reference comes from the Doctrine and Covenants:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words
and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking
in all holiness before me;</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all
patience and faith.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you;
yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you,
and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory. 
(D&amp;C&nbsp;21:4-6)</font> </p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Brothers and sisters, these promises about properly heeding the counsel of the president
of the Church apply both to individuals and institutions.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	I have been studying lately all of the statements I can find by prophets pertaining to the
mission and the role of Brigham Young University.  Please think about the verses we have just
read, and now consider with me several statements by President Spencer W. Kimball in light
of what is occurring in Rexburg, Idaho, in such a time as this.  These statements were made
more than 25 years ago.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		In some ways, the Church Educational System, in order to be unique in
the years that lie ahead, [now note this line] <strong>may have to break with certain
patterns of the educational establishment</strong>.  When the world has lost its way
on matters of principle, we have an obligation to point the way.  We can, as
Brigham Young hoped we would, be a people of profound learning pertaining to
the things of this world but without being tainted by what he regarded as the
pernicious, atheistic influences that flood in unless we are watchful.  Our
scholars, therefore, must be sentries as well as teachers!  ("Second Century
Address," Founder's Day Convocation, October 10, 1975, emphasis added)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	This particular statement is especially interesting if you are familiar with the
fundamental elements of President Hinckley's announcement pertaining to Brigham Young
University-Idaho.  I only recently became aware of this statement by President Kimball. 
This statement is a very significant thing given the direction that has been outlined for
BYU-Idaho.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Let me share another quote from President Kimball.  Again, this statement was made in
1975:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		We can do much in excellence and, at the same time, <strong>emphasize the
large scale participation of our students whether it be in athletics or in
academic events</strong>.  We can bless many and give many experience while at the
same time we are developing the few select souls who can take us to new
heights of attainment.  (Ibid., emphasis added)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Here is another quote from President Kimball, again made in 1975.  Prophets and
revelators indeed are prophets and revelators.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		It ought to be obvious to you, as it is to me, that some of the things the
Lord would have occur in the second century of BYU are hidden from our
immediate view.  Until we have climbed the hill just before us, we are not apt
to be given a glimpse of what lies beyond.  The hills ahead are higher than we
think.  This means that accomplishments and <strong>further direction must occur in
proper order</strong> after we have done our part.  (Ibid., emphasis added)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Brothers and sisters, I hope we appreciate a time such as this and what we are
witnessing, what your children are participating in, and the marvelous things taking place on
this campus.  Continuing with President Kimball:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		We will not be transported from point A to point Z without having to
pass through the developmental and demanding experiences of all the points of
achievement and all the milestone markers that lie between!  (Ibid.)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	We have focused on prophets and seers and revelators and their role.  We have seen
specific statements from President Kimball that were made in 1975.  Now let's review the
following statement made by President Hinckley in our last general conference in October of
2000:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		In the past few months we have announced that Ricks College, a great
pioneer educational institution, hitherto providing a two-year degree, will be
expanded to provide four years of education and will carry the name
BYU-Idaho.  This in no way disparages the name of the great man for whom
the school was named.  This will enlarge the educational opportunities for many
young men and women.  It will make of what has been a great school an even
greater one.  It is an effort on the part of the Church to extend the opportunity
of secular education within the framework of a Church school, where is taught
faith in the Living God and in His divine Son, our Lord.  (<em>This Great Millennial
Year</em>, The Ensign, November 2000, p. 68)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	I simply conclude my comments about this lesson with my testimony.  I know by the
witness of the Spirit and by personal experience that prophets and revelators indeed are
prophets and revelators.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	The next lesson is this:  <strong>Manna is provided one day at a time</strong>.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	I do not know about you, but I have prayed on a number of occasions, "Couldn't I just
have a two-day supply?"  People ask me many questions about the transition and what is
coming at BYU-Idaho, and the answer is frequently, "We are working on it."  Could I just
have a two-day supply?  Over the past several months I have spent quite a bit of time studying
the scriptures about the consistent, steady, and incremental process for receiving help from
heaven.  I do not know about you, but I would really like it if the help would come all at once. 
But my experience suggests manna only comes one day at a time.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	There are great lessons to learn by studying manna.  Let me share several introductory
scriptures that highlight this incremental developmental process.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men
line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed
are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for
they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from
them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that
which they have.  (2 Nephi 28:30)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	The same principle is emphasized in the 64th section of the Doctrine and Covenants,
verses&nbsp;32 and 33:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		But all things must come to pass in their time.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation
of a great work.  And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	And from Alma:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto
you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small
means in many instances doth confound the wise.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and
eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and
bringeth about the salvation of many souls.  (Alma 37:6-7)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Now back to manna, which only comes one day at a time.  Let's review how this
significant substance was bestowed upon the children of Israel.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		This <em>is</em> the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it [meaning
the manna] every man according to his eating, an omer for every man <em>according
to</em> the number of your persons; take ye every man for <em>them</em> which <em>are</em> in his
tents.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And when they did mete <em>it</em> with an omer, he that gathered much had
nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man
according to his eating.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	What this phrase means is: Do not try to store it.  You receive a portion for the day. 
You will be preserved in that day.  You will have sufficient for the day.  But you must have
the faith to know that the manna will be provided again tomorrow.  Do not try to store it.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		Not withstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left
of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth
with them.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Here is the line I would like to emphasize:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating:
and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.  (Exodus 16:16, 18-21)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	"And they gathered it every morning."  What a great lesson for us to learn for such a
time as this!</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	There is a similar principle evident in Nephi building a ship.  Nephi did not grow up
near the ocean, and I do not think he knew much about ship building.  It is intriguing how he
was tutored and instructed by the Lord to build a ship.  In 1 Nephi, chapter 18, we learn:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And it came to pass that they did worship the Lord, and did go forth
with me; and we did work timbers of curious workmanship.  And the Lord did
show me from time to time after what manner I should work the timbers of the
ship.  (1 Nephi 18:1)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Can you see Nephi building this ship and his brothers mocking him?  "What's next?"
they taunt.  And he answers, "Well, I'm not sure; but the Lord will provide."</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Only enough manna comes for each day, and the portion for the day can be obtained
only in the morning.  Notice the same principle of gradual, constant, steady, and incremental
help from heaven.  In section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the
household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall
thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the
priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.  (D&amp;C&nbsp;121:45)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Have you ever gone outside at 3:30 in the morning to watch the dew distill and had the
experience of saying, "The dew arrived; it just came."  You could sit outside all night long
and never see the dew distilling.  It comes so gradually and so incrementally.  But as the sun
rises in the morning, as the rays of the sun shine on those little beads of dew, then we discern
and identify the dew.  The dew drops come in a way that is consistent, it is steady, it is
incremental, and it is paced.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Manna is provided only one day at a time.  It comes in the Lord's way, not our way. 
And I must tell you that I know of few lessons that are more helpful to me than to remember
manna comes every day.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	The last lesson I want to share with you is this:  <strong>Revelation comes as a conclusion not
as an explanation.</strong></font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	I would be wary, I would even be suspect, of someone who purports to have an
explanation for revelation.  I have never heard President Hinckley articulate, beyond what we
have reviewed in his quotes and in the official announcement, precisely the reason or reasons
why Ricks College is becoming Brigham Young University-Idaho.  It may be that even he
does not know all of the reasons why.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Let me use a rather simple example to illustrate this lesson.  We are walking along, and
the impression comes to turn left.  We do not know why.  "Ye receive no witness until after
the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6).  After we have turned left, after we have proceeded along
that pathway, then perhaps we gain some insight that answers the question of why.  Revelation
is a <strong><em>what</em></strong> and a <strong><em>conclusion</em></strong>; it is not a <strong><em>why</em></strong> and an <strong><em>explanation</em></strong>.  So there are many things that,
frankly, cannot be fully explained to the satisfaction of the rational mind.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Go back to the early 1980s and the time the announcement was made that the Hotel
Utah would no longer be used as a hotel and would be renovated by the Church.  Many cried,
"Why?  It will destroy business opportunities and the convention business in the downtown
area of Salt Lake City.  It will never be the same!"  Many were very outspoken and critical
that the Church would undertake such an action.  Go now to Temple Square, to the mall
between the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, the Conference Center, and the temple and tell
me a mistake was made.  Could all of the reasons have been articulated in the early 1980s? 
Absolutely not.  ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Line upon line, precept upon precept; here a little and there a little . .
." (D&amp;C 128:21).  Remember, manna comes one day at a time.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Here is a scriptural example of the fact that we do not always know why.  Adam and
Eve, when they were out of the garden, were commanded to offer sacrifice.  Listen to the
language in Moses, chapter 5:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And he gave unto them commandments, that they should worship the
Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an offering
unto the Lord.  And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: 
Why does thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord?  And Adam said unto him:  I
know not, save the Lord commanded me.  (Moses 5:5-6)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Then came the explanation:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the
sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth. 
(Moses 5:7)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Similar instruction is given by Elder Dallin H. Oaks.  Here is what he said:</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">		If you read the scriptures with this question in mind:  Why did the Lord
command this or why did he command that, you find that in less than 1 in a 100
commands was any reason given.  It's not the pattern of the Lord to give
reasons.  We can put reasons to revelation.  We can put reasons to
commandments.  When we do, we're on our own.  Let's don't make the
mistake that has been made in the past, trying to put reasons to revelation.  The
reasons turn out to be manmade to a great extent.  The revelations are what we
sustain as the will of the Lord, and that's where safety lies.  (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Provo Daily
Herald</span>, June 5, 1988, p. 21)</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	Brothers and sisters, there are great lessons we are learning as an institution during
"such a time as this" that can apply to each of us as individuals in these latter days.  I pray
that each of us will study and ponder and apply what we are learning here so we will live
faithfully and competently.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#004040">	I declare both my testimony and my witness.  I know God lives.  I know and witness
that Jesus is the Christ.  He lives.  He is real.  He knows us by name.  I know that the Holy
Ghost is a testator and a comforter and a teacher.  I know that Joseph Smith saw what he said
he saw.  I know that since the time of Joseph Smith there has been an unbroken succession of
presidents of the Church who hold all of the priesthood keys necessary to direct the affairs of
the kingdom of God.  And I know, I witness, I testify that Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord's
anointed spokesman on the earth today and that there are true messengers, even apostles and
prophets, on the earth today.  I testify of these things and declare my witness and pray for
God's choicest blessings to be with you, with your children, during your time here at
Women's Week and as we live in "such a time as this."  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

		Going to Black Africa</font></strong></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">I wish to speak about a unique and inspiring chapter in church history.  It took place in recent years
among the beautiful people of Africa.  Too often, we have misconceptions about Africa and its
people.  Africa is referred to as the "Dark Continent" and the media usually portrays Africans as
primitive, starving or at war with each other.  One African official observed that the darkest thing
about Africa is America's ignorance of it.</p>
<p>When I was in Africa several years ago, I was sent the following quote:   "In Africa there are tribes
that beat the ground with clubs while uttering spine chilling cries.  Anthropologists call this a
primitive form of self-expression.  But, in America we do the same thing but we call it GOLF!"&nbsp; 
		</p>
<p>President Gordon B.  Hinckley said, "The days of pioneering in the Church are still with us, they did not end with covered wagons and
handcarts.&nbsp; Pioneers are those individuals who help establish the Church all over the world."&nbsp; 
		</p>
<p>There is much
we can learn from our African brothers and sisters, who are among the great pioneers in this church. 
Most of the pioneers that I will focus on this afternoon were not members of the Church and we
knew very little about them.  I seek your faith and prayers that we might be edified by the example
of these great pioneers and by the assurance of God's love for all of his children. 
		</p>
<p>In 1853, six years after the Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley, the first missionaries were sent to
Africa, but they only proselyted among the white people of South Africa.  It was not until 125 years
later, following the revelation on the priesthood in 1978, that the gospel was able to be preached to
all people of Africa. However, thirty years before the revelation, church leaders became aware of
black Africans who were interested in the Church.  By the 1950's, many letters were sent to church
headquarters from the west African nations of Nigeria and Ghana, requesting literature and
membership in the Church.  The letters were written by devout Christians who had gained a
testimony from the Book of Mormon or other church literature.</p>
<p>What began as a comparative trickle of requests in the early 1950's became a flood by the 1960's. 
More letters requesting church literature were received from Nigeria and Ghana than from all the rest
of the world combined.  The Church responded by sending literature, but the demand was so great
that some Africans even established LDS bookstores.  However, since there were no priesthood
holders to preside and provide priesthood ordinances, those asking for baptism were told:   "The time
is not yet.  You must wait."</p>
<p>As they waited, they shared their knowledge and testimony of the gospel with others and organized
congregations.  It was reported that in the 1960's there were over sixty congregations in Nigeria and
Ghana, with more than 16,000 participants, none of whom were baptized. This was a paradox for
the church.  With an army of missionaries eager to go to the ends of the earth to teach and baptize,
there were thousands in Africa pleading to join the Church whom we were not able to baptize.  As
far as is known, nothing like this has occurred in this or in any other dispensation.   The intensity of
their pleadings continued to increase, as reflected in this letter to President David O.  McKay from
a pastor in Nigeria who had made previous requests for baptism.  He wrote: </p>
<p><i>"I have to say that my heart will not rest ...until I achieve my objective to be a baptized member of
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to receive the gift of the   Holy Ghost...  and to be
fully instructed in the gospel as restored [through the] Prophet, Joseph Smith ...  in order to be able
to preach the true gospel to my people and win for my Savior, hearts that should otherwise perish
in the darkness."</i> </p>
<p>Such letters received President McKay's attention and concern, not only because of their fervent plea
but also because of their letterhead, which read,   "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
Nigeria Branch."   The Prophet did not know that there were branches of the Church in Nigeria.</p>
<p>In 1961 President McKay assigned LaMar Williams, secretary to the Church Missionary Department,
to go to Nigeria on a month long fact finding mission, to determine if the people were sincere and
willing to accept the Church without holding the priesthood.  Although Brother Williams had been
responding to the flood of letters from Africa, he was not prepared for what he found there.  He was
met at the airport in Port Harcourt, Nigeria by ten pastors with whom he had been corresponding. 
He was treated like royalty but surprised to discover that not only did each pastor operate
independently, they were not even aware of each other.     The first official church meeting in black
Africa was held October 22, 1961 in a small mud hut in Opobo District, Nigeria where Brother
Williams met with a pastor and 110 followers.  No one came by car.  Many, including eight mothers
with small children, had begun their day before 4:00 a.m. and walked twenty-five miles or more to
be there.  After teaching them for two hours, Brother Williams prepared to end the meeting.  He
recorded: </p>
<p><i>It was hot as blazes.  My suit was wringing wet.  When I turned the meeting back to [the pastor],
I heard a murmur all through the congregation   and [the pastor] said to me,
"They don't want to go
home.  They have something to say."   Then for three hours  these people were standing up bearing
testimony to the truthfulness of the Church and how they believed in the Prophets.  I could not
believe what I was hearing.   One elderly gentleman said:   "I keep hearing you say, 'if we are
sincere.'   Elder Williams, I want you to know that I am sincere.  I am an old man .  I am sick.  But
when I heard you were going to be here, I walked 16 miles this morning to see you and to hear what
you have to say.  I still have to walk 16 miles to get back home, and I am not well.  I want you to
know that I am sincere or I would not be here.  I have not seen President McKay.  I have not seen
God.  But I have seen you.  And I will hold you personally accountable to tell President McKay that
I am sincere."</i> </p>
<p>Brother Williams reported to President McKay that he felt thousands were ready for baptism.  For
the next four years the Church made every effort to send missionaries but the Nigerian government
refused to issue the necessary visas.  When Africa's most devastating civil war, the Biafran war,
exploded in Nigeria these efforts ceased.  LaMar Williams turned over 15,000 names of unbaptized
African converts to Elders Spencer W.  Kimball and Gordon B.Hinckley, both of whom were on the
Church Missionary Committee.   The Church made every effort to establish itself in west Africa but
was prevented from doing so.  However, the Lord has promised that His eternal blessings will come
"in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will." </p>
<p>The Lord's "own time" for black Africa came in June1978.  "His own way" was a revelation given
to His Prophet, President Spencer W.  Kimball making all gospel blessings available to all worthy
members.  The Lord's "own will" regarding the priesthood restriction and the removal of it has been
stated by Prophets, Seers and Revelators.   </p>
<p>In 1949 the First Presidency stated that the priesthood restriction was "not a matter of the declaration
of a policy but of direct commandment from the Lord."   Twenty years later, they further stated:
"From the beginning of this dispensation, Joseph Smith and all succeeding presidents of the Church
have taught that [blacks] were not to receive the priesthood for reasons which we believe are known
to God, but which He has not made fully known to man."   President Spencer W.  Kimball, whose
clarion call during his ministry was to take the gospel to EVERY NATION, KINDRED, TONGUE
AND PEOPLE, was particularly aware of many under priesthood restriction throughout the world,
and he pleaded long and earnestly with the Lord in their behalf.  Also in numerous temple meetings,
President Kimball met with his Counselors and the Twelve to discuss this issue.</p>
<p>In such a meeting on June 2, 1978, President Kimball asked his Brethren to express their feelings
regarding this matter.  Elder David B.  Haight recalled that as each one spoke, there was an
outpouring of the Spirit which bonded their souls together in perfect unity.  Then President Kimball
suggested that they have prayer at the altar.  President Gordon B.  Hinckley recalled:&nbsp;
		</p>
<p><i>"There was
a hallowed and sanctified atmosphere in the room.  For me, it felt as if a conduit opened between the
heavenly throne and the kneeling, pleading prophet of God who was joined by his Brethren...  Every
man in that circle, by the power of the Holy Ghost, knew the same thing.  Not one of us was ever
quite the same after that.  Nor has the Church been quite the same.  Tremendous eternal
consequences for millions over the earth are flowing from that manifestation.  This has opened great
areas of the world to the teaching of the everlasting gospel.  We have cause to rejoice that we have
seen this glorious day."&nbsp;</i> </p>
<p>One tender moment of rejoicing was shared by David M.  Kennedy, who
had served for years as President Kimball's special ambassador in helping the Church enter new
countries.  Previous to the revelation, as they would study a large map of the world Brother Kennedy
would place one hand over the continent of Africa, saying,   "We can't go there unless they have the
priesthood." </p>
<p>On June 9, 1978, a subdued President Kimball returned from the temple prior to announcing to the
world the revelation that had been received.  He stopped at Brother Kennedy's office, opened the
door and with deep emotion, he said, "David, now you can take your hand off Africa." 
		</p>
<p>How important was this revelation?   The First Presidency have said that the most important events
in history are those which affect the largest numbers for the longest periods.  By this criteria, when
we consider those affected by this revelation which includes millions on the earth and billions on the
other side of the veil we can see why President Kimball said that it brought one of the greatest
changes and blessings that has ever been known.  Flood gates were now open for the gospel to go
to Africa and to African ancestors. When this revelation was announced, my wife and I were
presiding over the only mission on the continent of Africa.  The announcement brought feelings and
stirrings impossible to describe.  As inspiring as it was, I felt a great concern because Africans do
not traditionally keep written histories, and I felt their unique experiences needed to be preserved. 
The desire to help preserve that history was later realized.  Since coming to BYU, I have been blessed
by the Lord and received help from others in obtaining oral histories from more than 700 African
pioneers in twenty-six countries, from which I will now share some insights.</p>
<p>The Lord has historically raised up Elias' to prepare his people to receive the gospel.  John the
Baptist was the Elias who prepared people at the Savior's time.  At the beginning of this dispensation
the Lord used various Eliases.  For example, Sidney Rigdon, a Cambellite preacher in Ohio, prepared
many for the gospel, including future Counselors in the First Presidency, Apostles and Presiding
Bishops.  To Sidney Rigdon the Lord said: "thou was sent forth, even as John to prepare the way
before me...and thou knewest it not" (D&amp;C 35:4).</p>
<p>In black Africa, where the revelation on the Priesthood was, in effect, the restoration of the gospel
for them, a loving Heavenly Father raised up many Eliases to help prepare the people.  Let me share
some examples. </p>
<p>The first missionaries sent to black Africa were Rendell and Rachel Mabey and Ted and Janath
Cannon.  They arrived in Nigeria just five months after the revelation.  Their first baptism was
Anthony Obinna, who had waited and pleaded for membership for thirteen years.  In 1965 Brother
Obinna had a dream that he did not understand but which impressed him deeply.  He said: "One
night I was sleeping and a tall man came to me  and took me to one of the most beautiful buildings
and showed me all the rooms.  Then in 1970 I found [a] Reader's Digest article titled,   "The March
of the Mormons,"   with a picture of the Salt Lake Temple.  It was exactly the same building that I
had seen in my dreams."    Immediately Brother Obinna wrote to Church headquarters requesting
literature and baptism.  He received literature, organized a congregation and continued writing letters
requesting baptism.  Finally, after years of pleading, he wrote directly to the Council of Twelve
saying: "Your long silence about the establishment of the Church in Nigeria is very embarrassing. 
Did Christ not say,   'Go ye and teach all nations?"   It is not often that the Brethren are chastised by
nonmembers for not baptizing converts? However, when Brother Obinna learned that the revelation
had been received he wrote the following to President Kimball:   "We are happy for the many hours
in the Upper Room of the Temple you spent supplicating the Lord to bring us into the fold.  We
thank our Heavenly Father for hearing your prayers and ours and by revelation has confirmed the
long promised day to receive every blessing of the gospel."   On the day Brother Obinna was
baptized he was ordained to the Priesthood and set apart as the first black African branch president
and Sister Obinna became the first Relief Society president.  Soon after his baptism, Brother Obinna
prophesied: "The seed of the gospel will grow into a giant tree.  The Church in Nigeria will surprise
the world in its growth." </p>
<p>And so it has. </p>
<p>In both Nigeria and Ghana the missionaries found hundreds who had testimonies of the Book of
Mormon, the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the restoration of the Gospel.  All they needed was baptism. 
And so they were baptized!   In one twenty-four hour period 149 converts were baptized.  Within one
year there were over 1,700 members in 35 branches in West Africa.   After only nine and a half years
of missionary work, Elder Neal A. Maxwell organized the Aba Nigeria Stake on May 15, 1988 the
first stake in which all priesthood leaders were black and he noted that this was an historic day for
the Church   "in this dispensation, and in any dispensation."   He told the Saints: 
		</p>
<p><i>"I was present in the upper room of the temple that early June day in 1978 when all the General
Authorities gathered to receive the revelation and decision from President Spencer W.  Kimball.  I
wept with joy that day.  The handkerchief I wiped my tears with I took home and told my wife not
to wash it.  I put it in my book of remembrance, still bearing the marks of my tears.
On this
Sunday, I have a second handkerchief that [has] wiped more tears of joy.  I will take it home and
place it in my book of remembrance next to the other handkerchief."</i> </p>
<p>In Ghana the field was also ready to harvest, due mainly to another Elias, Joseph William Billy
Johnson, a preacher who obtained a Book of Mormon in 1964.  He said: </p>
<p>"As I read the Book of Mormon I became convinced that it was really the word of God, and
sometimes while reading I would burst into tears.  I felt the Spirit as I read.  I have a strong testimony
[of] the Book of Mormon.  It is a very powerful book!"   Brother Johnson also knew that the Lord
called him to be an Elias.  He said:&nbsp; </p>
<p><i>"One early morning I saw the heavens open and angels with
trumpets singing songs of praise unto God.  In the course of this I heard my name mentioned thrice,
'Johnson, Johnson, Johnson.  If you will take up my work as I will command you, I will bless you
and bless your land.'   Trembling and in tears I replied, 'Lord, with thy help I will do whatsoever
you will command me.' From that day onward, I was constrained by that Spirit to go from street to
street to deliver the message which we had read from the Book of Mormon.  I did exactly as the Lord
commanded me and immediately our persecution started."</i> </p>
<p>Brother Johnson reported that he was strengthened and taught by dreams and visions, including
instructions from the Prophet Joseph Smith and President Brigham Young.  He later demonstrated
his gratitude when his son was born, who today may be the only young man in Ghana named
Brigham.    On another occasion, when he was very discouraged his deceased brother appeared to
him in a dream, and said: "Don't worry, you have chosen the only true church on earth and I am now
investigating your church."   I was surprised.  I never knew that the church extended to another
world.  It was my brother who brought that knowledge to me.  He said that if I didn't believe him,
he would sing a song from my church, and he sang Come, Come Ye Saints.  That was the first time
I had heard that hymn.  He said, "Don't leave the church my brother. Please see that I am baptized." 
 Brother Johnson then noted:   "It was my brother who enlightened me about baptism for the dead
and brought it to my knowledge.  Most of my relatives appeared to me in dreams [saying] "Reverend
Johnson, do you know you have a work to do for us? Our great grandsons and daughters will be in
your church soon.  See that we are baptized."   </p>
<p>"I learned these doctrines before the missionaries arrived.  Nothing they taught us seemed strange. 
They simply confirmed what we had heard."   For fourteen long years Brother Johnson helped
organize ten congregations with over a thousand followers.  He noted that in his dreams the Lord
referred to his followers as Latter-day Saints, even though they were not yet members.  Brother
Johnson identified the name of the church by placing prominent signs in front of the buildings they
used for worship.  </p>
<p>Two years ago while filming Brother Johnson's story in Ghana, I walked with him through a
dilapidated building that he had used twenty-five years earlier as a church meeting house.  I noticed
that the roof was patched with boards to keep out the rain, but my attention was drawn to one
particularly colorful board.  As I pointed it out to Brother Johnson, he gasped in surprise.  It was part
of the sign that stood in front of the building identifying the name of the church.  It will be given to
the Church History Museum as a treasured artifact from the pioneer period of Ghana.</p>
<p>One night at midnight, after many lonely years of struggle, Brother Johnson heard a short-wave news
broadcast from England that announced that blacks could now receive the priesthood.  He burst into
tears of joy, knowing that the Church would now come to Africa.   Following his baptism Brother
Johnson served as Ghana's first branch president and later served several missions.  Twelve years
after his baptism he was ordained a patriarch.</p>
<p>Another great Elias is Moses Mahlangu, a preacher from Soweto, South Africa  who found a copy
of the Book of Mormon.  Because the bottom of the title page was torn off he did not know what
church had published it.</p>
<p>As he read the book, he was filled with light and understanding.  He said:   "I had desires to find God
and to receive revelation, but I was never satisfied until I got the Book of Mormon."   Fluent in nine
languages, Moses taught from the Book of Mormon and had gathered many followers before he
learned the name of the Church and made contact with the mission headquarters in Johannesburg. 
For over fourteen years he waited, preparing himself and others for baptism.  During this time he
frequently visited the mission president and obtained copies of the Book of Mormon and other
literature, and I was therefore privileged to know him.   Soon after the revelation was announced, I
sought out Moses.  As we embraced I asked him if he had heard about the revelation.  He said,  
"Yes.  Does this mean that I can now be baptized?" I asked,   "Moses, would you like to be
baptized?"    His eyes welled with tears as he said softly,   "I have waited for fourteen years."  
		</p>
<p>I conducted a baptismal interview that I shall never forget.  To every question, I received the same
answer:   "I have been keeping that commandment for fourteen years." </p>
<p>I was deeply humbled in the presence of this great pioneer.  His son, who as a boy accompanied
Moses in his ministry, later served as Moses' Bishop in the Soweto ward, near Johannesburg.   
		</p>
<p>In more recent years the Church has been established in Kenya.  Julius Kasue became one of the
early converts after receiving a copy of the Book of Mormon from a Latter-day Saint expatriate.  In
a few days, after having read half of the book, Julius returned to his friend with a full page of
questions.  His first question was:   "How did Alma get his authority to baptize at the Waters of
Mormon?" </p>
<p>Soon after Julius was baptized he returned to his isolated village of Chyulu, where he shared the
gospel with others.  He built a small meeting place out of palm branches and organized a group who
worshiped together.  At his request missionaries came to teach eight individuals but 75 showed up
for the discussions.  Forty people were baptized and a branch was organized with Brother Kasue
sustained as branch president.  Soon he informed the mission president that others were ready for
baptism, including two men who rode their bicycles two hours to attend church each week. 
Concerned that the branch was too isolated, approval was given for only the two men and their
families to be baptized.  To provide for the baptism a corrugated steel tank was hauled by truck from
Nairobi to Chyulu, an arduous journey that took four hours.  Because of a severe drought, most of
a day was spent pumping and hauling water four miles over a rocky trail.  To raise the water level
further ten brethren knelt around the inside edge of the tank so each candidate could be immersed. 
When 40 jubilant converts showed up for baptism the mission president learned that nearly every
one in a village is considered family.  The Chyulu branch was soon divided, a district was organized
and a chapel was built.  Last year, although the Chyulu district made up only 15% of the Church
membership in Kenya, they provided half the Kenyan missionaries. In 1979, just after the
missionaries arrived in black Africa,   Presiding Bishop Victor L. Brown prophetically told Elder
Mabey:   "I think you are on the frontier of one of the greatest historical events in Church history as
far as growth is concerned."   During the first 125 years of the Church in Africa, membership never
reached 8,000.  During the first 22 years after the revelation it exploded to150,000.  During the year
2000, sacrament meeting attendance in the West Africa Area was 54%, second only to the Utah
South Area.  This is especially impressive when we consider that most Africans have to walk a
considerable distance to their meetings.  Africa Area President, Elder James A.  Mason, tells of a
stake conference in West Africa which was attended by 110% of the stake membership and there
were only 8 cars in the parking lot.  Another factor that brings strength to the Church in Africa is
strong priesthood leadership.  Africa is the only area of the Church where there are more male
members that sisters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>May I share one example of priesthood strength in Africa? About two years
ago I hosted a former minister of Finance from Ghana who visited Utah.  He had served for eight
years and is recognized world wide for lifting the economy of this poor African nation.  While
meeting with a member of the Twelve he shared a remarkable discovery he made during this visit. 
He said that when he became the Minister of Finance he was convinced that in order to improve
Ghana's economy, corruption must be eliminated within the government.  He began quietly
observing and testing government employees to see who would not take a bribe or be dishonest.  He
found only two that he could fully trust and he elevated them to key government positions.  Then he
said,   "I did not know until coming to Utah on this trip that those two men are members of your
church."   One of these two brethren is now serving in the Africa West Area Presidency and the other
is in the Accra Ghana stake presidency.  </p>
<p>President Gordon B.  Hinckley has said that the strength of the Church is not in our numbers, our
buildings, nor in the amount of tithes and offerings, but our strength is in the testimony that burns
in the heart of each member.   It has been my privilege to hear hundreds of testimonies from African
converts.  I conclude with one.  It was spoken by a nine year old boy in a fast and testimony meeting
in Aba, Nigeria two weeks after he was baptized.  This was his message:    "Good morning Brothers
and Sisters.  I am happy to bear my testimony because I was baptized on conference day.  Since I
joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, God has been guiding me both in the school
and at home.  Now that I am baptized, I promise to continue obeying God's commandments.  I testify
that The Church of Jesus Christ is true.  I testify that the Prophet Ezra Taft Benson is true.  I know
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  I say all these things in Jesus' name.  Amen."
		</p>
<p>When Brother Jude Inmpey, an early pioneer from Nigeria, was called on to share his feeling about
the gospel coming to black Africa, he related a dream he had not understood until that very moment. 
He dreamed that he was the only black person in a large gathering of white members and an organ
was playing background music.  It sounded terrible and people were complaining.  Then someone
discovered that the organist was playing only on the white keys.  Brother Inmpey observed:   "For
many, many years the Church has been playing only on the white keys, but now we are playing on
the white and the black keys, and the music is much, much sweeter." </p>
<p>President Hinckley witnessed the sweetness of this music in 1998 when he became the first President
of the Church to visit black Africa.  A member of the Twelve observed that not only did the Prophet
have a great impact on the Saints in Africa, but the Saints in Africa also had a great impact on the
Prophet.   </p>
<p>During a conference in Ghana President Hinckley announced that a temple would be built in their
land.  This prompted immediate and spontaneous applause.  Although this was an unusual response
for such a solemn setting, it was their natural reaction in expressing their indescribable joy and
immense gratitude.  For many years hundreds of African Saints have carried current temple
recommends, yet 99.5% of the members in West Africa have never been to the temple. While in
Africa, President Hinckley compared Peter's revelation, that opened the door for the gospel to go
to the Gentiles nearly 2000 years ago, to the revelation on the priesthood allowing the gospel to go
to black Africa.  He quoted Peter's statement to Cornelius:   "God is no respecter of persons.  But
in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him." Then the
Prophet said:   "That, my beloved brothers and sisters describes you.  I've had that testimony
reconfirmed in my heart on this trip as I have met with you and many others, that all are alike unto
God.  We are all of a great family, a marvelous family of the living Christ, worshiping Him
together."   Then referring to the revelation of June 1978, President Hinckley said:   "I want to give
testimony here that that was inspired, that that was a revelation from God.  I was there.  I was an
eyewitness to it in the House of the Lord.  How grateful we are." </p>
<p>I also testify that this work is divine and so are our spiritual roots.  We are truly brothers and sisters
through our spirit's birth and through our spiritual rebirth.  May we always radiate pure love towards
others regardless of race or culture as our Heavenly Father and the Savior do.  Indeed, as the Prophet
Nephi and President Hinckley have testified:   "ALL ARE ALIKE UNTO GOD,"   to which I testify.

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px"><font size="2">April 10, 2001</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">You are a pretty dramatic sight!   Here you are, young men and women sharing in the
spirit of God - in the middle of the week, the middle of the day demonstrating how you
contribute consistently to our Father's kingdom.  You share in a singular college experience here
at BYU-Idaho.  When I attended the University of Utah there was only a small Institute to fulfill
that role.</p>
<p>	I am honored to be with you because I feel your goodness.  You are preparing in the right
way to lead families, congregations and nations in these difficult last days.  You are the leaders
who will see through the mists of darkness and who will stand firm while so many tumble and
turn with the latest method or jargon or round of applause.  You have heard from your youth,
from prophets of God , that you have been saved to come forth at this period of time.  Let it
remind you of your nobility and your shared purpose to Come Unto Christ. </p>
<p>	We stand alone in this effort.  Our society has become obsessed with the satisfaction and
gratification of self.  Selfless living that has the capacity to unite us has been overpowered by 
self-expression, self-development, and self gratification.   Self-centered living is the becoming
the norm.  Standards have been relaxed or have simply been dropped to allow every one to do
their own thing,  whenever and with whomever they please. This self-driven society dominates so
much of what we see and do.  It so clearly repeats the pattern from the Book of Mormon where
self indulgence destroyed nations and peoples, over and over again.</p>
<p>	What a welcome relief it is when I see the unity of this student body.  I think of the
scripture: "That we may be one".<a href="#N_1_"><sup> (1)</sup></a>  And that we may "stand fast in one spirit, with one mind
striving together for the faith of the gospel.<a href="#N_2_"><sup> (2)</sup></a>"  For "ye are all one in Christ Jesus."<a href="#N_3_"><sup> 
(3)</sup></a> </p>
<p>	This powerful focus reminds me of one of my favorite images:  <strong>Canada Geese</strong>.    As you
may know, I was raised in Cardston, Canada (a small town just across the U.S.
border) and I have
just returned from living there for three years while my husband was president of the temple. 
The community is nestled at the edge of the wind-swept prairie and with the exception of our
grand Cardston, Alberta Temple, (the only true temple!),  the environment is distinctly rural and 
agrarian. </p>
<p>	I am certain it was my early years of playing in the fields and hills around my home  that
shaped my love for nature, the mountains, pine trees, wild flowers, and contributed to my joy in
simply being outside looking up at the sky.  Each spring I would see the Canada Geese in their
distinctive "V shaped" flight migrating home for the summer.  In the fall, the familiar honking as
they returned south signaled the change of seasons.  Each fall, I still find myself checking the sky
-- hoping to see the swoop and flow of Canada Geese.  As a little girl I was attracted to the
pictures their formations made in the sky.  As an adult, I am intrigued by their patterns,  for they
fly together, in flocks.  We could go so far as to say they "fly as one." </p>
<p>	We can learn some important truths from the Canada geese  that you can apply to drawing
your college community together, "That you may be one."</p>
<p> <strong>The truths begin with this first concept: Geese do not fly alone.</strong> </p>
<p>	They fly in flocks, synchronized together, one at the lead and the others in their
relative positions.  As each goose flaps its wings, it creates an "uplift" for the bird
following.  By flying in a "V" formation, the whole flock adds as much as 70
percent more flying range than if each bird flew alone. </p>
<p>	Here's the lesson. Those who share a common direction and means of achieving
community can get where they are going quicker and easier because they are traveling on the
thrust of another.</p>
<p> <strong><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Second:   </span>Geese are resilient, hearty, determined and tireless</strong>. They
instinctively seek to develop the character traits that contribute to  the experience
of each participant.</p>
<p>What's the lesson?  Bring out the best in each other.  Build each other up.  Prize what each one
brings to the association.  Accept every one no matter their circumstance.  I teach the fourteen
year-olds in Sunday School right now.  Teenagers are dismayed as they watch high schools under
siege of gun-wielding young people.  They see others handcuffed and taken to jail for shooting or
another form of violence.  When we ask, "Why did this happen", we often learn that the gunman
was taunted, ridiculed by peers.  And finally they snapped.  It is no excuse,  but it is reality that
put-downs, abuse of another, cruelty and mocking may have tragic results.  Whether you are
fourteen, nineteen, or seventy you can learn from the Canada geese.</p>
<p> <strong><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Third:</span>  Geese attach to each other</strong>, just as we do, living in a form of family life. 
Young adult geese select mates and stay with that partner for life.  They are loyal
and committed.</p>
<p>	The lesson:   Know the worth of  building relationships.  They last,   and you learn from
them.   When you find a companion,  form a union that is impenetrable.  </p>
<p> <strong><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Fourth:</span></strong> <strong>Geese</strong> <strong>have an uncanny sense of direction. </strong>They  know where they are and
where they are going at any moment in their   flight.   They   can fly more than 1,000 miles
without stopping to rest.</p>
<p>	The lesson here is that they have shared purpose and a common goal.</p>
<p> <strong><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Fifth:  </span>Geese trust each other. </strong></p>
<p>	When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into formation and another--who has been
trained and knows the way - flies to the point position.</p>
<p>	I like the lesson here.  Geese take turns.  Their leadership and feeling of belonging is not a
matter of where they serve, but how.             </p>
<p>	Now, one of the geese is probably in charge of the flight plan and another maybe has
responsibility for meals, but they know their destination and the means of reaching it.  For each
one, the thrust is the same: work together, share in the process, stretch to reach the appointed
destination.  Don't fly off to the side.  Don't buzz out in front.  Keep up.  Stay together.  Fly as
one.</p>
<p>	How can you apply these lessons?    How can students at Ricks be united and encourage
more students to promote its righteous purposes?	</p>
<p>	I'll give you some suggestions.</p>
<p> <strong>Serve with one heart and one mind.</strong></p>
<p>	Every one of you is important, every effort is valuable:   your determination, resilience
and loyalty critical. Remember, Canada Geese fly in formation, united actually  in heart and mind, one out in front, leading the way, and all the others contributing to a  dramatic geometric
pattern  in the sky.</p>
<p>	Relate this to the inspiring account of the city of Enoch, a people so united that they were
"taken up into heaven."<a href="#N_4_"><sup> (4)</sup></a>    The  Lord describes  them as  Zion, "because they were of one heart
and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness and there was no poor among them."<a href="#N_5_"><sup> (5)</sup></a>  One heart and
one mind is the key.  They lived the gospel so well and so fully that they felt the spirit in their
hearts  and understood in their minds the significance of a what they knew to be true.  </p>
<p>	In Moses we read that Enoch heard the Lord's voice telling him to prophesy unto the
people and call them to repentance "for their hearts have waxed hard, and their ears are dull of
hearing, and their eyes cannot see afar off."  Hearts are  critical to our journey, especially open
hearts.</p>
<p>	All of us probably know someone who has drifted into spiritual bitterness: maybe some
of you have been there yourself.</p>
<p>	Enoch began his ministry with a people whose hearts were hardened. . Imagine his
surprise when he  heard the Lord's call to prophesy to the people.  Enoch said:  "Why is it that I
have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of
speech."</p>
<p>	Enoch was not exactly the big man on campus. Enoch, like most of us,  struggled with his
limitations.  He struggled with acceptance among his peers.  He was not the obvious choice .  But
the Lord called  him to "fly out in front" and lead the people.  Why?  Because the Lord knew his
heart.  And He made dramatic promises to Enoch.  "Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all
thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and the rivers shall turn from
their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; therefore, walk with me."<a href="#N_6_"><sup> (6)</sup></a>  Enoch was not
alone in his assignment.  </p>
<p>	And we know that when Enoch began to preach, he drew people to him.   And "All his
people walked with God."<a href="#N_7_"><sup> (7)</sup></a> </p>
<p>	There is no greater example of a community of saints, a united people.   Like the Canada
Geese, they had to draw strength for the journey from each other. They had to become loyal,
hearty, resilient and faithful,   leaving no one behind.</p>
<p><strong>	Recognize your responsibility for others.</strong></p>
<p>	Let's look to the analogy of the geese again.  When one gets sick, wounded or shot down,
two drop out of formation and follow their fellow member down to the ground to help and
provide protection.  They stay with this member of the flock until he or she either is able to fly
again or dies.</p>
<p>	Compassion, generosity, patience, kindness - these are the selfless qualities that make a
difference.  But they are not the qualities that reach the headlines or the 10 o'clock news.</p>
<p>	  And they are a far cry from the wail of Marley, Charles Dickens character in <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">A
Christmas Carol</span> who had been so successful in his business.  Before his death,   Marley enjoyed
money and clients, but he had no heart.   It had been cankered over the years by his myopic view
of success; he loved money; he had no love for people.  While we usually recount this story in
December, its message is universal and timeless. One Christmas eve, Marley came back as a
ghost to visit his friend and partner Ebenezer Scrooge and denounce his life as a failure.  Scrooge
was stunned.</p>
<p> <em>"You were always a good man of business, Jacob," faltered Scrooge, . . .</em></p>
<p><em>	"Business!" cried the ghost, wringing its hands. . ."Mankind was my business. 
The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and
benevolence ,were all my business.  The dealings of my trade were but a drop of
water in the comprehensive ocean of my business." </em></p>
<p>	His expression --Mankind was my business--  has become legend.  It is based in the
truth,.  "the worth of souls is great in the eyes of God."<a href="#N_8_"><sup> (8)</sup></a> </p>
<p>	Listen to the passage from Scrooge:</p>
<p> <em>"You are fettered, Tell me why?"</em></p>
<p><em>		"I wear the chain I forged in life," replied the Ghost.  "I made it link by
link and yard by yard; it is a ponderous chain."</em></p>
<p><em>		"Speak comfort to me, Jacob!"</em></p>
<p><em>		"I have none to give,"  the Ghost replied. . ."I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I
cannot linger anywhere.  Weary journeys lie before me!"</em></p>
<p><em>		"Seven years dead," mused Scrooge.  "And traveling all the time."</em></p>
<p><em>		"The whole time," said the Ghost.  "No rest, no peace."</em></p>
<p><em>		"You travel fast?" said Scrooge.</em></p>
<p><em>		"On the wings of the wind," replied the Ghost.</em></p>
<p><em>		Scrooge ran to the window and looked out.  The air was filled with
phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they
went.  Every one of them wore chains; none were free.</em> </p>
<p>	What are those chains?  Regret, remorse, a haunting face, the phrase "if only", the busy-ness of life and all we have to do that keep us from serving one another.  And what awaits those
who travel fast but not with others?  "Wandering hither and thither in restless haste"</p>
<p>	Whether we are in college full time, or have part time employment or living in my
neighborhood, we have so many opportunities to lift others.    Do we see them, do we feel for
them?    Do we smile at them and at those we meet who need encouragement?   Do we drop
down, as do the geese, and stand vigil with those who need us, right now?  Do we begrudge the
interruption to our own cadence of daily living.  How about the little gestures of concern?</p>
<p>	Have you ever walked into Church and searched for a seat because the empty ones were
all being saved "for someone." I have.    I remember attending a missionary homecoming of a
friend; I got there early, but all seats in chapel had coats or purses on them and  were "being
saved"    I'm a pretty put together person but I was almost in tears.  Being on the outside doesn't
feel very good, does it.  We've all been there. Do we find places on committees and give
assignments to our friends first, leaving others on the edge with no opportunity to be one of us? 
Do we work at putting names with faces?</p>
<p> <strong>Know that the flight may be bumpy.		</strong></p>
<p>	Brothers and sisters, people matter.</p>
<p>	To the Lord, there is no distinction between school,  church and home.  They are all three
forums to exercise compassion, kindness, generosity, patience, understanding.   In Relief Society
we emphasize, "Charity Never Faileth." Charity is not the exclusive province of  the poor, unless
we are talking "the poor in heart. . . . the poor in spirit" and then charity is right at home.  Charity
unites us at our most vulnerable moments, because charity is the pure love of Christ. </p>
<p>	I have always been fond of a story from the era of the Great Depression.  The Mayor of
New York City, Fiorella LaGuardia was an unusual leader.  New York named an airport after
him and perhaps that has something to do with how he cared for his people.  While in office he
sometimes    presided at the Police Court just to keep in touch with what was happening in the
streets.  One bitter cold day the officers brought in a trembling, ragged man charged with stealing
a load of bread.  He defended his actions by explaining that his family was starving.</p>
<p>	"I've got to punish you," declared LaGuardia.  "The law makes no exception."    So  he
fined the man ten dollars.  But, as he said that, the Mayor reached into his pocket and brought out
a $10 dollar bill which he tossed into his hat.  "The fine is paid," he said.  "And I'm going to fine
everybody in this courtroom fifty cents for living in a town where a man has to steal bread in
order to eat.  The Bailiff passed the hat and the incredulous man, with a light of heaven in his
eye, left the courtroom with forty-seven dollars and fifty cents.</p>
<p>	In the New Testament we read of the Lord's interaction with those who appeared to be
unworthy or not to care about  his message:   the woman taken in adultery, the rich young man
who went away sorrowful.        "But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with
compassion on them, because they fainted and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no
shepherd."<a href="#N_9_"><sup> (9)</sup></a>   The Lord said, "He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
receiveth him that sent me."<a href="#N_10_"><sup> (10)</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>	Brothers and Sisters,  Be strong.</strong></p>
<p>	One of the truths of this life is that phrase we hate to hear: "There must needs be
opposition in all things."   That means sometimes things will be hard.</p>
<p>	In a driving rain or a hailstorm, geese lay their feathers flat and stretch their heads high,
reducing to a minimum the body surface exposed to the assault.  They know how to handle what
comes at them and so do you.  But they aren't just in the tuck position, they are preparing for
further flight.</p>
<p>	Just as Joshua prepared to meet the inhabitants of the promised land. The Lord told
Joshua, "Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed."  </p>
<p>	What do I mean, be strong?</p>
<p>	Accept disappointment.  Forgive others and forgive yourself.  Don't take offense, don't
be sharp or callous. This character trait is the single most mature and endearing quality you can
develop.</p>
<p>	Shine the spotlight on others.  Be excited when they do well; rescue them when they
flounder.  A friend of mine, Shirley Thomas, is just this kind of person.  She's a former counselor
in the General Relief Society Presidency.  Everyone wants to be her friend because she makes so
much of what they do and what they are.  She will go to any length to see another person
succeed, all the time never calling attention to herself. </p>
<p>	I spoke with a young man recently who was a freshman at a large university, (actually it
was BYU-Provo.)     Having come from a very small high school of less than 200, he was
overwhelmed by the number of students.    Everywhere he looked there were people, faces with
no names.  He was one of them.  One Saturday night, however, he got up the courage to go to a
dance.  He was separated from his roommate and the others he had gotten to know and for 45
minutes he walked around by himself. No one stopped, no one looked, no one noticed this young
man.  I think there were probably hundreds, maybe thousands there that night facing the same
plight.  Desperately alone, he closed his eyes and prayed to one he knew was there, his Father in
Heaven.  He prayed for help. . " Help me not be alone."     And then he turned to walk back
toward the celebration.  But he felt prompted to take another sidewalk.  The Lord was at work
prompting others onto that same sidewalk and sure enough, the young man ran into a group of
students and one called out his name, someone  from his home ward who had moved several
years before.  Someone who knew his name, drew him in.  That's what we must do for one
another.</p>
<p>	  Learn names, call people by their names.  The Lord knows not only our names, he
knows our hearts.</p>
<p>	When it seems a challenge to be strong in living the principles you know are true,
remember this mental picture, described by a Christian priest:</p>
<p> <em>"When I am tempted to listen to hot, egotistic voices within my own heart; when it
seems that love can never win but always lose; when it seems as though humility
is ruthlessly trodden down by those who pass over it on their way to their own
selfish ambitions; when it seems as though God cannot possibly triumph; when
pity and love and mercy and kindness and tenderness are weakness; when it
seems as though greatness is only possessed by those who know how to grab, and
have the power to snatch at it, no matter what the cost to others -- ah, yes, when
the voices sound in my own heart which say you must play for your own hand, you
must think of number one, you must not let yourself be trodden down -- when I
am thus tempted, may I hear in imagination the tinkling of water, poured into a
basin, and see, as in a vision, the Son of God washing the disciples feet."<a href="#N_11_"><sup> (11)</sup></a></em> </p>
<p><strong>	Now, I want you to trust those you lead and those you follow.</strong> </p>
<p>	Geese in formation honk from behind to encourage those in the front to keep up their
speed.  It is as if they are saying, "We  are with you. Fly on."</p>
<p>	When we speak of being one, we are suggesting that all of us reach beyond the borders of
our own lives.  It only makes sense that our reach extends beyond the borders of the Ricks
campus and to the leadership of the Church in general.  Last week we again raised our hands to
sustain the brethren of this church.  By so doing we are placing our trust in them.  But it doesn't
stop there.  We must fly in formation with them.  Those that pull off to the side, that honk not to
encourage but to reroute, perhaps to blare disagreement, violate the trust that has been.</p>
<p><strong>	And finally, I would say know where you are going.</strong> </p>
<p>	It is a magnificent experience to see geese arrive in the sky  begin to circle and then land. 
Shortly before touching down on the ground,  they thrust their feet forward and brake themselves
with powerful wing beats.  They are in control of their direction and in line with their purpose.
They know the way back home.</p>
<p>	These geese have a flight plan.  It includes their route, their stops, their landing field. 
We, too, filed such a plan when we joined with Jesus Christ in the preexistence.  We chose our
direction and with it came definite and glorious responsibility.  We recognized then the power of
the Lord's plan to get us all the way home.</p>
<p>	Jesus Christ in the last hours of his life laid down a template for us to follow.   During his
great intercessory prayer in Gethsemane, he prayed that his disciples would be one.<a href="#N_12_"><sup> (12)</sup></a>   Imagine
him walking out of the Garden of Gethsemane, his disciples clustered, the soldiers jeering and
mocking.      Jesus Christ knew this was the path -- home. "If he be the king of Israel, let him
now come down from the cross, and we will believe him"<a href="#N_13_"><sup> (13)</sup></a> his tormentors scoffed.  They asked
for signs to satisfy their narrow understanding of here and now.  He gave them no answer.   There
was no drum roll for the world to hear, no cellular phone was on hand for him to call ahead and
set up a triumphant arrival.  He went quietly, humbly, carrying a burden that we can not even
imagine.  He had the responsibility to lead all mankind home to their Father in Heaven.  This
hour was not his alone, it was the turning point for us all.  It was then that all of us were gathered
into the fold of the good shepherd.  One fold, one shepherd. </p>
<p>	Today, by the power of the priesthood we, men and women,  receive leadership directly
from him.   I pray that you will understand  the significance of that power and with faith, humility
and hope, draw upon it as we fly on, with unity of purpose. </p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>Thank you for that gracious introduction. I am happy to be here with
      you today.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a student in college. Like some of you, I had
      trouble deciding what my major should be. First I thought about majoring
      in economics. That way, if I couldn't get a job after I graduated, at
      least I would understand why.</p>
<p>Then I thought I might major in physical education. I went down to the
      gym to lift weights, but the laughter made it difficult to concentrate.</p>
<p>I sampled some classes, but I didn't always do very well. Once I took a
      geography test that asked, "What is the capital of Wyoming?" I
      wrote, "The capital of Wyoming is W."</p>
<p>I also took a photography class. I just about went crazy trying to take
      a close-up of the horizon. The teacher in that class gave me an F-minus.
      He said that giving me an F would be unfair to the people who failed
      normally.</p>
<p>I studied chemistry, but I thought that there were only four elements
      on the periodic table: earth, air, fire, and water. I thought that fire
      has three electrons in the outer shell.</p>
<p>I thought about studying a foreign language. Then I thought, if we were
      intended to learn a foreign language, then how come the Bible was written
      in English?</p>
<p>Finally I majored in political science and then went to law school. I
      love lawyer jokes. For example, people say that's how copper wire was
      invented: two lawyers fighting over a penny.</p>
<p>A recent study reported that if the number of lawyers in the United
      States continues to grow at the present rate, by the year 2020 there will
      be more lawyers than people.</p>
<p>It's true that some lawyers are dishonest, arrogant, greedy, venal,
      amoral, ruthless buckets of toxic slime. On the other hand, I think it's
      unfair to judge the entire profession by five or six hundred thousand bad
      apples.</p>
<p>Leonard Arrington's book, <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Great
      Basin Kingdom</span>,<a href="#N_2_"><sup> (2)</sup></a> tells a story
      about Orderville, Utah, where in the 1870s the Saints lived the law of
      consecration. It was not easy to live in Orderville. The town was founded
      in an atmosphere of poverty. By contrast, not far away, at Silver Reef,
      the coming of the railroad permitted the development of the silver mines.
      People in surrounding towns suddenly were able to buy imported clothing
      and other commodities. The Orderville Saints came to be viewed as
      "old fashioned." Their floppy straw hats and gray jeans became
      objects of ridicule. Orderville teenagers began to envy their peers in
      neighboring towns.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">One of those teenagers was
      the father of my wife's great aunt. He was growing quickly, as teenagers
      do, and his pants became too short. But there were no holes in them, and
      so his application for a new pair was denied. However, there was a large
      crop of lambs that spring. When the lambs' tails were docked, he sheared
      the wool off the tails. When he took a load of wool to Nephi, he quietly
      traded the lamb's tail wool for a brand new pair of store-bought gentile
      pants. When he returned, he wore the new pants to the next dance.
      "His entrance caused a sensation."<a href="#N_3_"><sup> (3)</sup></a>
      According to the story, one young woman rushed up to him and kissed him.
      The president of the Order asked for an explanation, and the young man
      told the truth. The president said, "According to your own story
      these pants belong to the Order. You are requested to appear before the
      Board of Management tomorrow evening at half-past eight, and to bring the
      store pants with you."<a href="#N_4_"><sup> (4)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">At the meeting, the Board
      commended the young man for his enterprise, but reminded him that all
      pants must be made from the same cloth. But to prove its good will, the
      Board agreed to unseam the store pants and use them as a pattern for all
      pants made in the future. They told the young man that he would receive
      the first pair.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The tailoring department was
      soon overwhelmed with orders for the new pants. It was noticed that the
      boys' old pants were getting thin, and even holes developed, on the seat
      of the pants. This was a puzzle. The boys were frequently on their knees
      when praying or weeding the garden, but they didn't spend much time
      sitting down. Why were these holes developing? Then the elders saw groups
      of boys going to the shed where the grindstone was located. They
      investigated. The boys were wearing out the seat of their pants on the
      grindstone. The elders protested and then gave in. They sent a load of
      wool to Washington Mills to trade for cloth, and the tailor shop became a
      busy place. Thus ended the great pants rebellion of Orderville.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">A quick look at our clothes
      here today reveals that we don't live in Orderville. However, we are
      expected to consecrate our time, abilities, and material possessions to
      build up the Kingdom of God. We are expected to be fully committed to the
      gospel of Jesus Christ. We recognize that none of us is perfect, and that
      all of us "come short of the glory of God." Rom. 3:23. However,
      we should strive to do our best. How can we do that? I would like to
      discuss four principles that help us to be more fully committed to the
      gospel. They are: faith, courage, putting the gospel first, and having an
      eternal perspective.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><b>FAITH</b></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The first principle of
      commitment is faith. The <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Lectures
      on Faith</span> teach that faith is "the first principle in revealed
      religion, and the foundation of all righteousness."<a href="#N_5_"><sup>
      (5)</sup></a> They explain, "Faith . . . is the first great governing
      principle which has power, dominion, and authority over all things; by it
      they exist, by it they are upheld, by it they are changed, or by it they
      remain, agreeable to the will of God."<a href="#N_6_"><sup> (6)</sup></a>
      Joseph Smith said, "By faith the worlds were made."<a href="#N_7_"><sup>
      (7)</sup></a> Jesus said, "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard
      seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and
      it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you." Matt.
      17:20.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Sometimes we feel
      overwhelmed, or that the tasks before us are impossible. It is helpful at
      those times to remember the story of Peter walking on the water. It is
      found in Matthew 14:25-32:</span>
</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And in the fourth watch of
      the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And when the disciples saw
      him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and
      they cried out for fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">But straightway Jesus spake
      unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And Peter answered him and
      said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And he said, Come. And when
      Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to
      Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">But when he saw the wind
      boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord,
      save me.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And immediately Jesus
      stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said, O thou of little
      faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And when they were come into
      the ship, the wind ceased.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Sometimes we feel the wind
      boisterous, and we are afraid, and we feel that we are sinking. Like
      Peter, we cry unto the Lord, and Jesus stretches forth his hand, and
      catches us, and the wind ceases. And then we feel like the disciples in
      the ship (verse 33): "Then they that were in the ship came and
      worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God." Matt.
      14:33.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We need to exercise our
      faith. Just as the Lord was there for Peter, he is there for us, too. If
      we trust in him, we can, figuratively speaking, walk on the water. We
      cannot do it by ourselves. We must have faith in him to overcome our fears
      and feelings of inadequacy. But with his help, we can work miracles.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In D&amp;C 88:64, the Lord
      said, "Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name it shall be given unto
      you, that is expedient for you; . . . ." Of course, we do not receive
      everything that we ask for. Before we can receive something, it must also
      be the Lord's will. The Apostle Paul prayed three times that the thorn in
      his flesh would be removed. 2 Cor. 12:7-8. The Lord answered Paul's prayer
      but did not grant the request. The Lord said, "My grace is sufficient
      for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. . . ." 2 Cor.
      12:9. The thorn in Paul's flesh was actually a blessing. Paul wrote that
      it kept him humble, from being "exalted above measure." 2 Cor.
      12:7. Although the Lord declined to grant Paul's request, the Lord blessed
      him greatly. He made Paul into a great missionary and preserved his life
      until his work was complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">President Spencer W. Kimball
      taught,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">[J]ust as undaunted faith
      has stopped the mouths of lions, made ineffective fiery flames, opened dry
      corridors through rivers and seas, protected against deluge and drouth,
      and brought heavenly manifestations at the instance of prophets, so in
      each of our lives faith can heal the sick, bring comfort to those who
      mourn, strengthen resolve against temptation, relieve from the bondage of
      harmful habits, lend the strength to repent and change our lives, and lead
      to a sure knowledge of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Indomitable faith can
      help us live the commandments with a willing heart and thereby bring
      blessings unnumbered, with peace, perfection, and exaltation in the
      kingdom of God.<a href="#N_8_"><sup> (8)</sup></a></span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><b>COURAGE</b></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The second principle of
      commitment is courage. For most of us, it is hard to have courage. We fear
      that things will go wrong, and we worry. In the movie <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">The
      Music Man</span>, Professor Harold Hill said, "A coward dies a
      thousand deaths; a brave man, only five hundred."</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Elder Sterling W. Sill told
      a story that demonstrated courage. "During the first world war, the
      captain of a gunboat gave the order for his ship to go to the rescue of a
      stricken comrade. The mate pointed out the hazards to the captain. Their
      return would surely be cut off, leaving little chance for them to get back
      to port. The captain replied, `We have to go out; we don't have to come
      back.'"<a href="#N_9_"><sup> (9)</sup></a> Similarly, Nephi said,
      "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded . . .
      ." 1 Ne. 3:7. The hymn that we sing reflects courage as well as
      submission to the Lord's will: "I'll go where you want me to go, dear
      Lord." Hymns, no. 270.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">A powerful example of
      courage is the story of Drusilla and James Hendricks. The story is found
      in the <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Henry Hendricks Genealogy</span>
      by Marguerite H. Allen.<a href="#N_10_"><sup> (10)</sup></a> Drusilla and
      James joined the Church in the 1830s, and in 1836 they moved to Missouri.
      Drusilla wrote,</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">"We never
      missed a meeting, for we loved the Saints and had confidence in them. We
      read considerable, mainly from the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and
      Covenants; had our children baptized when eight years old, and, in fact,
      could hardly keep them waiting until they were old enough.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">. . . [O]n
      March 23, 1838, our fifth child was born, and we called his name Joseph
      Smith Hendricks."<a href="#N_11_"><sup> (11)</sup></a></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Then the trouble
    with the mobs began. Drusilla wrote,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">"My husband had to stand
guard for three months, as the mob would gather on the outside settlements. The
brethren had to be ready and on hand at the sounding of a brass drum. At three
taps on the drum my husband would be on his horse in a moment, be it night or
day, while I and my children were left to weep, for that is what we did at such
times.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I was willing for him to go as I
always was until he fell in defense of the kingdom of God."<a href="#N_12_"><sup>
(12)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">On the night of October 24, 1838,
the family had prayer and went to bed. Then Brother Charles C. Rich called at
the door. He told James that they had word that the mob was on Crooked River ten
miles away. He said that they held two brethren as prisoners and were doing all
the damage that they could. Drusilla wrote,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">"I got his overcoat and put
his pistols in the pockets, then got his sword and belted it on him. He bid me
goodnight and got on his horse, and I took his gun from the rack and handed it
to him and said, `Don't get shot in the back.' I had got used to his going, so
went to bed and went to sleep."<a href="#N_13_"><sup> (13)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">About the time that James was
shot, Drusilla awoke suddenly. She awoke the children and watched the road.
Finally she saw Brother Emmet coming through the timber. He did not stop at his
house but yelled something about Brother Hendricks. Drusilla wrote,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">"The [Emmet] children soon
came over and told me that their father said that Brother Hendricks was shot.
Then I went to the field to give vent to my feelings . . . . I went back to the
house and found the children all crying"<a href="#N_14_"><sup> (14)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Shortly thereafter Mr. Snider came
to the house. He wiped his eyes, and Drusilla knew that he was crying. He said,
"`Mr. Hendricks wishes you to come to him.'"<a href="#N_15_"><sup>
(15)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Drusilla wrote,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">"We had four miles to ride,
and on reaching there we met nine of the brethren that were wounded and they
were pale as death. They were just going to get into the wagon to be taken to
their homes. I went into the house. Sister [Ann] Patten had just reached the bed
where her husband [David Patten] lay, and I heard him say, "Ann, don't
weep. I have kept the faith and my work is done." My husband lay within
three feet of Brother Patten, and I spoke to him. He could speak but could not
move any more than if he were dead. I tried to get him to move his feet but he
could not. This was <em>Thursday</em>, October 25, 1838, and the next <em>Tuesday</em>
was the battle of Haun's Mill, where men and boys were slaughtered . . . .</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">. . . My husband was shot in the
neck where it cut off all feeling to the body. It is of no use for me to try and
tell how I felt, for that is impossible, but I could not have shed a tear if all
had been dead before me. I went to work to try and get my husband warm but could
not. I rubbed and steamed him but could get no circulation. He was dead from his
neck down.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">. . . .We were compelled to stay at Far
West until after the surrender, when we went home. The mob had robbed the house
of bedding and, in fact, everything but my beds. My husband could not yet move
hand or foot. Then we had to settle our business matters and fix to get out of
the state. I went to work and sold what I could and gave our land for money to
buy two yoke of cattle. Finally we had to leave everything, only what we could
put into a little wagon.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We started March 17, 1839, for
Quincy, Illinois. . . .</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We soon got into a room, partly
underground and partly on top of the ground. The room was very close, and he
took sick and I had to lift him at least fifty times a day, and in doing so I
had to strain every nerve.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We had the cattle which had hauled
us here but could not sell them, but could hire them out for a small sum to
break prairie, so we hired them. We had one small heifer that the mob did not
take that gave us a little milk for twice a day, but in less than two weeks
there came a drove of cattle from Missouri and they drove her off with them, so
we were like Job of old . . . .</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In two weeks we neither had bread
or meat so we sent our oldest son, William, three miles out on the prairie to
the man who had hired our cattle. We had one spoonful of sugar and one saucer
full of cornmeal so I made mush of the meal and put the sugar on it and gave it
to my children. That was the last of the vegetables of any kind we had in the
house or on the earth. We were in a strange land among strangers. The conflict
began in my mind: `Your folks told you your husband would be killed, and are you
not sorry you did not listen to them?' I said, No I am not. I did what was
right. If I die I am glad I was baptized for the remission of my sins, for I
have an answer of a good conscience. But after that a third person spoke. It was
a still small voice this time saying, `Hold on, for the Lord will provide.' I
said I would, for I would trust in Him and not grumble.'"<a href="#N_16_"><sup>
(16)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Even though the circumstances were
dark, Drusilla Hendricks put her faith in the Lord. The Holy Ghost comforted
her: "Hold on, for the Lord will provide." I love her courageous
answer: "I said I would, for I would trust in Him and not grumble."
And the Lord did provide. Drusilla and her family successfully made the trip to
the Salt Lake Valley, where they lived long and productive lives.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>
(17)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Faith and courage overcome fear.
Paul wrote to Timothy, "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but
of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the
testimony of our Lord . . . ." 2 Tim. 1:7-8 To the Romans, Paul wrote,
"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ: for it is the power of
God unto salvation . . . ." Romans 1:16. When Joseph Smith was in Liberty
Jail, the Lord said, "[F]ear not what man can do, for God shall be with you
forever and ever." D&amp;C 122:9. And so he will be with us.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><b>PUTTING
THE GOSPEL FIRST</b></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The third principle of commitment
is putting the gospel first in our lives. Jesus said, "[T]hou shalt love
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
mind, and with all thy strength . . . ." Mark 12:30. It has been said that
if we do not put the gospel first in our lives, then at the final judgment it
won't matter what it was that we put in its place. Sometimes we want it both
ways. Just like the young people in Orderville, we want the blessings that come
from consecrating everything we have to the Lord, but we also want to hold
things back. We want to worship at the world's altar just a little longer. We
want to live the gospel and receive the blessings that it offers, but we also
want to wear the pants of the gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Some people are preoccupied with
acquiring material possessions. In the parable of the sower, Jesus spoke about
the person who received the seed "among the thorns." Matt. 13:22. The
person heard the gospel, but "the care of this world, and the deceitfulness
of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful." <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Id</span>.
Elder Featherstone has said that some people believe that although money can't
buy happiness, it at least affords us the particular kind of misery that we most
enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Let me tell you about an
experience that I had. When I was in law practice, my law firm had a car leasing
program in which each person received a very generous allowance for leasing a
car. If you chose not to lease an expensive car, you simply forfeited part of
the car allowance. So I went out and leased a beautiful sports car.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The car was the nicest toy I ever
owned. It was superbly engineered, and it drove like a dream. When the turbo
kicked in, the car would flatten your ears back against the headrest. A voice
would tell you when the door was open or the fuel level was low. It would say
something like, "Left door is ajar, Excellency." The volume control on
the stereo went from 1 to 10, and above 10 it had another setting that said:
"Liquify Cerebral Cortex." The night I brought the car home, I sat in
it until two a.m., trying out all the buttons and gadgets. My wife Nadine
refused to drive the car; it was too ostentatious.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">One year later I left law practice
and went to law school to teach. I gave up the sports car and bought a
14-year-old sedan. It did not have a turbo-charger; instead, it had a wimpo-charger.
There was a picture of my car in the dictionary, next to the definition of
"breach of warranty." But I have to give credit where credit is due.
My car was voted the car of the year--by the American Association of Tow Truck
Drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">What surprised me is that I did
not miss the sports car at all. Oh sure, the car was fun for a few months.
However, after the newness wore off, it was simply transportation. We've all had
the experience of wanting a certain material thing. We looked forward to getting
it, and it was exciting at first. After a while, however, the thrill wore off,
and we began looking forward to acquiring some other material thing, something
that was really going to satisfy us. To borrow an image from C.S. Lewis, wealth
is like an onion; when you peel off one layer, you simply discover another layer
underneath. This process continues until you realize that at the center of the
onion there is nothing at all. I learned for myself that wealth does not
satisfy; it does not bring joy. Living the gospel brings joy. Feeling the Spirit
brings joy. Loving and serving others bring joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">President J. Reuben Clark, a
former member of the First Presidency, said,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I come to see that the things
which men give in the way of honor and respect and office and position are
really of little worth. They are not worth what sometimes we feel we have to
give in order to obtain them. I come to know that worldly goods are of no
consequence whatever, save I have enough to eat, and to drink and reasonably to
wear, and that to attempt to leave wealth to my children will not only be a
futile effort but that it may prove a curse.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I do not mean by this that we
should cease to exert our efforts to become influential for good in our
communities. I do not mean that we should forget that we are living here and
have our lives to live. I do not forget that a reasonable provision for those
who come after us is a wise thing. I am only saying that none of these things is
worth the sacrifice of a principle. They are not worth the sacrifice of our
integrity, of our honor, of our righteous living.<a href="#N_18_"><sup> (18)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We should use our means to bless
others. The prophet Jacob taught,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">But before ye seek for riches,
seek ye for the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And after ye have obtained a hope
in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the
intent to do goodto clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate
the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted. (Jacob
2:18-19)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">President Packer has told the
story of Joseph Millett, a pioneer who shared his resources with others. Joseph
Millett had a large family, and he was going though hard times. He wrote in his
journal,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">"One of my children came in
and said that Brother Newton Hall's folks was out of bread, had none that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I divided our flour in a sack to
send up to Brother Hall. Just then Brother Hall came.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Says I, `Brother Hall, are you out
of flour?'</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">`Brother Millett, we have none.'</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">`Well, Brother Hall, there is some
in that sack. I have divided and was going to send it to you. Your children told
mine that you was out.'</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Brother Hall began to cry. He said
he had tried others, but could not get any. He went to the cedars and prayed to
the Lord, and the Lord told him to go to Joseph Millett.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">`Well Brother Hall, you needn't
bring this back. If the Lord sent you for it you don't owe me for it.'"</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">That night Joseph Millett wrote in
his journal, "`You can't tell me how good it made me feel to know that the
Lord knew there was such a person as Joseph Millett.'"<a href="#N_19_"><sup>
(19)</sup></a> The Lord does know us, and he knows our hearts. He expects us to
share our resources with those in need.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">President Hinckley told a more
recent story of sacrifice and unselfishness:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Some time back a small, bent,
elderly woman came to my office. For the purpose of this talk I shall call her
Mary Olsen, although that is not her name and she would not wish her identity
disclosed. She said she had just come over from the temple. She took from her
purse her checkbook. She said that she had been a widow for many years, that
life had not been easy for her. She had a great love for the Lord and his
Church. She had faithfully paid her tithing all her life. She felt she would not
live much longer. Now, she said, she felt she ought to be doing more to help
than she had done. In a hand shaky with age, she wrote a check for $5,000. She
handed it to me. I noted the address where she lived. It was in a poor
neighborhood. I confess that as I looked at that check tears came into my eyes.
I have held many larger checks than that in my hands. But as I held the check of
this widow woman, I was almost overcome by her faith and the seriousness of the
trust that was mine in the expenditure of her consecrated contribution.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>
(20)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">How do we keep our priorities
straight and not set our hearts on the things of the world? It is important to
pray and to read the scriptures every day. Reading the scriptures helps us to
feel the Holy Ghost. It reminds us of the Lord's commandments, the covenants
that we have made to keep them, and the blessings of the gospel. President
Marion G. Romney, a former member of the First Presidency, told this story:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">A few years ago as I began to
practice law, members of my family were a little uneasy. They were afraid I
would lose my faith. I wanted to practice law, but I had an even greater desire
to keep my testimony, and so I decided upon a little procedure which I recommend
to you. For thirty minutes each morning before I began the day's work I read
from the Book of Mormon--I also read from all the other standard works of the
Church, but I am talking now about the Book of Mormon--and in just a few minutes
a day I read the Book of Mormon through, every year, for nine years. I know that
it kept me in harmony, so far as I did keep in harmony, with the Spirit of the
Lord.<a href="#N_21_"><sup> (21)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We also need to keep our minds
focused on the gospel. We should try to control our thoughts. We should make
sure that the videos we watch, the music we listen to, and the posters on our
walls are in harmony with the gospel. The Lord said,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Let thy bowels also be full of
charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish
thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence
of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the
dews from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The Holy Ghost shall be thy
constant companion, and thy scepter and unchanging scepter of righteousness and
truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory
means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever. (</span>D &amp; C 121:45-46)</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Praying, reading the scriptures,
and keeping our minds focused on the gospel help us to put the gospel first in
our lives. The Lord has commanded, "Thou shalt have no other gods before
me." Ex. 20:3. President Ezra Taft Benson said, "We must put God in
the forefront of everything else in our lives. . . . When we put God first, all
other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives."<a href="#N_22_"><sup>
(22)</sup></a> In Doctrine and Covenants 88:67, the Lord said, "And if your
eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and
there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light
comprehendeth all things."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">
<b>HAVING
AN ETERNAL PERSPECTIVE</b></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The fourth principle of commitment
is having an eternal perspective. The Plan of Salvation was presented to us when
we lived with our Heavenly Father in the premortal existence. The Proclamation
on the Family says,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In the premortal realm, spirit
sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted
His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly
experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her
divine destiny as an heir of eternal life.<a href="#N_23_"><sup> (23)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">When the foundations of the earth
were laid, "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
shouted for joy." Job 38:7. We rejoiced over the Plan of Salvation and the
opportunity to come to earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Brigham Young said,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We talk about our trials and
troubles here in this life: but suppose that you could see yourselves thousands
and millions of years after you have proved faithful to your religion during the
few short years in this time, and have obtained eternal salvation and a crown of
glory in the presence of God; then look back upon your lives here, and see the
losses, crosses, and disappointments, the sorrows . . ., you would be
constrained to exclaim, "But what of all that? Those things were but for a
moment, and we are now here. We have been faithful during a few moments in our
mortality, and now we enjoy eternal life and glory . . . ."<a href="#N_24_"><sup>
(24)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">What are the blessings that come
from committing ourselves to the gospel? The most important blessing is Eternal
life, the kind of life that God lives. We give everything we have to our
Heavenly Father, and in return he gives everything he has to us. In the Doctrine
and Covenants 84:38, the Lord said, "And he that receiveth my Father
receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given
unto him."</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">What makes this possible is the
atonement. We say that we are "redeemed." The word "redeem"
comes from a Latin word meaning "to buy back." For example, when a
mortgage has gone into default, we redeem (or buy back) the property to save it
from loss. Through the atonement, the Savior has bought us back and saved us
from loss. We belong to him. This means that it is our obligation to do as he
asks and to keep his commandments. We commit ourselves to him because he has
first committed himself to us. We try to submit ourselves to his will. Job
suffered devastating trials and losses. But his commitment to the Lord was
unchanged. Job said, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him . . . . He
also shall be my salvation . . . ." (Job 13:15-16).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Elder Maxwell has said,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">[T]he submission of one's will is
really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God's altar. The
many other things we "give," brothers and sisters, are actually the
things He has already given or loaned to us. However, when you and I finally
submit ourselves, by letting our individual wills be swallowed up in God's will,
then we are really giving something to Him! It is the only possession which is
truly ours to give!</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Consecration thus constitutes the
only unconditional surrender which is also a total victory!<a href="#N_25_"><sup>
(25)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We need to pace ourselves. King
Benjamin counseled, "See that all things are done in wisdom and order, for
it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength."
Mosiah 4:27. We can't do everything at once, but most of us can do more to
fulfill our missions here on earth. As it says in the play, <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Shenandoah</span>,
"If we don't try we don't do, and if we don't do, what are we on this earth
for?"<a href="#N_26_"><sup> (26)</sup></a> The Lord blesses us as we strive
to serve him. With his help, we can succeed far beyond our natural abilities. As
Nephi said, "If God had commanded me to do all things I could do
them." 1 Ne. 17:50.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">By doing as the Lord asks, we
receive Eternal life. In addition, in this life we become better, stronger, and
happier people. We feel more joy in our lives. We are not here on earth to
satisfy our pride or our greed. We are not here to wear the pants of the
gentiles. We are here to serve God and to prepare ourselves and those around us
for Eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">President Faust has said,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">If we believe and are faithful, we
are promised all that the Father has. If we receive all that the Father has,
there is nothing more for us to receive in this life or the life to come. We
should remember that in our challenges and struggles against the powers of evil
and darkness, "they that be with us are more than they are be with
them." (2 Kings 6:16.) We belong to the greatest cause on earth. We are the
pioneers of the future. Let us go forth like the armies of Helaman and build the
kingdom of God. Like the royal army let us be "united, bold, and strong, .
. . marching forth to conquer on life's great battlefield." (See <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Hymns</span>,
no. 251.) All of these hopes, blessings, and opportunities will come to us if we
will only believe, and be not afraid.<a href="#N_27_"><sup> (27)</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">President Hinckley has said,</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I have a testimony of the gospel.
I testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world. This
is his Church and his work. Through faith, courage, putting the gospel first,
and having an eternal perspective, we can increase our commitment to the gospel
and become better disciples of our Savior. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</span></p>

LOVE OF THE LORDIN LANGUAGE AND LIVING</font></b>
</p>
<p>	On this historic occasion, I salute you graduates on your achievement.  Some finished with high honors and
deserve special praise.  And I suppose there are some who just barely made it.  No matter!  We all rejoice together. 
To each of you and your families, I extend sincere congratulations.</p>
<p>	May I take this opportunity to express thanks for the beautiful music rendered at general conference by the
combined choir from Ricks College.  It was wonderful.</p>
<p>	This is likely to be the last year for students to graduate from Ricks College.  The institution itself will soon
be graduating--to become Brigham Young University - Idaho.  Kudos to Ricks College, President Bednar, faculty,
and staff for that significant prospect and promotion.</p>
<p>	Normally at commencement exercises, the invited speaker is expected to encourage graduates to pursue
proud dreams and high hopes.  Sorry, but I won't do that.  It is too easy.  It doesn't take much determination to
dream or to hope.  It is much more difficult, especially in our day and age, to achieve in those areas that really matter
most.<br />
</p>
<p align="CENTER"><b>PERSONAL AND FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>
<p>	I refer to the need to measure up to one's personal potential and to succeed in one's family responsibilities. 
Today I would like to chat with you about these matters.  Your greatest challenges and rewards will be found in
mastering yourself and in strengthening your family.  Above all else, you should strive to become a good husband or
wife, a responsible father or mother, and a respected citizen in the kingdom and family of God.  Many, if not most of
you, have not yet selected a spouse.  I can't think of a more important decision for you to make.  My counsel to you
on this topic is simple: "O be wise"<a href="#N_1_"><sup> (1)</sup></a> and good luck!  Remember, at the side of each successful man is a wonderful
wife and a surprised mother-in-law.</p>
<p>	Seriously, in this world smitten and saturated with spiritual decay, we often hear slogans that appeal to
appetites and temptations of the flesh, such as "obey your thirst," "buy now, pay later," "everyone is doing it," and so
on.  It takes a resolute character to resist enticements that would take one on a downward path.</p>
<p>	Regarding such, James counsels, "Blessed is the man that [withstands] temptation: for when he is tried, he
shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him."<a href="#N_2_"><sup> (2)</sup></a></p>
<p>	Society's spiritual slide has developed during a time of unparalleled progress in communication,
technology, and transportation.  Meanwhile, despite this progress, human nature hasn't changed.  We still eat bread
by the sweat of our brow.<a href="#N_3_"><sup> (3)</sup></a>  And we still have physical appetites that need to be disciplined.</p>
<p>	Reports in the media describe newsworthy events.  But the truly good deeds--the small, everyday actions of
ordinary life--generally go unreported.  Noteworthy examples are the employee who gives an honest day's work, the
employer who rewards loyalty and service, and the Samaritan who stops to help someone in need.  They include the
hiker who carries out his own trash and the craftsman who works with a sense of enduring creation.  Especially
praiseworthy are the man who accepts responsibility for the children he has fathered, the father who wants the
respect of his children more than worldly acclaim, and the mother who nurtures an infant as a sacred trust and not as
a second-class chore. </p>
<p>	You graduates have gained a degree designed to give you opportunity in the global marketplace.  In most
cases you will be compensated according to the value society places upon your service.  But remember--there is
another side to your diploma from Ricks College.  It bears an unwritten code that prompts you to heed teachings of
prophets such as President David O. McKay, who said,</p>
<p><em>"True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature or art,
but in the development of character.  True education awakens a desire to conserve health by keeping the
body clean and undefiled.  True education trains in self-denial and self-mastery.  True education regulates
the temper, subdues passion and makes obedience to social laws and moral order a guiding principle of
life.  It develops reason and inculcates faith in the living God as the eternal loving Father of all."</em><a href="#N_4_"><sup> (4)<br />
</sup></a></p>
<p align="CENTER"><b>LOVE OF THE LORDIN LANGUAGE</b></p>
<p>	I urge you to live your lives in accord with the Lord's teachings and let your language reflect that
refinement.  Your manner of speech will then stand in stark contrast to the lazy language of our day, so liberally
laced with casual slang and sleazy, filthy, and profane expressions.  Sloppy language portends sloppy ways.</p>
<p>	In your language, strive for a more excellent way.<a href="#N_5_"><sup> (5)</sup></a>  Pattern your manner after that of President Gordon B.
Hinckley.  Even in his informal conversation, his language is elegant and eloquent.  Carry from this
institution--sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--a language that lifts and a personal
patina that radiates purity and refinement.<br />
</p>
<p align="CENTER"><b>LOVE OF THE LORDIN LIVING</b><br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>	Your investment here at Ricks will bring joy to you if you live as a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Acquire His qualities of civility and concern for others.  Learn to reach out, to lift and encourage people.  As you
cultivate qualities of kindness, courtesy, and respect for others, your life's work will be more fulfilling than if you
were to pursue goals strictly with an eye single to your own glory.</p>
<p>	Enduring joy comes neither from amassing material wealth nor in doing reportable deeds.  True joy comes
from becoming all that you may become.  Your potential for personal greatness will be enhanced as you come unto
Christ and become one with Him.</p>
<p>	I commend the youth who set worthy goals.  Some of you know exactly what you want to do and where you
want to go.  Some of you don't.  But whoever you are and wherever you go, I invite you to come to the outstretched
arms of Jesus.<a href="#N_6_"><sup> (6)</sup></a>  Wherever else you think you may be going, come unto Him first.   You will find your greatest
success and happiness when yoked with Him.  In His love, your precious families can be linked together forever,
according to the eternal ordinances and covenants that He has established.  I invite you to learn of Him, to follow
Him, and love Him as I do.</p>
<p>	I know of no other way for you to find true happiness.<a href="#N_7_"><sup> (7)</sup></a>  Sometimes we try to come unto Him too
tangentially, with a focus on meetings, activities, or procedures.  Important as they may be, we should strive to
emulate His example and develop a deep understanding of and gratitude for His Atonement.  Only as we know the
divine attributes of the Father and of the Son can we gain enduring faith in them.</p>
<p>	In this world, nothing is more burdensome than sin.  It is the heaviest cross that men and women ever bear. 
I believe you young women and men to be part of the greatest generation ever to live upon the earth.  Nevertheless,
the world around us is an increasingly hostile and sinful place.  Occasionally, that can splash onto us and put us in
very deep water.</p>
<p>	To anyone so struggling, know that you can be redeemed.  You can be made whole.  All that He asks is that
you walk, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, away from darkness into His light.  He has "borne our griefs, and
carried our sorrows," Isaiah declared, "and with his stripes we are healed"<a href="#N_8_"><sup> (8)</sup></a>--if we truly seek Him.</p>
<p>	Follow the Good Shepherd, brothers and sisters, and be a positive part of His fold.  Remember that His
Church is not intended to be a sanctuary for the sinless; it to be a hospital of hope for those who want to get well.  Do
whatever you have to do to be fully in the fold.  For some that means to live with greater faith, to believe more.  For
others it means to repent.  For all of us it means to live more by the promptings of the Holy Ghost and to "press
forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men."<a href="#N_9_"><sup> (9)</sup></a></p>
<p>	One of the peculiar ironies of life is that the very source of help being offered is the very thing from which
we, with our mortal myopia, tend to flee.  I have seen good people balk at baptism.  I have seen wonderful young
men turn their backs on mission calls.  I have seen sweethearts run from marriage and married couples flee from the
privilege of parenthood.  Why should we run from the very opportunity that would bless us and bring us joy?  Gospel
commitments are never to be feared, but to be pursued with purpose and hope.</p>
<p>	We have a covenant relationship with the Lord.  We have been bought with a price--through His atoning
blood.  We are His disciples, dependent upon Him for light, life, and all blessings.</p>
<p>	As you leave Ricks to advance your education or career, you can make a difference in this world.  You are
the "hope of Israel, Zion's army, children of the promised day."<a href="#N_10_"><sup> (10)</sup></a>  As disciples of the Lord engaged in His holy
work, each of you can lend a hand.  As you remain true to your covenants, your power will be enriched by His
power.</p>
<p>	Together we go forward as His Saints, "the covenant people of the Lord, . . . armed with righteousness and
with the power of God in great glory."<a href="#N_11_"><sup> (11)</sup></a>  May you ever love the Lord and manifest that love by your language and
your living.  </p>
<p>	I love you, dear brethren and sisters, and leave my blessing with you, with thanks for your faith and all that
you can become.  God lives!  Jesus is the Christ!  His church has been restored in these latter days!  President
Gordon B. Hinckley is God's prophet to all the world, I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="center"><b>The return of Thomas E. Ricks<br />
<font size="2">as portrayed by R. Brent Kinghorn, Community Services Vice
      President</font><br />
      June 6, 2001</b>
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to come back to Rexburg. My, my, it has changed since I first
came here in &#8217;83. (Now that&#8217;s 1883 for you young fellers out there.) We came
in the winter that year, and there was 18 inches of snow on the ground. And it
was cold! That spring we had to build canals, ferries, bridges, roads and a
meeting house and survey the town site. And it was muddy! My, it has changed.</p>
<p>Here just north of us, we surveyed and plotted out the first 10 blocks of our
town site. Back then each block consisted of four lots of 2 ½ acres each, and a
person could pick up a lot for only $3.13 a piece. I hear the price has gone up
a little since then. And looking around, I&#8217;m amazed at how many homes they are
putting on those lots. I keep wondering where a soul will keep his cow and pigs
and chickens. Why, there&#8217;s no room at all on these little lots any more.</p>
<p>We built the first home in Rexburg, you know. It was a one room, 15' x 18'
log home. It had a dirt roof, and it wasn&#8217;t very nice compared to what my wife
Elizabeth Jane left in Cache Valley. But I built her a nicer four-room, frame
house with real shingles for the next winter.</p>
<p>Yup, Rexburg has changed a lot. After I passed on, they named the town after
me, you know&#8211;using the German version of Ricks, which was Rex. Actually, I was
embarrassed about the whole thing.</p>
<p>I must admit that I had already lived a long life by the time I came to the
Upper Snake. But life had been good to me. I was born in 1828 in Western
Kentucky. (Are any of you here that old? A couple of these faculty look like
they could be.)</p>
<p>I knew the Prophet, Joseph Smith, you know. I met him in 1843 in Nauvoo with
my father when I was just a boy of 14. I personally heard him prophecy that the
Saints would &quot;. . . be scattered, and established by themselves in the
Rocky Mountains.&quot;</p>
<p>I was baptized into the Church when I was16, and I attended the first
conference of the Church held in the Nauvoo Temple in October of 1845. I even
worked on that temple. It was something to see as you came up the Mississippi,
rounded the bend, and saw it there gleaming white up on the bluff.</p>
<p>When I was 17, I was ordained an elder. We did things different in those
days. Why, a man was a man by the time he was 15 or 16 then.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s enough about me. I hear that some of my grandchildren and great
grandchildren might be here today&#8212;the few who are left. And that many of my
great, great grandchildren are here&#8212;and even some of my great, great, great
grandchildren. Could that be possible? President&#8212;what&#8217;s your name again,
young feller? Yes, yes, Bednar. Would it be appropriate to have them stand? How
about grandchildren first. Are any of them here? Good, good. Now, what about
great grandchildren? Now how about great, great grandchildren? And are there any
great, great, great grandchildren? Please, please, any of you who are part of
our family, stand right up. Wonderful, wonderful!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to get to visit with you all. I know you all come from one of my
dear wives. I imagine that some of you are Tabitha&#8217;s descendants, others are
from Tamar, and others from Jane, or Ruth or Ellen Marie. My, my what handsome
children you are.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been told that I eventually had 238 grandchildren, and I have also been told
that I had 700-800 great grandchildren and over 4,000 great, great grandchildren, and
who knows how many
                              great, great, great grandchildren. I decided that
                              this year, 2001, would be a good time to come back
                              and visit my school and see what you&#8217;ve done
                              with it.. It was 100 years ago when I left here
                              for good&#8212;1901, September, it was. I was 73 years
                              old at the time. I just checked out of this life
                              and went to the next. I want you to know it&#8217;s
                              nice there too. Beautiful, all the time. You&#8217;ll
                              like it.</p>
<p>Well, enough of that. I decided to come when I got wind that they were
      planning to take down my building&#8212;the old rock one. We put a lot of
      sweat and tears into that building. Cost us a lot of money, too. I and a
      few others raised $40,000 to help build it. That was a lot of money then,
      you know.</p>
<p>I and several others were aware that it caught on fire when they tried
      to bring it down last fall. Jacob Spori, Douglas Todd, A. B. Christensen,
      and John Clarke, and others. We all had pretty fond memories of that grand
      old building. I hear that they are going to replace it with a building
      that will look a lot like the original structure. That would please us. We
      sure loved that old building.</p>
<p>I heard, too, that they are going to make this school a four-year
      school. That was done back in &#8217;48, too, you know. It didn&#8217;t last but a
      few years then, but I guess they know what they are doing.</p>
<p>I even heard that they are going to change the name of the college to
      BYU-Idaho. That&#8217;s something! It doesn&#8217;t bother me though. Gosh, I was
      embarrassed when they named it after me in the first place. Brigham Young!
      That&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>I knew Brigham Young, too, you know. I was there when he organized the
      mass exodus from Nauvoo in February of 1846. Oh, it was cold. The
      Mississippi froze solid it was so cold. I followed Brother Brigham on the
      ice across the Mississippi. It was something to see, those hundreds of
      wagons and horses and cattle and people crossing that frozen river. I
      still remember how cold it was. But I supported him then, and I support
      him now.</p>
<p>I followed him across the plains too. He was quite a leader. I had to
      wait a year to leave until 1848 after Brother Brigham came back from Utah
      and told us all about it. I was in Heber Kimball&#8217;s group, and we were
      right behind Brother Brigham&#8217;s group that year. On the way, we had a
      little run-in with the Indians. I was shot three times. The Lord preserved
      my life though. Brother Heber gave me a blessing. I carried those three
      balls with me on my backside all through my mortal life, and I didn&#8217;t
      get rid of them until I got over on the other side.</p>
<p>Brother Brigham called me on a couple of missions in those early years
      in Utah. He even asked me to take a second wife. You young folks don&#8217;t
      know how much faith and courage that took. It was a hard thing for my wife
      Tabitha to accept and for me to do. But I did it because Brother Brigham
      said it was right and I believed him. He was a prophet, you know. I knew
      it and so did the other saints. You could see it in his eyes.</p>
<p>No, I feel okay about this name change. Brigham Young University-Idaho.
      That&#8217;s okay. And by the way, I feel Brother Brigham would feel okay
      about it too. He might be embarrassed about it, but I think he would be
      pleased. Downright pleased.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I should be giving you some counsel now that you are
      graduating from our school. I guess the question I&#8217;d like to ask you is,
      &quot;What are you going to do with your education?&quot; There should be
      a value to one&#8217;s education. Our people felt that way back when we
      founded this school. That&#8217;s why we started this it in the first place.
      And we wanted a school where we could even teach the principles of the
      multiplication tables in the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ, if we
      so desired. And we did, and I hear the faculty here are still doing that.</p>
<p>Over the years we kept stressing that concept as we progressed from an
      elementary to a secondary school and then to a college&#8211;even after I was
      gone. And I hear it is still so today! We created this school under the
      direction of the First Presidency, and it&#8217;s still operated under their
      leadership and direction. That&#8217;s why I know you have an education&#8211;and
      a good one. Those Brethren would never have let this school proceed if it
      weren&#8217;t doing what the Lord wanted it to do.</p>
<p>So you can leave here and go wherever you want&#8212;in the work force, to
      other colleges or universities&#8212;and you can hold your heads up high and
      you can compete with the best of them. That&#8217;s the value of your
      education from Ricks College. And some of you will stay on as it becomes
      BYU-Idaho and continue your education here, and you&#8217;ll do fine too. The
      Brethren will see that you get the finest education possible here.</p>
<p>Now, what I hope for you, however, is that you&#8217;ve also learned some
      other things here. How to become people of integrity&#8212;honest people,
      fair-minded people, dependable, and faithful. That&#8217;s what this world
      needs is people like that. Oh, book-learning is good&#8211;but it&#8217;s
      secondary to becoming people of integrity and people of faith.</p>
<p>Now, I want to leave you my blessing. I want you to know that the Lord
      is pleased with each of you and with your accomplishments. I, therefore,
      bless you for this. I bless you with confidence in yourself and in the
      future. I bless you with increased faith in the gospel and with a desire
      to serve your fellow man.</p>
<p>I bless you with courage to go forth and challenge the way things are
      being done and to show the world a more righteous way. I bless you with a
      love for others. I bless you with a desire to stand tall. I bless you with
      the same things, in fact, that our new prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, has
      asked of all of us in that new book he wrote, <i>Standing for Something</i>.
      Have you read it? In it he talks about ten virtues that will bless you
      forever. May I share them with you? He&#8217;s a prophet, too, you know:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the only force that can erase the differences between
              people or bridge the chasms of bitterness.</p>
<p>In our day, those found in dishonesty aren&#8217;t put to death,
              but something within them dies, he said. Conscience chokes,
              character withers, self-respect vanishes, integrity dies. How
              cheaply some men and women sell their good names.</p>
<p>Morality</p>
<p>Both experience and divine wisdom [in his opinion] dictate that
              moral virtue and cleanliness pave the way<i> </i>that leads to
              strength of character, peace of mind and heart, and happiness in
              life.</p>
<p>Civility</p>
<p>Civility [he points out] carries with it the essence of
              courtesy, politeness, and consideration of others.<i> </i>All of
              the education and accomplishments in the world will not count for
              much unless they are accompanied by marks of gentility, of respect
              for others, of going the extra mile.</p>
<p>Learning</p>
<p>No matter how old we become [he says], we can acquire knowledge
              and use it. We can gather wisdom and profit from it. We can grow
              and progress and improve&#8212;and, in the process, strengthen the
              lives of those within our circle of influence.</p>
<p>Forgiveness and Mercy&#8212;the Twin Virtues</p>
<p>Hatred always fails, and bitterness always destroys [he has
              wisely taught].</p>
<p>Thrift and Industry&#8212;Getting our Houses in Order</p>
<p>[He] commends to all the virtues of industry and thrift, which
              [he] believes go hand in hand. The<i> </i>labor and thrift of the
              people make a nation, a community, or a family strong. Work and
              thrift make the family independent.</p>
<p>Gratitude</p>
<p>Gratitude [he emphasized] is the beginning of civility, of
              decency and goodness, of a recognition that we cannot afford to<i>
</i>be arrogant. We should walk with the knowledge that we will
              need help every step of the way.</p>
<p>Optimism</p>
<p>My plea [he said] is that we stop seeking out the storms and
              enjoy more fully the sunlight. I am suggesting [he adds] that as
              we go through life, we &quot;accentuate the positive,&quot; that
              we look a little deeper for the good, that we still our voices of
              insult and sarcasm, that we more generously compliment and endorse
              virtue and effort.</p>
<p>Faith&#8211;Our Only Hope</p>
<p>[He concludes by saying] great buildings were never constructed
              on uncertain foundations. Great causes were never brought to
              success by vacillating leaders. Faith has always been, and always
              must be, at the root of any meaningful practice and endeavor.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I want for all of you. Stand tall! I&#8217;m proud of you
      all. I love you. It&#8217;s been good to be here with you and with so many
      members of my family. God bless you all! I&#8217;ll check back and see how
      things are going in another 100 years or so. And, who knows, maybe then
      Brigham can come, too. Good-bye and God bless!</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, welcome to Education Week. I am delighted to be
        here with you this morning. I especially appreciate and am thankful for
        Sister Bednar's insightful instruction and powerful testimony. I pray

<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Greatest
        Questions of Life</span></strong></p>
<p>Elder John A. Widtsoe stated that</p>
<p>&quot;<em>The second greatest question of life was asked by the
        ancient Psalmist: 'What is man, that thou art mindful of him?' In
        importance, this query is next only to that concerning the nature of
        God. Inability to answer this question has often defeated fervent faith.
        The correct answer has enabled men and nations to build their futures
        securely. Faith has been most effective when accompanied by an
        understanding of man's relationship to Deity. The way out of the world's
        tragic chaos, the terror of poverty, sickness and war must be
        illuminated by a comprehension of man's nature and destiny.</em>&quot; (<strong>Conference
        Report</strong>, October 1936, p. 97)</p>
<p>&quot;<em>No greater ideal has been revealed than the supernal truth
        that we are the children of God, and we differ, by virtue of our
        creation, from all other living things. No idea has been more
        destructive of happiness; no philosophy has produced more sorrow, more
        heartbreak and mischief; no idea has done more to destroy the family
        than the idea that we are not the offspring of God, only advanced
        animals, compelled to yield to every carnal urge.</em>&quot; (&quot;The
        Moral Environment,&quot; <strong>General Conference Report</strong>,
        April 4-5 1992, p. 92)</p>
<p>God is the supreme governor of the universe and the father of
        mankind. When we speak of God, it is generally the Father to whom we
        refer, and all mankind are His children. Mankind has a special
        relationship to God that differentiates men and women from all other
        created things; we are literally God's offspring, made in his image,
        whereas all other things are the work of His hands. (See <strong>Bible
        Dictionary</strong>, pp. 681-682)</p>
<p>The nature of this relationship between God and his children is
        highlighted in the Pearl of Great Price in the first chapter of the Book
        of Moses. In this chapter God reveals Himself to and converses with
        Moses. In verse 3 we read:</p>
<p><em>And God spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I am the Lord God
        Almighty, and Endless is my name; for I am without beginning of days or
        end of years; and is not this endless?</em></p>
<p>Thus, in verse 3 Moses begins to learn the answers to the greatest
        question of life<font face="CG Times"></font>the question about the identity and nature of God. And
        in the first line of verse 4, he begins to learn the answer to the
        second greatest question of life, the question of, &quot;What is
        man?&quot; (Psalms&nbsp;8:4): &quot;<em>And, behold, thou art my son; .
        . . .</em>&quot; The identity of Moses as a son of God is reiterated
        again powerfully in verses 6 and 7 and, significantly, serves as the
        primary source of protection as the adversary tempts Moses, as described
        in verses 12-22. Moses was blessed and protected precisely because he
        knew who he was.</p>
<p>In our day, the assault on the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood
        and sisterhood of His children has grown more relentless, more bold,
        more direct, and more sophisticated. For example, we live at a time and
        in societies wherein the procreative powers bestowed upon us by a loving
        Father increasingly are viewed as a selfish and animalistic appetite to
        be satisfied &quot;here and now&quot; rather than as a sacred privilege
        and responsibility with eternal consequences. We live at a time wherein
        the family unit of a father and a mother and children, one of the
        central features of the Father's eternal plan of happiness, is viewed by
        many as antiquated and obsolete. We live at a time wherein individual
        rights frequently are emphasized above covenant responsibilities and the
        collective good. We live at a time wherein speaking the name of God the
        Eternal Father is ever more controversial in schools and other public
        settings<font face="CG Times"></font>unless, that is, His name is taken in vain. And we live in a
        time wherein even those who should know better become too busy, too
        preoccupied, and too distracted to consistently worship the Father
        through meaningful family prayer and family scripture study. Perhaps the
        words of Nephi to his brothers Laman and Lemuel are equally applicable
        to our world today:</p>
<p><em>Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your
        God. . . . yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath
        spoken unto you in a still small voice, <strong>but ye were past feeling</strong>,
        that <strong>ye could not feel his words</strong>; . . . .</em> (1&nbsp;Nephi
        17:45, emphasis added)</p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Family: A
        Proclamation to the World</span></strong></p>
<p>Earlier I suggested that understanding who and what we are as
        children of God has never been more needed than it is today. May I also
        suggest that the same God who spoke with Moses face-to-face and
        declared, &quot;<em>And, behold, thou art my son; . . .</em>&quot;
        (Moses 1: 4,6,7), has recently spoken again to reaffirm and reinforce
        that same message to us through living apostles and prophets. As we
        learn in section 1 of the Doctrine and Covenants, &quot;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<em>&nbsp;whether
        by my own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same&quot;</em>
        (D&amp;C 1:38). Brothers and sisters, <em>The Family: A Proclamation to
        the World</em> is a timely gift from a loving Father delivered through
        His living apostles and prophets. He has never left us to guess about
        what matters most in life, and He helps us to know who we are as His
        children and what we may become. Please listen carefully to these
        significant statements from the Proclamation and notice the connection
        between the Father's plan and our identity as His sons and daughters.</p>
<p><em>We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles,
        of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim
        that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the
        family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His
        children.</em></p>
<p><em>All human beings<font face="CG Times"></font>male and female<font face="CG Times"></font>are created in the image of
        God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of Heavenly parents, and,
        as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential
        characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and
        purpose.</em></p>
<p>It is interesting to me that the first three paragraphs of the
        Proclamation provide answers to the greatest questions of life, as those
        questions were defined by Elder Widtsoe. Clearly, studying and pondering
        over the doctrines contained in the Proclamation will help each of us
        better understand the answer to the question, &quot;<em>What is man,
        that thou art mindful of him?</em>&quot; (Psalms 8:4) and provide an
        &quot;<em>anchor to our souls</em>&quot; (Ether 12:4) in the midst of
        troubling and perplexing times.</p>
<p>Several years ago I participated in a training session at which
        President Boyd K. Packer presided. In his teaching President Packer
        emphasized the importance of the Proclamation and invited those of us in
        attendance to complete a seemingly simple assignment. That assignment
        has had a profound impact upon my life. Let me now briefly share the
        assignment with you.</p>
<p>Step #1: Get an ordinary sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Step #2: Draw a straight line down the middle of your paper.</p>
<p>Step #3: At the top of the left-hand column on your paper write
        &quot;The Lord's Way.&quot;</p>
<p>Step # 4: At the top of the right-hand column on your paper, write
        &quot;The World's Way.&quot;</p>
<p>Step #5: Now, in the left-hand column of your paper, write down every
        discrete statement of doctrine and principle you can identify in the
        Proclamation. For example, you might write this statement as your first
        entry in the left column: &quot;Marriage between a man and a woman is
        ordained of God.&quot; Continue in this manner and write down as many
        individual statements as you possibly can.</p>
<p>Step #6: For each statement of doctrine and principle in the
        Proclamation that you identify, write a contrasting statement describing
        &quot;The World's Way.&quot; For example, the world's description of
        marriage might read like this: &quot;Marriage between 'consenting
        adults' is both traditional and optional. Gender is not germane in
        marriage. Marriage is a contractual agreement between two individuals;
        God has nothing to do with it.&quot;</p>
<p>Let me provide just a few more examples of the contrast between
        &quot;The Lord's Way&quot; and &quot;The World's Way.&quot; Please
        notice, brothers and sisters, the starkness of the comparisons.</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Lord's Way</b></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#004040"><b>The World's Way</b></font></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, please keep in mind that this assignment has no
        &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; answers. What truly matters is
        engaging in an intensive process of studying and pondering the
        Proclamation; that is the right answer about which we should all be
        concerned. And the ultimate value of this exercise comes only when we do
        it ourselves--not when we simply read the answers generated or provided
        by someone else. Few experiences in my life have clarified and confirmed
        the answers to life's greatest questions in such a penetrating way. And
        I testify and promise that such a process produces a spiritual
        self-worth, a sense of direction and purpose, and a correct confidence
        that strengthens us to stand for truth in confused and complicated
        times.</p>
<p>Please turn with me in the New Testament to the fourth chapter of
        Matthew. In this chapter we learn about the Savior's preparation for his
        ministry and about Satan's strategies. As we read these verses, I will
        insert the corrections contained in the Joseph Smith Translation of the
        Bible. We will begin reading in verse 2.</p>
<p><em>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights (and had
        communed with God), he was afterward an hungered, (and left to be
        tempted of the devil.)</em></p>
<p><em>And when the tempter came to him, he said, <strong>If thou be the
        Son of God</strong>, command that these stones be made bread.</em></p>
<p><em>But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
        bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</em></p>
<p><em>Then (Jesus was taken up into the holy city, and the Spirit
        setteth him on the pinnacle of the temple),</em></p>
<p><em>(Then the devil came unto him and said,) <strong>If thou be the
        Son of God</strong>, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give
        his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear
        thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</em></p>
<p><em>(And again, Jesus was in the Spirit, and it taketh) him up into
        an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the
        world, and the glory of them;</em></p>
<p><em>(And the devil came unto him again, and said,) All these things
        will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</em></p>
<p><em>Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
        written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
        serve.</em></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we have all learned in our Sunday School
        classes that the bread in verse 3 can represent the temptations of
        physical desires and appetites, that &quot;casting thyself down&quot; in
        verse 6 can symbolize the temptation of gaining worldly recognition and
        prominence, and that the kingdoms and glory of the world in verse 8 can
        stand for the temptations of wealth, power, position, and prestige. May
        I suggest, however, that the three temptations to which we frequently
        refer in this episode are secondary in nature; they are not primary. The
        overarching and fundamental challenge to the Savior in each of these
        three confrontations is contained in the taunting statement, &quot;<strong><em>If
        thou be the Son of God</em></strong>.&quot; Satan's strategy, in
        essence, was to dare the Son of God to inappropriately demonstrate His
        God-given powers and, thereby, forget who He was. The adversary
        attempted to attack the Master's understanding of who He was and of His
        relationship with His Father. Thus, as the Savior prepared for and
        commenced His mortal ministry, the adversary assaulted His understanding
        of the answers to life's two greatest questions.</p>
<p>Now please turn with me to the twenty-seventh chapter of Matthew. In
        this chapter Jesus is accused and condemned before Pilate, mocked, and
        crucified. Consider, brothers and sisters, as we read selected verses
        from this chapter that the Savior of the world is close to finishing His
        atoning sacrifice. The Lord has been betrayed, physically battered, and
        has &quot;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>trodden the wine-press alone</em>&quot;
        (D&amp;C 76:107). Given His agony in the Garden of Gethsemane and His
        torture on the cross, there had been, perhaps, no time in His earthly
        ministry when He was more physically exhausted, spiritually spent, and
        emotionally drained. Obviously, the adversary knew that he had only one
        last chance to thwart the plan of the Father and interrupt the
        atonement. Given the Savior's condition and Satan's ultimate
        desperation, what temptation and strategy would the arch deceiver
        employ? We will begin reading in verse 38.</p>
<p><em>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right
        hand, and another on the left.</em></p>
<p><em>And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</em></p>
<p><em>And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in
        three days, save thyself. <strong>If thou be the Son of God</strong>,
        come down from the cross.</em></p>
<p><em>Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and
        elders, said,</em></p>
<p><em>He saved others; himself he cannot save. <strong>If he be the
        King of Israel</strong>, let him now come down from the cross, and we
        will believe him.</em></p>
<p><em>He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, <strong>if he will
        have him</strong>: for he said, I am the Son of God.</em></p>
<p><em>The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in
        his teeth.</em></p>
<p>The last and most potent of the fiery darts Lucifer could direct at
        the Savior, just as he had attempted at the beginning of the Master's
        mortal ministry, was aimed at the answers to life's two greatest
        questions. With all of his diabolical designs hanging in the balance,
        Satan again hurled the sneering challenges of &quot;<em>If thou be the
        Son of God</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>If he be the King of Israel</em>,&quot;
        and &quot;<em>if he will have him</em>.&quot; Interestingly, in this
        final scene the tempting taunts came through other people and not
        directly from the adversary.</p>
<p>May I suggest that the adversary will use his primary strategy on
        each of us, especially as we live in troubled and troubling times. He
        would have us conclude that God is not our Eternal Father and,
        therefore, He cannot possibly be mindful of us. However, the scriptures
        and living apostles and prophets teach and testify that indeed we are
        children of God, that &quot;he has sent [us] here, has given [us] an
        earthly home with parents kind and dear&quot; (Hymn&nbsp;301). Just as
        the Savior was strengthened through a correct understanding of who He
        was and His relationship with the Eternal Father, so we likewise can be
        blessed and protected by and through this eternal truth.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>What is man, that thou are mindful of him?</em>&quot;
        (Psalms 8:4). We are sons and daughters of God. &quot;Rich blessings are
        in store; if [we] but learn to do his will, [we'll] live with him once
        more&quot; (Hymn 301). I so testify and witness in the sacred name of
        Jesus Christ, amen.

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">It is a humbling experience to be invited to share the devotional message with you today. 
My prayer has been that we might be joined by the Holy Spirit, that we might be lifted and
directed and edified.  When I was first invited to speak today, I surveyed the students in my
economics class, asking them what they felt would be a good devotional topic.  I appreciate their
suggestions, because it gave me an insight as to what situations you are dealing with.  The
majority suggested that I talk about how to succeed in school and maintain a spiritual balance in
life beyond school.  Having given that subject some thought and prayer I am prepared to share
with you five gospel orientated principles that I believe are essential to your success in
completing your education and maintaining a spiritual balance in life beyond school.  I will use
as my text selected scriptures and personal experiences.  I will talk of David and Goliath; of the
apostle Paul's invitation to "put on the armor of God,&quot; of the Mormon pioneers, and words of
our beloved prophets today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As a young boy I remember attending Sunday School and hearing the story of David and
Goliath.  I remember sitting on the edge of my seat, looking at the picture depicting David, his
arm drawn back, a leather-tonged sling in his hand aimed at the giant Goliath.  My teacher told
the story in such a way I envisioned myself as David facing Goliath with a stone loaded into my
sling.  Goliath was a giant, armed with a

metal helmet, metal breastplate and metal

shin guards.  The picture depicted him

holding a spear in one hand that was as

long as he was tall.  David had no such

visible armor and he looked minuscule

compared to the towering giant.  I could

imagine the fear that must of been in

David's heart, but as I looked at the

picture I noted that David did not show

fear but determination and courage.  I was

excited as the story continued of how

David whirled the sling and with deadly

accuracy let the stone fly finding it's mark

in the forehead of the giant.  I cheered

when my teacher told of how David stood

upon Goliath after slaying him and held

aloft the sword of the giant,

demonstrating the victory. </p>
<p>Today we may not have to face a

physical Goliath, but there are definite
trials that will challenge us in our pursuit of education, marriage, family and careers.  There are
situations and decisions that we will face that have dangers in the form of fashions, fads, and
social activity of our own day and time.  Indeed there are mountains of social and economic
behavior that will test and try our testimony and resolve to live the gospel principles.  How can
we face the challenges of today?  What can we learn from the story of David and Goliath that
will help us to be successful in our schooling and maintain a spiritual balance in our life after
school?  Please turn with me to the book of First Samuel, Chapter 17, page 405 in the Old
Testament.  </p>
<p>The story of David and Goliath has been told and retold for many generations.  You will
remember the story of how Israel was at war with the Philistines.  In the first verses of this
chapter we learn that the Philistine army were camped on one hill and the army of Israel, led by
King Saul were camped on another hill, with a valley between them (v. 1-3).  The Philistines had
selected one man, "a champion out of the camp" (v4) named Goliath to represent the entire
Philistine army.  Goliath was a giant compared to any of the Israelite soldiers.  Indeed, he was
over nine feet in height and wore a protective coat of mail that weighted over 168 pounds alone! 
Each day Goliath would call a challenge to the Israelite army to send out a representative, a
champion soldier to meet him in the valley and there fight to determine which side would win the
war.  His challenge was the same each day for forty days and has some relation to our own
challenges we face even today.  Let's read beginning in verse 8 of chapter 17:</p>
<p>"If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I
prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us."</p>
<p>"And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man that
we may fight together."</p>
<p>"And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were
dismayed, and greatly afraid."  (v. 8-11)</p>
<p>The Philistines were a tribe from the Aegean Sea who had settled along the coast of
Palestine, bringing with them the roots of the Greek culture.  The Greek culture was given to the
worship of many different deities or gods and goddesses.  The Philistines would of believed that
multiple gods watched over them and directed their daily events, and would flock to shrines
called oracles to have their future told by the priest or priestesses.  Families and individuals tried
to please the gods with offerings and ceremonies.  The Philistines entered the land of Canaan
about the same time as the children of Israel did and were a very sophisticated, highly complex,
extremely warlike people.  They learned the art of iron smelting from the Hittite's and had the
military and economic advantage over the Israelites.   
		<span style="font-size: 11pt">(The ancient Greek culture made lasting
contributions to our own Western civilization in the form of the arts, government, philosophy,
mathematics and athletics all which influence our lives today.)  </span>They were a thorn in the side of Israel. 
The Philistines were at the time of Saul, and may very well represent in our lives today, enemies
of God.  Goliath stood as a symbol of those things that were against the teachings of God. 
President Spencer W. Kimball spoke of modern day Goliaths and warned: 		</p>
<p>"<strong>You will meet Goliaths who threaten you</strong>.  Whether your Goliath is a town
bully or is the temptation to steal or to destroy or the temptation to rob or the
desire to curse and swear; if your Goliath is the desire to wantonly destroy or the
temptation to lust and to sin, or the urge to avoid activity, whatever is your
Goliath, he can be slain.  But remember, to be the victor, one must follow the path
that David followed: 'David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the Lord
was with him.' (1 Samuel 18:14)" (Spencer W. Kimball, "The Davids and the
Goliaths," <em>Ensign,</em> Nov. 1974, 79)</p>
<p>What are your Goliaths?  How many Goliaths have you faced in your life?  How many
times have you heard the words of Goliath "I defy the armies and the God of Israel this day"? 
Modern day Goliaths may be in the form of a habit, a behavior, or a relationship.  Perhaps in our
own language you have heard Goliath this way: </p>
<p>The Goliath of David's time stated the conditions of the battle: If he won, the Israelites
would become slaves to the Philistines.  If the Israelite challenger won, the Philistines would be
slaves to the Israelites.  Modern day Goliaths issue the same conditions with their challenge, if
they win we will slaves to a behavior that will not allow us to return to our Father in Heaven.    
		</p>
<p>A prophet today has told us that we will meet Goliath(s) in our daily activities.  That
same prophet also told us that we can slay our Goliaths and that we can be the champion.  All we
have to do is to behave ourselves like David did and the Lord will be with us.  Let's read what
David did in order to slay the Goliath of the Israelites.  We'll jump ahead in the story of David
and Goliath to verses 38-40 and then come back to look at the earlier verses.  When David was
determined to face Goliath he first attempted to arm himself with the modern armaments
available to him.  He put on the helmet and coat of mail of Saul.  Then he strapped the sword of
Saul around his waist.  But David was not familiar with these protections, nor was he able to
move about in them very well.  Note his words at the end of verse 39:</p>
<p>"...And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for <strong>
<em>I have not proved</em></strong><em></em> them. 
And David put them off him."</p>
<p>Instead of using the armor of Saul, David turned to something that was familiar to him
and something that he had proved before.  Let's read verse 40:</p>
<p>"And he took his staff in his hand and chose him <strong><em>five smooth stones</em></strong><em></em> out of the
brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his
sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine."</p>
<p>So armed with a shepherds staff, his sling in his hand, and five smooth stones in his
shepherd's bag David went to meet Goliath.  We know the result of that meeting.  I have often
wondered why David picked up <strong>five</strong> stones.  What is significant about the number of five?  And
why was the author of the book of Samuel prompted to record that those five stones were
		<strong>smooth</strong>?  </p>
<p>May I suggest to you that those five smooth stones David used to slay his Goliath
represent five gospel based principles that we may use to slay our own Goliaths today?  May I
also suggest that the mention that the five stones were <em>smooth</em> implies that these gospel based
principles have been <strong><em>proven</em></strong><em></em> and tested on Goliaths of the past and present?  These five smooth
gospel stones represent personal habits or personal behavior that David possessed by which he
was able to defeat Goliath and <strong><em>if we acquire these five smooth gospel stones of behavior</em></strong><em></em> we too
will conquer our personal Goliaths as President Kimball has promised.  Let's look at the five
smooth stones of gospel based principles that David used in his defeat of Goliath.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The First Smooth Stone - 
		<em>Faith</em></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></p>
<p>The first smooth stone that David picked up may represent the first principle of the
gospel, the principle of <strong><em>faith</em></strong><em></em>.  David demonstrated great faith in God as he took on the giant
Goliath.  Let's read from verses 33-37:</p>
<p>32: 	And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy
servant will go and fight with this Philistine<span style="text-decoration: line-through">.</span></p>
<p>33 	And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man
of war from his youth.</p>
<p>34.	And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there
came a lion and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock;</p>
<p>35. 	And I went out after him, and smote him, ...</p>
<p>36. 	Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear:...</p>
<p>37. 	<strong>David said moreover, The Lord that delivered me out of the
paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver
me out of the hand of this Philistine.  And Saul said unto
David, Go, and the Lord be with thee.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As a youth David had been taught the principle of faith.  He had put his faith in the Lord
as he tended and protected his father's sheep.  David recognized that it was not by his own power
that he had killed the bear and the lion, it was by the power of God.  With that faith David met
Goliath.  </p>
<p><strong>From your youth you have been taught</strong> the principle of faith by your parents, your
teachers in seminary, Sunday school, primary and your church leaders.  You have been taught to
believe in God, our Father in Heaven, and in His son Jesus Christ.  You have been taught to trust
them when you are faced with a Goliath type situation.  <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Now you are away from your parents and those teachers</strong>.  As you continue your
formal schooling and informal education in society you will be exposed to different ideas and
philosophies of life.  As a missionary, I had been assigned to a small town in Northeastern
Oklahoma.  In that town was Northeastern Oklahoma State University, which at that time was
nationally known for it's "party school" environment.  While tracting one day, my companion
and I were invited to give a discussion to a young college coed, who was a freshman from the
state of New York.  As we began our discussion we were establishing the need for a prophet and
apostles in today's society.  In the course of the discussion, the young woman said,
"Do you think the ten commandments are valid today? Do you think that we need the ten commandments?"
		</p>
<p>To which she replied:	"Well, I used to think that too.  I was raised by my parents to believe that the ten
commandments were valid today and important.  But since I have come to
college, I have learned that we don't need them any more.  Man and the world
have become so smart and intelligent that we don't need the commandments.  We
have doctors and medicines that can cure anything and we have lawyers and
judges that settle any dispute or argument or if someone breaks the law.  We don't
need the ten commandments of the Bible any more."</p>
<p>This young woman was being exposed to the modern Goliath of the late 1960's and early
1970's.  She had been converted to the philosophies of the world.  She had dropped the smooth
stone of faith and had lost her direction in her pursuit of an education, replacing the smooth stone
and shield of faith with arrogance, conceit, and egotism.  Her Goliath was winning the battle. 
		</p>
<p><b>While serving a mission in Oklahoma I met Rick.</b>  Rick was 16 years old and was
searching for the truth.  Through a young woman, who was a strong member of the church, Rick
began taking the missionary lessons.  He believed the message and wanted to be baptized. 
However, he needed his parents permission, who would not agree to his embracing the gospel,
and would not give their permission.  He was told that if he did join the Church that he would be
evicted from his home and his family would disown him.  Rick had a decision to make.  Others
have had to make the same decision between Church and family, perhaps some of you here
today.  But Rick's situation was a bit different.  Rick was blind, had no eyesight and was totally
dependent upon his family.  The young woman that had introduced him to the gospel had read
the Book of Mormon to him and by exercising his faith and prayer he had gained a testimony of
the truthfulness of that book.  He picked up the smooth stone of faith, and made the decision to
be baptized.  His parents were true to their promise and Rick did loose his home and family.  But
through one miracle after another, Rick was blessed with another home, support and means to
progress and grow in the gospel and life.  Rick was able to defeat his Goliath by exercising faith.</p>
<p><strong>In another time 2,060 young men </strong>left their homes, following a prophet of God in
defense of their religion and freedom.  These young men had never fought in battle before, yet
they carried with them the smooth stone of faith and the shield of faith.  You are familiar with
these young men known as the "Stripling Warriors of Helaman".   When faced with their
Goliaths, the Lamanities, and asked if they would fight or not, they valiantly stated:
		</p>
<p>"... behold our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; then let
us go forth;... yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not
doubt, God would deliver them and they rehearsed ... the words of their mothers,
saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it."  (Alma 56:46-48) </p>
<p>"Now this was the <strong><em>faith</em></strong><em></em> of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their
minds are firm and they do <strong><em>put their trust in God continually.</em></strong><em></em>" (Alma 57:27)</p>
<p>These 2,060 young men met their Goliath and through their faith won the battle.  They
were true to the faith, true to their convictions, true to the faith of their fathers and mothers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Second Smooth Stone - 
		<em>Obedience</em></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></p>
<p>The second stone that David picked up may be the stone of <strong>
<em>obedience.</em></strong><em></em>  Obedience is the
first law of the gospel.  Through obedience we exercise the principle of faith.  David was in the
right place at the right time, because he obeyed his father.  If David had not obeyed his father,
Israel would of been under siege for a longer period of time.   Let's read verse 20 of I Samuel 17:</p>
<p>20.	And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper,
and took, <strong>and went, as Jesse had commanded him</strong>; and he came to the
trench, as the host was going forth to the fight,...</p>
<p>Obedience to parents is one of the original ten commandments given to Moses.  Faith and
obedience go together.  Without faith there would be no need for obedience and without
obedience, faith is dead.  Your faith will not grow without obedience.  One of my personal
Goliaths I have faced needed a combination of faith and obedience to conquer.

<p><strong>After completing my degree at BYU-Provo</strong> my wife and I moved to Pullman,
Washington to pursue a Ph.D.  From the first day in my graduate program at WSU, it was
obvious that I was the only LDS among both graduate students and faculty.  The habits and life
style of my colleagues and instructors were not consistent with mine, which led to a
confrontation between myself and one of the faculty members.  In my graduate program there
was a tradition called the "Friday night seminar", where the graduate students and the faculty met
in a social setting to visit and "rub shoulders" with each other.  It was a time that the students
could get to know the faculty more as individuals and visa versa.  The seminar would begin on
Friday afternoon, after the last class of the week, around 5 p.m. and was held at a local tavern, or
bar where alcoholic drinks were served.  All graduate students were expected to attend.  I didn't. 
Of course the obvious reason for not attending was my adherence to the word of wisdom.  The
not so obvious reason was I had been taught by my parents and leaders to "avoid the appearance
of sin" in every way.</p>
<p>After the first month or so, one of the professors approached me and after some light
conversation he stated, &quot;Steve, I haven't seen you at the Friday night seminars.  Why?"</p>
<p>I explained that I was just getting into the program and that I was struggling with the rigor
of the graduate courses, which required me to spend a lot of time at school in studies and classes. 
Each day of the week usually began about 5 a.m. and ended around 10 or 11 p.m. which didn't
allow me to see my family very much.  On Friday, I would put down my studies at 5 p.m. and go
home and be with my family.  The faculty member then suggested, &quot;Well, you know that it's real important that you get to know the faculty and that
we get to know you.  We are here to help you in your studies and we can help you
more if we know more about you, and the best place for us to get to know you is
at the Friday night seminars."</p>
<p>I expressed my appreciation to this faculty member for his concern and willingness to
help me.  Then I explained that because of my religion that I didn't drink alcohol and didn't
frequent taverns or bars because of the example it might set for my four young children.  His
response was quick and sharp, &quot;"Well it's just as important that you do attend.  If you don't start attending the
seminar on Friday night, you can kiss your Ph.D. degree goodbye.  I will make
sure you do not get your degree here."</p>
<p>I thanked him for his opinion and told him that he had to do what he felt he had to do, but
I had to do what I knew was right.  I would not be attending the Friday night seminars.  To
shortened the story, I did not attend the seminars, and through the intervention of the Lord with
one miracle after another, I did complete my degree within four years -- almost 1 to 2 years
earlier than most of the graduate students.  One graduate student that I had become friends with
came into my office after the first year and announced that he was going to have to drop out of
the program.  I asked him why.  He stated that he had become an alcoholic, that he had become a
slave to alcohol.  He said the problem first started with the social drinking of the Friday night
seminars, and then the social drinking turned to more frequent drinking until he could not control
it.  He was not the first to fall to the Goliath of disobedience.</p>
<p><strong>Elder M. Russell Ballard spoke of the</strong> social Goliaths that test our resolve to obey:</p>
<p>"Too many of our young men and women are succumbing to the pressures
imposed by a world saturated with evil messages and immoral behavior. Lucifer is
waging a vicious war for the souls of young and old alike, and the casualty count
is climbing. The standards of the world have shifted like the sands of a windblown
desert. That which was once unheard of or unacceptable is now commonplace.
The world's perspective has been so dramatically altered that those who choose to
adhere to traditional standards of morality are viewed as strange, almost as though
they must justify their desire to keep the commandments of God. </p>
<p>&quot;But one thing is certain: the commandments have not changed. Let there be no
mistake about that. Right is still right. Wrong is still wrong, no matter how
cleverly cloaked in respectability or political correctness." (April Conference
1999)</p>
<p>And in his address on the 6 B's last November President Hinckley has stated:</p>
<p>"  We live in a world that is filled with filth and sleaze, a world that reeks of evil.
It is all around us. It is on the television screen. It is at the movies. It is in the
popular literature. It is on the Internet. You can't afford to watch it, my dear
friends. You cannot afford to let that filthy poison touch you. Stay away from it.
Avoid it."</p>
<p>"  Avoid evil talk....Choose your friends carefully....Be clean.  Don't waste your
time in destructive entertainment.... Stay away from pornography...Stay away
from illicit drugs...Stay morally clean...." (First Presidency Message A Prophet's
Counsel and Prayer for Youth, January 2001 <em>The Ensign</em>, 2)<em></em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Third Smooth Stone - 
		<em>Service</em></span></strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></em></p>
<p>It is likely that David had learned to serve the Lord earlier in his life.  It is also likely that
he had been taught and had read the scriptures available at that time.  David was familiar with the
story of Joshua assisting Moses in leading the children of Israel out of Egypt and through the
wilderness.  It was Joshua who had led Israel in to the promised land, even the land the
Philistines were now attempting to take from them.  David probably read the account of Joshua
giving his last address to the children of Israel.  Listen for the action words associated with
"service" in these verses <span style="font-size: 10pt">Joshua 22:5; 24:14-15)</span>. 
		</p>
<p>David knew of the gospel principle of service and of serving God.  Today, we not only
have the scriptures with countless examples of service, we also have the example of our Pioneer
ancestors who we honor this month.  Day in day out as the pioneers walked the 1,300 miles
across the plains, they served each other, as they followed the prophet in faith to build a Zion in
the West.  As the hymn states:</p>
<p>Service was their watch-cry;<br />Love, became their guiding star;<br />Courage, their unfailing beacon,<br />Radiating near and far.<br />Ev'ry day some burden lifted,<br />Ev'ry day some heart to cheer,<br />Ev'ry day some hope the brighter,<br />Blessed, honored Pioneer!</p>
<p>(They The Builders of The Nation, <em>Hymns</em>, 36)</p>
<p>The Willie Handcart Company began ascending Rocky Ridge on October 23, 1856, and
then onto the rescue wagons at Rock Creek.  They were still about 300 miles east of Salt Lake
City, on the high plains of Wyoming.   This stony hill has a long ascent and rough rocks sticking
out of the trail like ridges.  This brave pioneer company of Saints had left their homes in Europe
with the ultimate goal of reaching Zion in the Great Salt Lake Valley.  They had put their faith
and trust in the call from the prophet, Brigham Young.  They had started late in the season from
Europe which made them even later in leaving Florence, Nebraska with their hastily built
handcarts.  The maximum amount of personal belongings that these handcart saints could bring
was a scant 17 pounds per person.  Food rations were limited and became short in supply as the
company moved across the westward trail.  The harshness of the trail, exposure to the elements,
scarcity of food and fatigue from over-exertion took it's toll as almost every day one or two or
more of the company died.  On October 19 a snow storm hit the company, stopping their trek. 
Now without any food, the entire company would surely perish if they didn't get help.  Help was
available at Rock Creek, but to reach it the company would have to cross Rocky Ridge.</p>
<p>Their day's journey covered a minimum of 12 miles, much of it uphill. A blizzard was
raging, with the wind blowing and 18 inches of snow on the level. Many of the pioneers were
wrapped in blankets and quilts to keep warm. The last of the company, including some ox teams
loaded with the sick and dying, didn't get in to Rock Creek until the following morning, 27
hours later. Besides the blizzard, and the steep journey up Rocky Ridge, they also had to cross
Strawberry Creek, before arriving at the rescue site of Rock Creek.</p>
<p>Archibald McPhail had been assigned the leader of his tent and was put in charge of
several single ladies. After they made the difficult journey over Rocky Ridge and into Rock
Creek, Archibald noticed that one of his single sisters was missing and went back to look for her.
He found her sitting on the other side of Strawberry Creek:</p>
<p>. . . He pleaded with her to come on, but she refused, saying she was going to stay there
and die. There was nothing to do but cross the stream and get her. He picked her up and as they
crossed the stream the ice broke and he was soaked with icy water to the waist.  
		</p>
<p>By the time he reached camp his clothes were frozen to him and he was taking heavy
chills. The air was cold and wet and the men were so weak and hungry they could not go in
search of dry wood to make a fire.  Without anything warm to eat or drink, he was placed in a
cold bed with the covering of a handcart pitched over him for a tent. There was a strong wind
blowing which blew it over three times, and they stopped trying to keep it up. He was in high
fever, and [his daughter] Henrietta sat by his bed brushing the snow from his face . . . 
		</p>
<p>Archibald rode in the sick wagon from then on until his death at the crossing of Bear
River. His daughter, Jane McPhail Peart, tells of his death: </p>
<p>My mother related to me a very touching story about my father's death. She was sitting in
the wagon in the night with her sick husband's head on her lap watching him as she knew he
could not live. Having a small piece of tallow candle, she prayed that the candle might last until
her husband should pass away; her prayer was answered for the light of the candle and the life of
her husband went out at the same time.  At the time of his death he was just thirty-nine years old. 
		</p>
<p>It's not very often in our own day and age that our service requires the ultimate sacrifice
of giving up one's life.  However, there are requirements of sacrificing time and perhaps
monetary resources.  President Hinckley has set an example of great service.  In his address to the
youth in November 2000 he said:</p>
<p>"You have a tremendous inheritance. You have a great background of noble
ancestry. Many of you are descendants of the pioneers, who died by the hundreds
and thousands in testimony of the truth of this work. If they were to look down
upon you, they would plead with you: "Be true. Be loyal. Be 'true to the faith that
our parents have cherished, true to the truth for which martyrs have perished.' "
They would say, "Faith of our fathers, holy faith, we will be true to thee till
death"... Be loyal to the Church under all circumstances. I make you a promise
that the authorities of this Church will never lead you astray. They will lead you in
paths of happiness." (First Presidency Message A Prophet's Counsel and Prayer
for Youth, January 2001 <em>The Ensign</em>, 2)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Fourth Smooth Stone - 
		<em>Prayer</em></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></p>
<p>The fourth stone that David picked up may represent <strong><em>praye</em></strong><em></em>r.  As David went to meet
Goliath he had a prayer in his heart.  Let's read verse 45:</p>
<p>What a great example of faith, obedience, service and prayer!  Every day you and I face
different Goliaths, the enemy of God who challenge us and test us.  Without the smooth stone of
prayer each day, those Goliaths will wear us down and defeat us.  I have a strong testimony of
prayer and of the power of God through prayer.  Listen to what President Hinckley said about the
smooth stone of prayer.  In addressing the youth in November he gives his last of the six "B's"
as:</p>
<p>"... be prayerful.  You cannot do it alone.... You know that He is the source of all
wisdom.  You need His help, and you know that you need His help.  You cannot
do it alone.  You will come to realize that and recognize that more and more as the
years pass.  So live in good conscience you can speak with the Lord.  Get on your
knees and thank Him for His goodness to you and express to Him the righteous
desires of your hearts.  <strong>The</strong> miracle of it all is that He hears.  He responds.  He
answers - not always as we might wish He would answer, but there is no question
in my mind that He answers...." (First Presidency Message A Prophet's Counsel
and Prayer for Youth, January 2001 <em>The Ensign</em>, 2)</p>
<p>I learned in my education pursuit that I couldn't do it alone.  The first class that I enrolled
in my graduate program at WSU was an advanced marketing class.  On the first day of class the
teacher started out by building a very mathematical econometric model of the demand function. 
The model was called the Slutksy equation and involved a high level of calculus and lots of
Greek notation.  At the end of the hour I knew I was in trouble and not prepared for that course,
but I stayed in it.  The first midterm exam came and consisted of only 5 essay questions, each
worth 20 points.  I had studied long and hard for that exam and felt confident that I would do
well.  I started the exam and wrote about a page and a half for each question, feeling that I had
covered all of areas required by each question.  I handed my exam in, confident that I had passed
with flying colors.  The next class period the graded exams were returned.  The red inked
comments on the top of my paper indicated that I had the "flying colors" and also indicated that I
had scored a record score.  My score and the professor's note at the top of my exam read: "15 pts
out of 100 pts.  This is the lowest score that I have ever given in all of my 20 years of teaching. 
What is wrong with you?  (1) You are not prepared for this program or (2) You don't want to be
here.  Come and see me."  I was of course shocked and went to see the professor as he had
invited me to.  I explained to him that I was not prepared for the rigor of the program, to which
he said, "You have two options, (1) Get yourself up to speed or (2) Drop out."
		</p>
<p>I left his office and did a lot of self reflection and evaluation.  I realized that in addition to
not having the proper academic preparation, I had not really prepared myself through proper
prayer.  While I had been saying my prayers each day, I hadn't been really praying with the
sincerity and intent that the scriptures had suggested.  I changed my behavior of prayer and as a
result my study habits changed, my understanding increased and I completed that initial course
with a "B" grade.  I testify that it was with the smooth stones of prayer, faith, obedience, and
service that I successfully completed that program.</p>
<p>The Lord promises us in Doctrine &amp; Covenants 10:5:</p>
<p>"Pray always, that you may come off conqueror, yea, that you may conquer Satan,
and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his
work."</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Fifth Smooth Stone -<em>The Gift of the Holy Ghost</em></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></p>
<p>The final smooth stone that David picked up was the stone of the Holy Ghost.  He not
only had faith, was obedient, performed service, and prayed, but he had the Spirit of the Lord
with him.  Because of his faith, obedience, service, and prayer the Spirit of the Lord was with
him.  Remember what President Kimball said:</p>
<p>"...to be the victor, one must follow the path that David followed: "David behaved
himself wisely in all his ways; <strong>and the Lord was with him."</strong></p>
<p>You know as well as I do that the Holy Ghost cannot stay with us and guide us if we are
not "behaving" ourselves wisely.  In order to have the Holy Ghost we need to behave wisely. 
The Willie and Martin handcart company were in desperate need of help.  The call was issued by
Brigham Young to load wagons with supplies and for the strong and able men in Salt Lake City
to begin a rescue mission.  Some heeded that call immediately, some took their time, one didn't
hesitate when he received an unusual call through the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Ephriam Hanks records in his diary: </p>
<p>"  I was down to Provo on a fishing expedition, and felt impressed to go to Salt Lake, but for
what reason I knew not.  On my way there, I stopped over night with Gurney Brown at Draper. 
Being somewhat fatigued after the hard day's journey, I retired to rest early, and as I lay wide
awake in my bed, I heard a voice calling me by name then saying: "The handcart people are in
trouble, and you are wanted; will you go and help them?" ... Without any hesitation I answered,
Yes, I will go.  I then turned over to go to sleep, but had slept only a few minutes when the voice
called a second time, repeating almost the same words as on the first occasion.  My answer was
the same as before.  This was repeated the third time.  I got right out of bed.  Gerney, he got my
team hooked up and Sister Brown fixed me a bite and some food to carry along.  Got to Salt Lake
about daylight, and what should happen but I met a messenger from brother Brigham, on his way
to fetch me...</p>
<p>" Seems since I was a boy that <strong>the Lord has always been wiling to keep in touch with me if
I'd keep in touch with Him</strong>...&quot;  </p>
<p>As he reached Wyoming he&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...ran into the blizzard on South Pass and stayed several nights
with Reddick Allred, who was stationed there with flour. The snow was so deep that a team with
a wagon could not travel through it very well, so Brother Hanks borrowed 'two
animals' from
Brother Allred so that he could ride and have a pack horse and travel through the snow to the
handcart pioneers. He passed Joseph A. Young and Able Garr headed to Salt Lake to report on
the Martin Company and then met the Martin Company as they were leaving Martin's Cove: On
the evening of the second day he records:</p>
<p>" ...as I was making my bed, I thought to myself, how nice it would be to have a buffalo robe to
lie on, and some fresh meat for supper.  I kneeled down and asked the Lord to send me a buffalo. 
Looking around, imagine my surprise when I beheld a big, fat, buffalo bull within fifty yards of
my camp.  As soon as I could get my gun I brought him down with the first shot.  After eating
...to my hearts content, I went to sleep ....Early the next morning I was on my way again, and
soon reached what is known as the Ice Springs Bench. There I happened upon a herd of buffalo,
and killed a nice cow. I was impressed to do this, although I did not know why until a few hours
later, but the thought occurred to my mind that the hand of the Lord was in it, as it was a rare
thing to find buffalo herds around that place at this late part of the season. I skinned and dressed
the cow; then cut up part of its meat in long strips and loaded my horses with it. Thereupon I
resumed my journey, and traveled on till towards evening. I think the sun was about an hour high
in the west when I spied something in the distance that looked like a black streak in the snow. As
I got near to it, I perceived it moved; then I was satisfied that this was the long looked for hand-cart company, led by Captain Edward Martin. I reached the ill-fated train just as the immigrants
were camping for the night. The sight that met my gaze as I entered their camp can never be
erased from my memory. The starved forms and haggard countenances of the poor sufferers, as
they moved about slowly, shivering with cold, to prepare their scanty evening meal was enough
to touch the stoutest heart. When they saw me coming, they hailed me with joy inexpressible, and
when they further beheld the supply of fresh meat I brought into camp, their gratitude knew no
bounds. Flocking around me, one would say, 'Oh, please, give me a small piece of
  meat;'
another would exclaim, 'My poor children are starving, do give me a little;' and children with
tears in their eyes would call out, 'Give me some, give me some.' At first I tried to wait on them
and handed out the meat as they called for it; but finally I told them to help themselves. Five
minutes later both my horses had been released of their extra burden--the meat was all gone, and
the next few hours found the people in camp busily engaged in cooking and eating it, with
thankful hearts.</p>
<p>&quot;A prophecy had been made by one of the brethren that the company should feast
on buffalo meat when their provisions might run short; my arrival in their camp,
loaded with meat, was the beginning of the fulfillment of that prediction; but only
the beginning, as I afterwards shot and killed a number of buffalo for them as we
journeyed along." (<em>Remember</em>, Riverton Wyoming Stake)</p>
<p>In our lives we will meet different kinds of Goliaths that will have different types of
voices and opinions.  Often when a moment of decision comes about we might be confused as to
what to do, or what voice to listen to.  Friends may suggest and often encourage us in our
decisions.  Media publications and advertising may inform, textbooks may offer answers but the
Spirit of the Lord is the most accurate and constant source of direction.  The prophet Jacob of the
Book of Mormon says it best:</p>
<p>To hear the spirit we must be humble.  President Hinckley labeled the need for humility
as his fifth "B":</p>
<p>"There is no place for arrogance in our lives. There is no place for conceit. There
is no place for egotism. <strong>We have a </strong>great work to do. We have things to
accomplish. We need direction in the pursuit of our education. We need help in
choosing an eternal companion.</p>
<p>&quot;The Lord has said, "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the
hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers" (D&amp;C 112:10).</p>
<p>What a tremendous promise is given in this statement. If we are without conceit
and pride and arrogance, if we are humble and obedient, then the Lord will lead us
by the hand and answer our prayers. What greater thing could we ask for? There is
nothing to compare with this." (First Presidency Message A Prophet's Counsel
and Prayer for Youth, January 2001 <em>The Ensign</em>, 2)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Conclusion</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></p>
<p>So my young brothers and sisters there you have the five smooth stones that will assist
you in successfully defeating you personal Goliaths in life.  These stones of 
		<strong>faith, obedience,
service, prayer, </strong>and <strong>the Holy Ghost</strong>, have been proven, tested and tried.  They are smooth
stones.  Centuries after David met Goliath the apostle Paul spoke of the latter days, our time.  He
spoke of our society of you and me.  He said in one of his epistles to Timothy (1 Tim 4:1-2)</p>
<p>And then he explains some of the Goliaths that have conquered many of our day: (2 Tim 3-2-4)</p>
<p>To combat against the latter day Goliaths that we will face, Paul also suggests a form of
armor that may be correlated with the five smooth stones that David used.  In his writings to the
Ephesians Paul identifies the type of Goliath that we will face today:</p>
<p>"...my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.  Put on the
whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
			<strong><em>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
wickedness in high places.</em></strong>  Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God,
that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand." 
(Ephesians 6:10-13)</p>
<p>And then he lists the armor of God:</p>
<p>Let us arm ourselves with the five smooth stones of faith, obedience, service, prayer and
the Holy Ghost.  Let us put on the whole armor of God, hefting the shield of faith, having our
feet shod with the gospel of service to bring peace to all we meet.  Having our loins girded about
with truth and the breastplate of obedience in righteous actions, praying always having the helmet
of salvation to come off conquer and swinging the sword of the Spirit of God is my
prayer.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">I have a special keepsake I often carry with me.  It's a white handkerchief with a
beautiful crocheted edge that was hand made by my Grandmother.  This handkerchief not only
stirs fond memories about my Grandma but also brings to mind the sweet associations I had
with her in her house and the lessons I learned as she passed on a legacy of faith and
commitment to gospel principles, as well as a love for Ricks College.</p>
<p align="left">Let me tell you about my Grandma's house.  Visualize in your mind a little, old, white
house with a screened-in porch, green shutters, and a white picket fence that greets guests as
they enter the front yard.  Picture hollyhocks climbing up the side of the house and huge
bushes loaded with yellow roses blooming in gardens that accent a lush, green lawn.  I can
still smell the fragrance of lilac trees that delineated her property from the neighbors.  My
stomach even aches when I think of eating sour green apples from the field near her home. 
This was my Grandma's house.  Maybe you have memories of your Grandma's house too.  
		</p>
<p align="left">I loved going to visit my Grandma. The inside of this special house was modest.  The
living room was papered with old-timey wallpaper, set off by a flower-patterned carpet.  
Right off the living room was the "middle bedroom" where I loved to sleep.  My Grandma
had the softest bed in the world.  The mattress would envelop you on both sides and coax you
into a peaceful slumber.  I remember the sound of her cuckoo clock as it ticked off the minutes
and hours, the smell of homemade bread coming from her kitchen, and her loving touch as I
would sit by her on the couch.</p>
<p align="left">Grandma always had treats for us when we came to visit.  Her freezer was full of
orange sherbet "Dixie Cups" that we would eat with a flat wooden spoon, savoring every bite.</p>
<p align="left">Her fridge was stocked with our favorite flavors of bottled soda pop.  I even remember a
pewter bowl that was filled with white candy mints with soft green spearmint centers.  They
were so yummy.</p>
<p align="left">I'm sure many of you have similar memories of your Grandmother. 
		</p>
<p align="left">I learned lots of lessons from my Grandmother.  She was always cheerful, even though
she was a widow and lived by herself all of the time I knew her.  She loved serving and
helping others.  Her house was always tidy inside and out.  She didn't even get mad at me
when I told her I had accidentally broken her bedroom window with a softball while I was
playing "Annie I Over" with my cousins.</p>
<p align="left">Grandma always encouraged me to practice the piano.  In fact, one time she promised
to give me ten dollars if I would practice my piano every day all summer.  I must have been
crazy to agree to that much practicing for that little pay, but I did it for Grandma.  I remember
how thrilled I was the day she gave me the ten dollar bill.</p>
<p align="left">Grandma always spoke her mind.  When I was about 15 years old I had gone shopping
for a bathing suit in the city near where she lived.  When I brought the suit to her home and
put it on to model it for her, she looked at me and said with a scorn, "I never thought a
granddaughter of mine would wear a two-piece bathing suit."  Well, that was the first and last
time I wore the suit.  I returned the swimming suit to the store the next day.</p>
<p align="left">My Grandmother passed away in 1972 while I was a student at BYU.  The night of her
funeral I remember lying in bed, reminiscing about Grandma with my cousin who was the
same age.  We had spent many hours together at Grandma's house and felt so blessed by the
precious memories we had of her.</p>
<p align="left">The last day I saw my Grandma's house was the day of her funeral.  The house was
sold after her death, and I didn't return to see her home until 25 years later.  I had shared with
our sons many memories about my Grandmother and her house--some of the things I have
shared with you.  You can imagine my disappointment when I drove past her home to show
our boys this cute old house, only to find that the home wasn't anything like I had described to
them.  Time and lack of care and attention had taken their toll.  Drab, brown paint was peeling
from the exterior of the house; and it seemed to beg for repairs.  Instead of a white picket
fence, there was netted wire.  Huge, tall weeds had replaced the beautiful rose bushes and
flower gardens.  The lush, green, well-manicured lawn had died; and the parched earth
surrounding her home was strewn with trash, junk, and litter.  What I had imagined would be
there had vanished.  All I had were the memories.  With a pit in my stomach I remember
wanting to pound on the door and say, "Don't you know that this is my Grandma's house?"</p>
<p align="left">My Grandma's house has come to mind many times over the past 15 months as Ricks
College has transitioned to Brigham Young University-Idaho and as we take on a new name
and offer baccalaureate degrees.  New employees and faculty have been hired, thousands of
new and returning students have arrived, and I think we are all excited to be the new tenants
of this house.  But as we take occupancy, we must remember that to more than a hundred
thousand alumni this institution has always been known as Ricks College.  Students from the
past have walked the halls of the buildings on this campus, have made eternal friendships, and,
like at my Grandmother's house, have created lasting memories here.  This is the place where
Thomas E. Ricks dedicated a new academy in 1888 which was the forerunner to Ricks
College.  At the dedication he said the academy "was to give spirituality precedence over
worldliness; the principles of the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ were to be taught side by side
with arithmetic, geography, [and] reading . . ." (<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Spirit of Ricks</span>, David L. Crowder,
p.&nbsp;3).  This is the place where the first principal of the academy, Jacob Spori, gave money
from his own pocket to pay the salaries of teachers when the school fell on hard times.  This is
the place where dedicated faculty and employees have given one-by-one attention to students
and friendly smiles and "Hellos" have been exchanged.  Here, on these grounds, tens of
thousands of students have felt the Holy Ghost and learned important lessons about life.  The
memories of this institution are indelibly etched in the hearts of those who have attended and
loved Ricks College.  They have felt the "Spirit of Ricks" on this campus.</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px" align="left">As the new guardians of this institution, will we have a sense of whose house this is?  
Will we come to know, understand, and perpetuate the legacy that is held so dear by so many?
Will we recognize and let blossom our God-given potential and assume the obligation we have
to succeed as we use the sacred tithes of the Church to further our education?  Will the picket
fence of friendly smiles and words of encouragement continue to greet students as they enter
this campus, or will it be replaced with the uninviting wire netting of silent lips and cold
stares?  Will our hands reach out in service and sacrifice for others?  Will we have enough
personal integrity to obey the honor and dress codes that are so vital to preserving the spirit
that is felt here, or will we carelessly allow the paint of these precious hallmark principles to
slowly fade and peel off as time and lack of regard for the guidelines take their toll?  Will we
carefully maintain the righteous sociality that is so unique to this institution; or will we allow
the trash of pornography and sleazy entertainment, the junk of immodesty, and the litter of
self-absorption to clutter the vision of our mission?  Will we continue to cultivate our
testimonies of the gospel of Jesus Christ and qualify by our obedience for the companionship
of the Holy Ghost, or will we trade the garden of spirituality for weeds of worldliness?  Will
we do our part to preserve and enhance the "Spirit of Ricks"; or when alumni come back to
visit with their children and grandchildren will they disappointedly want to pound on the door
and ask, "What have you done to Ricks College?"</p>
<p align="left">I brought my Grandma's handkerchief with me today because it reminds me of an
experience I had in her home the summer I turned seventeen and was deciding where to attend
college.  I still remember sitting in her living room as she asked me if I would consider living
with her and attending Ricks College.  She had always loved this institution since being a
student here in 1910.  And as an added incentive, Grandma said she would let me have her
car.  Well, if you had seen her car you wouldn't have considered that proposition to be any
more of a drawing card than I did, and I chose to go elsewhere to school.</p>
<p align="left">During the past four years as Elder Bednar has served as president of this institution,
I've thought many times how pleased my Grandma is that I've had a Ricks College
experience--though it has certainly come later in my life than she would have anticipated.  I
know that she would expect me to do what I can to help preserve and enhance the spirit on this
campus.</p>
<p align="left">As we celebrate the future, it is my prayer that we will be faithful and true to the
legacy of the past.  May we honor the testimony and sacrifice of those who have gone before
by being our best self, by giving freely of our talents and service, and by living so the "Spirit
of Ricks" will always be present on this campus.  May those who return to BYU<font face="Times New Roman"></font>Idaho in the
years to come be pleased with how we have cared for this special house, in the name of Jesus
Christ, Amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">Brothers and sisters, this has been a most sobering and a most humbling morning for all of us.  Let me begin by reading to you a statement from the First
Presidency that was issued just a short time ago:</p>
<p><i>In this hour of sorrow, the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints expresses profound sympathy to those whose loved ones, friends,
and associates were lost or injured in today's senseless acts of violence. We offer our prayers in behalf of the innocent victims of these vicious attacks. We ask
our Heavenly Father to guide President Bush and his advisors as they respond to these devastating incidents.</i></p>
<p>I would also like to make you aware of the following information concerning missionaries.  
		</p>
<p>As of 12 p.m. Tuesday, the 11th of September, all missionaries in the New York City and Washington, D.C., areas are safely accounted for.  Twenty-one
missionaries left Salt Lake City early this morning headed for New York City.  The plane landed in Denver where they are staying until further notice. Other
missionaries who departed from Salt Lake City early this morning have landed safely within the United States.  All other missionaries scheduled to leave from
Salt Lake City today have returned to the Missionary Training Center until further notice.</p>
<p>There are undoubtedly many within the sound of my voice today who will be grateful to hear that news about the missionaries of the Church.</p>
<p>This morning as I was watching the tragic events unfolding, a scripture came to my mind.  The scripture that came to my mind is the second one that will be
portrayed on the screen above; but before I read the verse, to place it in a proper context, I need to make reference to another verse.  You might want to jot
down the reference for these particular verses.  They are found in section 45 of the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
<p>In verse 26 there is a phrase that simply states: ". . . and the whole earth shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail them . . . ."</p>
<p>That is the context.  The key verse, however, is 32.  Please listen carefully, brothers and sisters:  "But my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be
moved . . . ."</p>
<p>We have received a number of phone calls today in the President's Office:  "Are classes cancelled?"  The answer is no.  "Will devotional continue as planned?" 
The answer is yes.  On this, of all days, we as disciples of the Savior have the opportunity to gather together and stand in holy places.  So it was our
determination to move forward with classes and with the devotional.  Today we are adjusting the format.  We will do some things at the end of our meeting that
will be a little bit different, i.e., we are going to sing two hymns as we conclude today's devotional.  So it is likely the case that we will take a few minutes
longer than is normal. Do not be nervous.  Everything will be fine in your next scheduled class.</p>
<p>This is a time for us as members of the Church to demonstrate faith in the Savior and unity.  It is not a time for fear.  This is a time for us as disciples of the
Savior to be concerned less with public demonstration and more concerned with personal, private devotion.  This is a time for us as disciples of the Savior to
carry on, not to halt nor to pause.</p>
<p>Listen carefully to the words of a hymn:</p>
<p><i>Firm as the mountains around us, Stalwart and brave we stand<br />On the rock our father's planted  For us in the goodly land--<br />The rock of honor and virtue, Of faith in the living God.<br />They raised his banner triumphant -- Over the desert sod.  
			<br /><br />And we hear the desert singing:  Carry on, carry on, carry on!<br />Hills and vales and mountains ringing:  Carry on, carry on, carry on!<br />Holding aloft our colors, We march in the glorious dawn.<br />O youth of the noble birthright, Carry on, carry on, carry on!</i></p>
<p>Thus, brothers and sisters, on this campus, in our classes, in this devotional we will carry on.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">Good afternoon, brothers and sisters, and welcome to Brigham Young University-Idaho.  This is a historic time for all of us who study and serve at this great institution.  Sister
Bednar and I pray that your experience here in Rexburg will be spiritually edifying,
intellectually engaging, and eternally worthwhile.</p>
<p>I am beginning my fifth year of service as the president of this institution.  When Sister
Bednar and I first arrived on campus in 1997, we began inviting students to participate with us
in home evening.  On a typical Monday night we meet with between 80 to 150 students. 
Thus, during the last four years we have listened to, talked with, and learned from
approximately 12,000 students in more than 150 home evenings.  The format is always the
same.  We sing an opening hymn, an invocation is offered, and then Sister Bednar and I do
our best to answer gospel questions asked by the students.  We conclude with a benediction
and lots of ice cream.  Our Monday night visits with you are always one of the highlights of
our week. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Most Frequently Asked Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Sister Bednar and I have learned much about you from your questions.  You are eager
and anxious to learn the doctrines of the restored gospel.  You want direct and forthright
answers to your gospel questions.  And you have earnest desires to appropriately apply correct
principles in your daily lives.  We have also noted a number of recurring concerns and
questions--gospel issues about which you wonder, ponder, and about which you are seeking
additional understanding.  Each week questions about gospel doctrine and principles,
marriage, careers, and church government and procedures are quite typical.  However, one
question is asked over and over and over again, week after week after week.  I will summarize
this most frequently asked question as follows: "<em>How can I tell the difference between my
emotions telling me what I want to hear and the Holy Ghost telling me what I need to hear?"</em></p>
<p>In my September 1999 devotional message, I attempted to provide the beginning of an
answer to this important question.  My purpose today is to build upon and expand my previous
message.</p>
<p>Many of you may be wondering why I would choose to address this particular topic
today.  After all, this is the first devotional of the first fall semester at Brigham Young
University-Idaho.  Given the historic transition that is occurring and this important occasion,
why would the president not discuss the vision of and plans for this church-sponsored
institution of higher education?  Let me suggest two reasons for my approach today.</p>
<p>First, our devotional speaker next week will be Elder Henry B. Eyring of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles.  Elder Eyring also serves as the Commissioner of the Church
Educational System and as a member of the Board of Trustees for Brigham Young University-Idaho.  You will want to be sure to attend that devotional and learn from Elder Eyring next
week.  He will be here on campus presenting a message from the Board about the mission and
purpose and role of BYU-Idaho.  His devotional message will be an important one for all of
us, and it would be premature and presumptuous of me to make extensive comments about the
future and destiny of this institution before the Board has spoken officially.</p>
<p>Let me simply say one thing to you students about the transition that is taking place as
Ricks College becomes Brigham Young University-Idaho.  <strong>These are days never to be
forgotten!</strong>  In the hustle and hectic pace of our daily lives, it may be easy for us to miss the
miracle and the majesty of what is occurring on this campus.  We often look back in Church
history with great admiration and affection to the early years and episodes of Brigham Young
University and of Ricks College.  The pioneers who established these schools prepared a
spiritual and educational pathway upon which generations of students have passed.  In like
manner, you students today are helping to write a new and important chapter in Church
history.  The decision by the Board of Trustees to create Brigham Young University-Idaho
was the result of revelation.  I know and testify of that fact, and you students will live to tell
your children and grandchildren that you were here at BYU-Idaho at a most historic and
important time.</p>
<p>The second reason for my approach today is a simple one.  The transition of Ricks
College to Brigham Young University-Idaho is a powerful and timely example of the principle
I want to discuss with you today.  This principle is described in 2 Nephi 28:30.  Please turn
with me to this verse in the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p><em>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children
of men <strong>line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and
there a little;</strong> and blessed are those who hearken unto my
precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn
wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from
them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken
away even that which they have.  </em>(Emphasis added)</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the theme for my message this afternoon is contained in the phrase</p>
<p>". . . <em>line upon line, precept upon precept </em>. . . ."  If you and I would learn to discern the
difference between our own emotions and the promptings of the Holy Ghost, then we must
come to recognize the Lord's pattern and process for giving us spiritual knowledge.  And the
phrase ". . .&nbsp;<em>line upon line, precept upon precept </em>. . ." describes a central feature of the
Lord's pattern.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">A Faulty Assumption and Erroneous Expectations</span></strong></p>
<p>I believe many of us unknowingly accept a faulty assumption about the Lord's pattern. 
And this faulty assumption then produces erroneous expectations about how we receive
spiritual knowledge.  And that faulty assumption and our misinformed expectations ultimately
hinder our ability to recognize and respond to the promptings of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Let me suggest that many of us typically assume we will receive 
		<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">an</span></strong> answer or 
		<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">a</span></strong>
prompting to our earnest prayers and pleadings.  And we also frequently expect that such 
		<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">an</span></strong>
answer or <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">a</span></strong> prompting will come immediately and 
		<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">all at once</span></strong>.  Thus, we tend to believe the
Lord will give us <strong>A BIG ANSWER QUICKLY AND ALL AT ONE TIME</strong>.  However, the
pattern repeatedly described in the scriptures suggests we receive  ". . .&nbsp;<em>line upon line, precept
upon precept</em> . . .," or in other words, <strong>MANY SMALL ANSWERS OVER A PERIOD OF
TIME</strong>.  Recognizing and understanding this pattern is an important key to obtaining
inspiration and help from the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Now we all acknowledge that receiving a big answer quickly and all at once is possible
and, in fact, does occur in some exceptional circumstances.  Perhaps we give overmuch
emphasis to the miraculous experiences of Joseph in the Sacred Grove, of Paul on the road to
Damascus, and of Alma the Younger.  If our personal experiences fall short of these
well-known and spiritually dramatic examples, then perhaps we believe something is wrong
with or lacking in us.  I am suggesting that the particular spiritual process evidenced in these
three examples with Joseph, Paul, and Alma is more rare than it is routine, more the exception
than the rule.  As President Boyd K. Packer has explained: "I have learned that strong,
impressive spiritual experiences do not come to us very frequently" (<span style="text-decoration: underline">That All May be Edified</span>,
p.&nbsp;337).  Most typically we receive a series of seemingly small and incremental spiritual
impressions and nudges, which in totality constitute the desired confirmation about the
correctness of the path which we are pursuing.  Remember, Nephi tried several different
approaches before he was able to successfully obtain the plates of brass from Laban (see
1&nbsp;Nephi 3-4).  And he did not learn how to build a ship of curious workmanship all at one
time; rather, he was shown by the Lord "from time to time after what manner [he] should
work the timbers of the ship" (1 Nephi&nbsp;17:1).</p>
<p>Please notice the Lord's pattern of providing spiritual knowledge in the following
statement by President Joseph F. Smith.</p>
<p><em>When I as a boy first started out in the ministry, I would
frequently go out and ask the Lord to show me some marvelous
thing, in order that I might receive a testimony.  But the Lord
withheld marvels from me, and showed me the truth, line upon
line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, until he
made me to know the truth from the crown of my head to the
soles of my feet, and until doubt and fear had been absolutely
purged from me.  He did not have to send an angel from the
heavens to do this, nor did he have to speak with the trump of an
archangel.  By the whisperings of the still small voice of the
Spirit of the living God, he gave to me the testimony I possess. 
And by this principle and power he will give to all the children of
men a knowledge of the truth that will stay with them, and it will
make them to know the truth, as God knows it, and to do the will
of the Father as Christ does it.  And no amount of marvelous
manifestations will ever accomplish this.  It is obedience,
humility, and submission to the requirements of heaven and to the
order established in the kingdom of God upon the earth, that will
establish men in the truth.  Men may receive the visitation of
angels; they may speak in tongues; they may heal the sick by the
laying on of hands; they may have visions and dreams; but except
they are faithful and pure in heart, they become an easy prey to
the adversary of their souls, and he will lead them into darkness
and unbelief more easily than others.</em>  (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Gospel Doctrine</span>, p. 7)</p>
<p>It is interesting to note how as a young man President Smith expected a big answer
quickly and all at one time.  Ultimately, however, he received many small answers over an
extended period of time; and thereby his testimony grew ever stronger.</p>
<p>Each of us must also appreciate the roles of faithfulness and diligence and obedience in
the Lord's pattern for receiving help from heaven.  Please turn with me again to
2&nbsp;Nephi&nbsp;28:30.</p>
<p><em>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children
of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and
there a little; <strong>and blessed are those who hearken unto my
precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn
wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; </strong></em>and from
them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken
away even that which they have.  (Emphasis added)</p>
<p>Thus, those who faithfully hearken to and obediently heed the Lord's direction will
learn wisdom and receive more.  As described by Elder Richard G. Scott: "When we receive
help from our Father in Heaven, it is in response to faith, obedience, and the proper use of
agency" (<em>Learning to Recognize Answers to Prayers</em>, Ensign, November 1989, p. 30).</p>
<p>Please note how this principle is both reiterated and amplified in the following verses.<span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p><em>For he will give unto the <strong>faithful</strong> line upon line, precept upon
precept; and <strong>I will try you and prove you herewith.</strong></em><strong></strong>
(D&amp;C&nbsp;98:12; emphasis added)<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If thou shalt ask</em></strong><em>, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation,
knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries
and peaceable things--that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth
life eternal.</em>  (D&amp;C 42:61; emphasis added)</p>
<p><em>And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, yea,
and with commandments not a few, and with revelations <strong>in their
time</strong>--<strong>they that are faithful and diligent </strong>before me.  
			</em>(D&amp;C 59:4;
emphasis added)</p>
<p><em>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light,
			<strong>and
continueth in God</strong>, receiveth more light; and that light groweth
brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</em>  (D&amp;C 50:24;
emphasis added)</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, if you and I would distinguish our personal emotions from the
impressions placed in our hearts and minds by the Holy Ghost, then we must desire and seek,
ask and discern, hear and obey, and then again desire and seek and ask and discern and hear
and obey.  Our faith and diligence and obedience are ongoing invitations for additional
spiritual knowledge and insight.  Faith leads to obedience which yields wisdom and an even
greater desire for added light and truth.</p>
<p>The process of discerning between our will and God's will becomes less and less of a
concern as time goes by and as we strive to rid ourselves of worldliness--and thereby cultivate
the spirit of revelation in our lives.  That is, as we mature spiritually, we begin to develop
sound judgment, a refined and educated conscience, and a heart and mind filled with wisdom. 
It is not just that we have grown older, nor have we simply become smarter and had more
experiences on which to draw, as important as those experiences are.  Rather, the Holy Ghost
has over time been expanding our intellect, forming our feelings, sharpening and elevating our
perspective, such that we increasingly think and feel and act as the Lord would under similar
circumstances.  In short, we have made steady progress in obtaining "the mind of Christ"
(1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:16).</p>
<p>This ongoing cycle of gaining spiritual knowledge ultimately produces a precious and
delicious fruit, but that fruit cannot and does not grow from a blossom to its ripened state
overnight.  Furthermore, such fruit cannot grow in barren soil.  Obedience to God's
commandments and our personal integrity and adherence to commitments such as the honor
and dress codes at BYU-Idaho provide the needed nutrients for fertile spiritual soil.  It should
be obvious to all of us that evil influences such as filthy language, immodest clothing and
appearance, and pornography are bitter poisons that kill the soil and halt the spiritually subtle
process of receiving help from heaven ". . .&nbsp;<em>line upon line, precept upon precept 
		</em>. . . ."  
There can be no shortcut around the law of the harvest; truly, we reap what we sow
(Galatians&nbsp;6:7).</p>
<p><strong>Illustrations and Implications</strong></p>
<p>Both the history of the Church and our personal lives are replete with examples of the
Lord's pattern for obtaining spiritual knowledge  ". . .&nbsp;<em>line upon line, precept upon
precept&nbsp;</em>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."  For example, the fundamental doctrines and principles of the restored gospel
were not delivered to the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove in a neatly organized
binder.  Rather, these priceless treasures were revealed line upon line as circumstances
warranted and as the timing was right.  As Elder Neal A. Maxwell has indicated,</p>
<p><em>Though the absence of vital gospel truths began to be remedied
by the Restoration, appreciation and understanding were neither
widespread nor immediate among all Church members.
Sequentially, though it was not then fully recognized by all, the
precious truths concerning premortality were unfolded in
accordance with the line-upon-line pattern of revelation.  These
came first in April or May 1829 (Alma 13), and then with much
more clarity and detail in 1830, while Joseph was translating
Genesis and received the book of Moses by revelation.  More
came in 1832 (D&amp;C 76:11-13), in 1833 (D&amp;C 93), and so on.
Still more came in 1842 when the book of Abraham was
published.  Joseph Smith publicly preached a portion of the
doctrine of premortality in 1839 (see <span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings</span>, p. 158).  Later,
just prior to his martyrdom, there came the soaring King Follett
funeral sermon in April 1844 (see <span style="text-decoration: underline">Teachings</span>, beginning p. 343).
Most recently, in 1918, we received what is now section 138 of
the Doctrine and Covenants.</em>  (<span style="text-decoration: underline">A Wonderful Flood of Light</span>,
pp.&nbsp;41-42).</p>
<p>Another episode from Church history described by Elder Maxwell also illustrates the
Lord's pattern.</p>
<p><em>Meekness is so necessary as to our readiness to learn not only
these sweeping truths but particular truths as well, which come
incrementally, "line upon line, precept upon precept"
(D&amp;C&nbsp;98:12).  The Prophet Joseph Smith, for instance, first
translated the thirteenth chapter of First Nephi in perhaps late
1828 or the spring of 1829.  These verses note that certain things
had been "kept back" and "taken away."  In June 1830, Joseph
received the "precious morsel" we know as the first chapter of
Moses.  Therein Moses was told by the Lord that of the scriptures
Moses would write, certain individuals would "take many of them
from the book" (Moses 1:41).  It was not until February 16,
1832, however, after a conference in Amherst, Ohio, that Joseph
said it was apparent to him, "from sundry revelations which had
been received," that "many important points touching the
salvation of man had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it
was compiled" (Preface to D&amp;C 76).  On that date, among other
things, came the sunburst of celestial truths about the three
degrees of glory.</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline">(Meek and Lowly</span>, p.&nbsp;73)</p>
<p>I want to highlight one last example from the history of the restored Church.  President
Joseph Fielding Smith taught the following principle.</p>
<p><em>This work of salvation for the dead came to the Prophet like every
other doctrine--piecemeal.  It was not revealed all at once.  When
the Angel Moroni came to the Prophet Joseph Smith, one of the
things he told him was that the hearts of the children should turn
to their fathers and the hearts of the fathers to the children, so
that when the Lord should come the earth should not be smitten
with a curse.  That is significant.  That was the first inkling the
Prophet had concerning salvation for the dead, and he did not
know just what it meant.  He had a very vague idea of the
meaning of the words that Elijah would come to "plant in the
hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers," and I
suppose he pondered over it a good deal.</em>  (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Doctrines of
Salvation</span>, Vol. 2, p.&nbsp;168)</p>
<p>That first small inkling given to the Prophet Joseph grew line upon line and precept
upon precept--and eventually included the restoration of priesthood keys in the Kirtland
Temple, the performance of essential ordinances in the Nauvoo Temple, and the availability of
more than 110 temples throughout the world today.  Truly progress has been made in this
eternally important work--line upon line and precept upon precept.</p>
<p>I could recount many more examples from Church history about the Lord's pattern. 
However, I now want to highlight some personal examples with which I hope all of us can
relate.</p>
<p>Sister Bednar and I frequently visit with students who wonder about career choices and
how to properly select a school at which to study and receive additional education.  Many
times a student is perplexed--having felt as though "the" answer about a career or a school was
received at one particular point in time, only to feel that a different and perhaps conflicting
answer was received at another point in time.  The question then is often asked, "Why did the
Lord give me two different answers?"  In like manner, a student may sincerely seek to know if
the person he or she has been dating is "the one."  A feeling of "yes" at one time may appear
to be contradicted by a different feeling of "no" at another time.  May I simply suggest that
what we initially believe is "the" answer may be but one part of a  ". . .&nbsp;<em>line upon line,
precept upon precept </em>. . ." ongoing, incremental, and unfolding pattern of small answers.  It is
clearly the case that the Lord did not change His mind; rather, you and I must learn to better
recognize the Lord's pattern as a series of related and expanding answers to our most
important questions.</p>
<p>Sister Bednar and I knew each other for 19 months and dated for 15 months before we
were married.  I do not recall ever receiving a single, overwhelming spiritual confirmation that
she was "the one."  I do recall that as we dated, as we talked, as we became better acquainted,
and as we observed and learned about each other in a variety of circumstances, I received
many small, simple, and quiet reassurances that she was indeed a remarkable and spiritual
woman.  All of those simple answers over a period of time led to and produced an appropriate
spiritual reassurance that indeed we were to be married.  That reassurance did not come all at
once; rather, it was spiritually subtle and gradually distilled upon our minds as the dews from
heaven, as described in the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
<p>Now please understand that I am not trying to suggest the experience Sister Bednar and
I had is precisely what will or should happen to you.  I am suggesting that we should not feel
spiritually inadequate or unqualified if we do not receive a big and immediate answer to a
request or plea for help the first time we ask.  And we will be better served spiritually by
studying and understanding the Lord's pattern of revealing things to us  ". . .
		<em>line upon line,
precept upon precept </em>. . . ." </p>
<p>A final statement by Elder Maxwell summarizes the importance of learning and
applying the Lord's pattern in our lives.</p>
<p><em>Paced progress not only is acceptable to the Lord but also is
recommended by Him.  Divine declarations say: "Ye are little
children and ye cannot bear all things now" (D&amp;C 50:40); "I will
lead you along" (D&amp;C 78:18).  Just as divine disclosure usually
occurs line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and
there a little, so likewise we will achieve our spiritual progress
gradually (see D&amp;C 128:21; 98:12). </em>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">Men and Women of
Christ</span>, p. 23)</p>
<p>I felt impressed to talk about the Lord's pattern today because that is exactly how
Brigham Young University-Idaho is becoming Brigham Young University-Idaho.  As the
announcement about the future of this institution was made by President Hinckley in June of
2000, there was no extensive strategic plan already in place for the transition.  The Board
established the basic guidelines and parameters, but the programmatic details have come 
".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little</em> . . ." during the last
14 months.  And those details continue to come.  I have been blessed to be a participant in and
a witness of that process.  And I testify that the Lord's pattern is in operation and is true.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, if you and I have communicated successfully this afternoon, then
we should be able to discern more clearly the consistent help from heaven we have received in
our lives in the past.  And our faith in the Savior should be stronger and our hope for the
future should be brighter.  We should leave this auditorium this afternoon with a little bit more
confidence that we can recognize the Lord's pattern and process for giving us spiritual
knowledge.</p>
<p>The principles I have discussed with you today are true.  I have come to know the
reality of the Restoration the same way most of you have come to know--line upon line and
precept upon precept.  I know that God lives; I testify and witness that Jesus is the Christ, the
Only Begotten Son of the Eternal Father.  And I know that the Holy Ghost is a revelator and
the testator of all truth.  I further testify that the fullness of the gospel has been restored to the
earth in these latter days.  President Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord's anointed spokesman on
the earth today.  Of these things I testify, and of these things I declare my witness in the name
of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p>	I've had several young women come up to me this past week and tell me how excited
they were about coming tonight, and I told them I was excited too.  I just hope that now you
know the subject of this fireside you are still excited to be here and are glad you came.  </p>
<p>	As many of you know, we have three college-aged sons; so I know a lot about boys.  I
know how they can put down a bag of potato chips in about ten seconds flat.  I know when
they go away to college they wash their sheets once a semester.  I've come to know what the
phrase "It's a guy thing" means.  I've been outvoted four-to-one on almost every event choice. 
When the choice is between watching a "chick flick" or Sports Center, we watch Sports
Center.  Because I'm so accommodating, I've affectionately been designated an honorary
member of the "Bednar Boys Club."  I love our sons.  But in the secret desires of my heart, I
have always wished for a daughter.  And now I have thousands of them.  As I look over this
congregation tonight, I feel so blessed to be here, thankful for the opportunity I have to serve
with my husband at BYU-Idaho and be with you beautiful young women.</p>
<p> 	I hope you young women know that I've sought inspiration for several months about
the subject of tonight's fireside.  I'm here at the invitation of concerned ward and stake
priesthood leaders and Relief Society presidencies and advisers who have sensed a need in
their wards and stakes and have asked me to come and address that need.  After prayerful
consideration, I accepted this assignment because I feel I'm in a unique position to help you
young women see some things from perhaps a different perspective.  First, I'm a mother and I
care deeply about each one of you.  I want you young women to know I truly do love you. 
Second, I'm the wife of a university president and have a great responsibility to assist our</p>
<p>campus wards and stakes to preserve the spirit that exists here.  And third, as the mother of
college-aged sons who are worthy priesthood holders, I feel I have a special perspective about
how your modesty as young women has a powerful influence on the men on this campus.</p>
<p>	I desire for the Holy Ghost to be here with us tonight.  I've prayed earnestly to be an
instrument in the hands of the Lord.  Will each of you have a prayer in your heart tonight for
me and for you that we may be taught by the Holy Spirit and be edified together?</p>
<p><strong>THE PRINCIPLE OF MODESTY IS TIMELESS</strong></p>
<p>	To continue our topic of discussion, I'd like to refer to three quotes by different
prophets.  While I'm reading the quotes that will be projected on the screen, I'd like you to
guess in your minds the prophet who said them and the year in which they were said.</p>
<p>	Quote No. 1 -- Speaking in a session of October general conference, this prophet said:</p>
<p>		. . . I have another matter that weighs upon my mind . . . with respect to
the women, and more particularly with regard to the manner in which they
dress.  Never, perhaps, at least within the period of my life--and I have lived in
the world nearly seventy-five years--never, I say within the period of my life and
experience have I seen such obscene, uncleanly, impure, and suggestive
fashions of women's dress as I see today.  Some of them are abominable.  I lift
my voice against these audacious practices and these infamous fashions . . .
(Joseph F. Smith, October Conference, 1913, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Life of Joseph F. Smith</span>, p. 405).</p>
<p>	Who was it?  When did he say it?  Sounds like President Hinckley could have said this
today, doesn't it?</p>
<p>	Quote No. 2 -- Listen to the words of another prophet in general conference:</p>
<p>		I am ashamed, as I walk the streets of our cities, at the lack of modesty
in the dresses, not only of our young people, but our mothers and even
grandmothers.  I will rejoice when there shall come over this land again an
increased respect for the sacredness of the body and a willingness on the part of
our good, pure, upright ladies to dress themselves in a more becoming manner
(Heber J. Grant, Conference Report, April 1926, p. 8).</p>
<p>	Who was the prophet?  What was the year?</p>
<p>	Quote No. 3:</p>
<p>		Be modest.  Modesty in dress and language and deportment is a true mark of
refinement and a hallmark of a virtuous Latter-day Saint woman.  Shun the low and
vulgar and the suggestive (Ezra T. Benson, "To the Young Women of the Church,"
Ensign 16 [November 1986]: 83).</p>
<p>	Who was the prophet who said this?  When did he say it?</p>
<p>	As you can see, issues regarding modesty and dress and grooming have been on the
minds of prophets for a long time.  In fact, if you stop to think about it, modesty kind of
started with Adam and Eve when they discovered they were naked in the Garden of Eden and
covered themselves!  We seem to need constant reminders that we should treat our bodies as
temples of God.  We speak often about magnifying the priesthood; tonight we will talk about
"reverencing womanhood."    <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RECEIVING COUNSEL AND ACCEPTING CORRECTION</strong></p>
<p>	I realize some of you don't need to hear the message I will present tonight because you
already dress modestly and don't need a reminder.  But, after observing the dress on our
campus the past two weeks since school began, I am convinced that many young women on
our campus <strong>do</strong> need to hear this message.  My question is, "How will it be received?"  Sadly,
some who may benefit from this message aren't here tonight; and there will be others who do
need the reminder who will be offended and may go home thinking I'm a self-righteous, pious
old "fuddy-duddy."  But I'm willing to take the chance that you may think this in hopes that
tonight I might touch the heart of just one young woman.</p>
<p>	The outcome I am hoping for this evening can be explained through relating a personal
experience I had on our campus a year or so ago.  Though this experience is not about
modesty, the principle still relates.  It's a principle about humility and a willingness to take
correction.  </p>
<p>	For many weeks I observed a group of noisy, disruptive students sitting high up in the
bleachers of the Hart Auditorium during our devotional services.  Week after week they came
to socialize and kept bothering other students around them.  Finally, at the encouragement of
my husband, I mustered the courage to climb up the stairs and speak with them one day after
devotional.  My heart was pounding when I got to the top of the stairs because I wasn't sure
what I was going to say.  I expressed my love for these students and then asked why they
bothered to come to devotional when all they wanted to do was talk.  I suggested if they didn't
intend to pay attention, they should stay home.  Devotionals are a worship hour, not a social
hour.  Surprisingly, the students were very polite and respectful and thanked me for the
reminder.  The next week when I looked up in their direction, they waved at me and then
folded their arms.  When Elder&nbsp;Haight visited our campus a few weeks later, they dressed in
their Sunday best for his visit.  After the last devotional of the semester, these students
approached the stand and gave me a hug and a homemade greeting card with their pictures and
a note that said, "Sister Bednar, thank you for reminding us to act like young adults when we
were behaving like Primary children."</p>
<p>	I appreciated the humility of these students and their willingness to be corrected.  The
experience turned out as well for them as it did for me.  We were all edified by what
happened.  In his fireside address last Sunday night, President Hinckley made a comment
similar to this.  He said, "Wise is the man who can acknowledge mistakes pointed out by
others and change his course."  These students were wise.  And as we spend some time
tonight talking about course corrections, I hope we will have eyes to see and ears to hear and
resolve to improve, for we are daughters of our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>	I want to warn you that I intend to be blunt in our discussion tonight.  I hope my
candor and frankness isn't offensive to anyone.  I was talking recently with a male employee
on our campus after he and other adults with whom he works had discussed with student
employees expectations for how they should dress for a campus job.  The adults thought the
students understood.  But within a few days a young woman was sent home to change her
clothes because she was dressed immodestly.  This employee's advice to me was:  "Don't beat
around the bush about modesty.  Be specific."</p>
<p><strong>REVERENCING WOMANHOOD AND THE PRINCIPLE OF MODESTY</strong></p>
<p>	The Encyclopedia of Mormonism defines modesty as:  "A quality of mind, heart, and
body, modesty is an attitude of humility, decency, and propriety that may be evidenced in
thought, language, dress, and behavior (Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Vol. 2, MODESTY).</p>
<p>	Can we see how all encompassing this principle is?  It's mind, heart, body, thought,
language, dress, behavior.  Modesty is truly the hallmark of who we are.  <strong></strong></p>
<p>	Under the heading of DRESS AND APPEARANCE in the pamphlet <em>For the Strength
of Youth</em>, we read:</p>
<p>		Servants of God have always counseled his children to dress modestly to
show respect for him and for themselves.  Because the way you dress sends
messages about yourself to others and often influences the way you and others
act, you should dress in such a way as to bring out the best in yourself and
those around you.</p>
<p>	Let me tell you of an embarrassing experience I had when I was your age and a student
at Brigham Young University.  I was wearing a tight turtle neck similar to most of the turtle
necks and tight shirts I see you young women wearing.  I'd gone into the 7-Eleven store to
buy something to eat when I heard two sleazy boys make some extremely vulgar comments
about me.  The way we dress does send a message, and I sent a message I didn't intend to
boys I didn't have any desire to date, much less associate with.  I felt violated by their
comments; I felt dirty and cheap.  Inside I just wanted to say, "I'm not that kind of a girl." 
But the top I was wearing didn't reflect that.  I never wore that top or anything tight like it
again.  I want to warn you, many of you are sending the wrong message about who you are by
the tight tops you wear.</p>
<p>	As you may know, Elder Bednar and I sometimes go tracting on Sundays.  We spend a
few hours knocking on doors and visiting with students in their apartments.  One afternoon we
caught a glimpse of a young woman in a bikini top who disappeared quickly when she saw us. 
Another young woman who invited us into her apartment felt so uncomfortable by the way she
was dressed that eventually all the decorative pillows from the couch on which she was sitting
ended up on top of her as she tried to cover up her immodest clothing.</p>
<p>	I talked with a father who is serving as a priesthood leader on campus.  Recently when
he went to pick up his daughter at her apartment complex, he was disappointed to find two
girls with navel rings sunbathing in their bikinis.  Young women, what kind of a message are
we trying to send?</p>
<p>	We frequently have important visitors to our campus and off-campus areas.  Let's dress
in such a way that we bring out the best in ourselves and those around us and so we don't send
the wrong message and won't ever be embarrassed if we run into a Church leader
unexpectedly.</p>
<p>	This isn't only about modesty; it's about reverencing womanhood.</p>
<p>	More than 71 years ago Elder Melvin J. Ballard said:</p>
<p>		The most precious thing that a girl has is her modesty and if she
preserves this in dress, in speech, in action, it will arm, and protect her as
nothing else will.  But let her lose her modesty, and she becomes a victim of
those who pursue her, as the hare is of the hound; and she will not be able to
stand unless she preserves her modesty (Melvin J. Ballard, Conference Report,
April, 1929, p. 68).</p>
<p>	Let me share an experience I had not long ago at the minor league baseball field in
Idaho Falls.</p>
<p>	Our family was sitting in the grandstands at the baseball field when a group of men
who had been drinking came and sat in front of us.  Not long after these men sat down, two
pretty young girls with cute figures wearing tight tops and short shorts walked in front of the
grandstands not far from where these men were sitting.  I listened to these vulgar men verbally
and visually undress these young women in their minds as these girls walked by.  It was
disgusting.  These girls would have been so embarrassed if they had heard the way these men
discussed their anatomy.  Shortly after this incident, our family got up and left the game.</p>
<p>	What was hard for me about this situation is that these young women could have been
BYU-Idaho co-eds.  They looked just as innocent as you girls look, and they weren't dressed
any different than I see many of you dress when you are in your apartments and off campus. 
But you need to know that when you leave the protected environment of this special place, you
are asking for trouble if you don't dress modestly.  You will "become the victim of those who
pursue you, as the hare is of the hound" if you don't take a stand on modesty.  Please, let's all
remember the motto from Young Women and also the words of the Relief Society Declaration,
"Stand for truth and righteousness."</p>
<p>	This is about reverencing our womanhood.</p>
<p>	In the priesthood session of general conference in April 2000, Elder Scott was speaking
to the young men about honoring womanhood.  He told the young priesthood holders in
attendance:</p>
<p>		Many [young women] dress and act immodestly because they are told
that is what you want.  In sensitive ways, communicate how distasteful
revealing attire is to you, as a worthy young man, and how it stimulates
unwanted emotions from what you see against your will" (Elder Richard G.
Scott, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, May 2000, 36-37).</p>
<p>	I'm reminded of an experience our son had when he asked a young woman to attend
the senior prom with him.  He had dated this young woman once before and felt
uncomfortable because of what she wore.  But after he mustered the courage to ask her again,
he sheepishly added, "And by the way, please wear some clothes!"  I don't know that our son
was very sensitive in the way he communicated, but this young woman honored his request
and wore a modest formal that made him feel at ease on his date with her that evening.</p>
<p>	Nearly a year ago a young man on our campus affiliated with the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Scroll</span> attempted to
express his feelings about immodest dress.  In quoting selected portions of his article entitled
"Epidermis exposure is too common," this young man wrote:  </p>
<p>		Many young women at Ricks College are showing too much skin. 
Every day I see at least one girl sitting somewhere with a substantial part of her
lower back exposed.  It has become way too common of an occurrence.  It is
thoughtless, inappropriate, and embarrassing.  Any time that I see such an
occurrence, I cannot help but think how ignorant these young women are.
Exposed skin and immodest clothing can introduce thoughts into a person's
mind that would have never existed otherwise.  Such thoughts can be
overpowering and lead to improper and immoral actions.  Good people can
stumble because of seemingly small situations (John Wilson, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Scroll</span>, "Epidermis
exposure is too common," November 7, 2000).</p>
<p>	The content of this letter caused an outrage on our campus.  The <span style="text-decoration: underline">Scroll</span> was filled with
spirited debate on the issue.  Letters from men and women who were angry at this young man
for expressing his opinion, as well as letters supporting his point of view, filled the Mailbox
section of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Scroll</span> for many weeks.  I have to admit, ladies, that the wording of this editorial
probably wasn't all that smooth and caused some misunderstanding.  But I read this piece as a
cry for help from the men on this campus for you girls to wear appropriate clothing.</p>
<p>	Let me read the thoughts of Emily Eyring Robertson, a former student body officer at
Ricks College who is now married and attending BYU.  She is looking at the problems of
immodesty and pornography from a newfound perspective--as a wife.  I have permission to
read a portion of a letter she wrote.</p>
<p>		Rather than being disappointed or confused by girls who dress
immodestly in spite of the Honor Code, I find myself getting angry at them. 
They subject my husband, other women's husbands, and men in general who
are trying to stay clean, to seeing more than they want to of something that is
naturally hard for them to avoid.  When they do so, they contribute to the
breakup of marriages and families.  It seems like a drastic conclusion, but that's
what it comes down to, not to mention the dreadful effect it has on the girls
themselves.</p>
<p>		It just makes me sick at heart to think of my brothers, friends, and all the men I
interact with having to fight such a terrible temptation.  I want to do all I can to fight
it, and I think everyone should (Emily Eyring Robertson, used by permission).</p>
<p>	This is an issue that goes both ways.  Young women, you have a responsibility not to
invite unwanted thoughts into the mind of a young man by the way you dress; and, obviously,
a young man has the responsibility not to dwell or act on those thoughts.  Please, let us
magnify the priesthood by reverencing womanhood.</p>
<p>	I've thought of my own college-aged sons the past two weeks since school began as
I've seen young woman after young woman dressed immodestly.  You can't believe all the
female students I've walked past who were sitting in a chair, and when I looked down I could
see their bikini underpants or <span style="text-decoration: underline">even worse</span>.  I think you know what I mean.  I'm sorry to be so
blunt.  I'm just telling you what I saw.  When I looked into the faces of these girls, I could tell
they probably weren't even aware of what they were showing.  But young women, for the
sake of the priesthood holders on this campus, you cannot continue to be unaware.</p>
<p>	These past few weeks I've been shocked by all the low-rise jeans, short tops, and
navels I have seen on campus.  Ladies, your pants just barely cover the private areas of your
bodies.  They are so revealing.  You can't tell me that girls who wear this type of clothing
don't know what they are showing because they can see it when they look in the mirror.</p>
<p>	For more than a year now, I've been so disappointed by all the tight-fitting, low-cut
tops I've seen.  I want you young women to know that you are revealing much more than you
intend to.  Some of the tops you wear show every bump and every curve on your breast.  They
fit you like a wet swimming suit with no padding, and they are showing every bit as much.</p>
<p>	I know I've been frank, but this is the kind of dress I am seeing on this campus, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">it
shouldn't be here</span>.  When a young man walks into a movie that's inappropriate, he can get up
and leave.  When he sees something unsuitable on the television channel, he can change the
channel or turn off the TV.  But when he has to sit behind or by the side of a young woman
who is dressed immodestly in a class, there isn't a whole lot he can do.  And a young man on
this campus shouldn't have to "hum his favorite hymn" all day to chase out thoughts that he
didn't intentionally invite, especially on a campus where we have all agreed that we will obey
an honor and dress code by being chaste and virtuous and adhering to the guidelines in the
pamphlet <em>For the Strength of Youth</em>.</p>
<p>	A few months ago I was sitting on the stand in this building when I counted the girls on
the front row who were wearing dresses for devotional, and then I noted how many of them
were sitting modestly.  There were just a few.  Now you might say, "Sister Bednar, come on,
lighten up.  They wore dresses.  Give them a break."  But girls, when you wear a dress, you
need to sit with your legs together, close together.  When you are sitting up in the bleachers,
put your feet down in front of you, not up on the next bleacher; you'd be amazed at what you
can see.  You need to make sure that when you cross your legs your dress isn't so short that
you can see to high heaven!  I felt sorry for the priesthood leaders on the stand with me that
day because of what those girls revealed.  You would have been embarrassed, too.  You can
wear a modest dress and still be immodest by the way you sit.</p>
<p>	Elder Bruce R. McConkie has said: </p>
<p>		Modesty in dress is one of the identifying characteristics of saints.  It is
an aid in preserving chastity and an outward sign that the modest person is
imbued with humility, decency, and propriety.  Immodesty in dress is worldly,
excites passions and lusts, places undue emphasis on sex and lewdness, and
frequently encourages and invites petting and other immoral practices.  It is an
outward sign that the immodest person has become hardened to the finer
sensitivities of the Spirit and been overcome by a spirit of vanity and pride
(Elder Bruce R. McConkie, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Mormon Doctrine</span>, p.&nbsp;510).</p>
<p>	The creeping immodesty on our campus reminds me of a story I read once about some
frogs who were boiled alive in a cauldron of water without any resistance.  You see, they were
put into a pot of water when the water was just lukewarm.  Gradually and almost
imperceptibly, the temperature of the water in the pot was raised slowly.  It got hotter and
hotter without the frogs realizing what had happened.  They accommodated themselves in their
new environment until it was too late (see <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, April 1996, 4).</p>
<p>	Ladies, it's time for us to stop accommodating an environment of immodesty and jump
out of the water before we get boiled alive by the seductive and evil influences that are a result
of continued immodest dress.  This is about reverencing our womanhood.</p>
<p>	President Ezra Taft Benson made a blunt statement about immodest dress when he said:
"Keep your dress modest.  Short skirts are not pleasing to the Lord, but modesty is.  Girls, do
not be an enticement for your downfall because of your immodest and tight-fitting clothes"
(Ezra T. Benson, Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, p. 562).</p>
<p>	When I am choosing my wardrobe, this is what I try to do; maybe these guidelines can
help you.  I stand in front of a mirror and carefully scrutinize what I am wearing.  I sit down
in front of the mirror.  I cross my legs in front of the mirror.  I bend over; I lift my arms in
front of the mirror.  And you have the added luxury of asking your roommates what they can
see if you choose to try this suggestion.  I'm sure none of us are seeing ourselves as being
immodest when, in fact, we really are.</p>
<p>	We need to reverence our womanhood.</p>
<p>	Elder Hugh B. Brown has stated: "Young ladies, being ladies you must constantly wear
the hallmark of modesty.  No decent man admires an immodest woman" (Hugh B. Brown,
<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Abundant Life</span>, p. 61).</p>
<p>	Last year my husband and I attended a fast and testimony meeting where a young
woman stood to bear her testimony, profess her love for the Savior, and her desire for a
temple marriage in a terribly immodest and inappropriate outfit.  The skirt hung down around
her hips; and the top she wore was not only tight, but short--it didn't meet the top of her skirt. 
Every time she moved, she revealed her bare back or her stomach.  In my judgment, this is
the height of hypocrisy.  If we love the Savior, we will follow the counsel of his leaders to
dress modestly.  If we desire a temple marriage, we will dress so as to qualify for that
blessing.</p>
<p>	Now, I know the desire of each young woman in this room is to someday find "Prince
Charming."  Let me share a story of romance that I believe relates to modesty.  I know of a
returned missionary who was dating a special young woman.  This young man cared for the
young woman very much and was thinking about making his relationship with her a bit more
serious; in the back of his mind he was thinking about marriage.  It was during this time that
President Hinckley counseled the Relief Society sisters by reading a statement from the First
Presidency asking the women of the Church to wear only one earring in each ear.  This young
man waited patiently for several weeks for the young woman to remove her extra earrings, but
she didn't take them out.  Her message of noncompliance to a prophet's pleading was a
valuable piece of information for this young man.  He finally stopped dating the young woman
because he was looking for a girl who had the courage to follow the prophet.  "No decent man
admires an immodest woman."  I said this at the beginning, but let me reiterate it again.  As a
mother of sons, I want you young women to realize the positive influence for good you can
have on the life of a young man when you incorporate principles of modesty in your life.</p>
<p>	Elder Scott has said:</p>
<p>		Satan has unleashed a seductive campaign to undermine the sanctity of
womanhood, to deceive the daughters of God and divert them from their divine
destiny.  He well knows women are the compassionate, self-sacrificing, loving power
that binds together the human family.  He would focus their interests solely on their
physical attributes and rob them of their exalting roles as wives and mothers (Elder
Richard G. Scott, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, May 2000, p. 36).</p>
<p>	We live in an evil world.  Satan is alive and well in the fashion industry.  I clipped an
Associated Press article from the newspaper a couple of weeks before school started where a
mother described the fashions available for fall this way:</p>
<p>		I see midriffs, shirts with necklines way too low, and all those leopard
fabrics . . . .  They look like they're for lounge singers.  Whether you go to
K-Mart or an expensive department store, all I see are risque outfits.</p>
<p>	Girls, you're being used--used by the fashion industry to make money.  They don't care
what kind of clothing they sell to you or what part of your body you reveal.  I went to the mall
in Salt Lake City this past spring to look at Easter dresses.  I was appalled to find that the
dresses being marketed for pre-teens had thin shoulder straps and looked like evening gowns
rather than Easter dresses for young, innocent little girls.  The standards of the world are
creeping lower and lower and are being targeted toward children who are younger and
younger.  Some day the little girls who are the innocent victims of the clothing industry may
be yours.  Learn now to reverence your womanhood so you can teach the principle of modesty
to your own daughters.</p>
<p>	When I was a student at Brigham Young University, President Harold B. Lee made this
statement:</p>
<p>		Do not underestimate the important symbolic and actual effect of
appearance.  Persons who are well groomed and modestly dressed invite the
companionship of the Spirit of our Father in Heaven and are able to exercise a
wholesome influence upon those around them (President Harold B. Lee, "Be
Loyal to the Royal Within You").</p>
<p>	You can have a positive influence on the people around you.  The April 28, 2001,
edition of the Church News tells of a Young Women group from Kansas City who became
frustrated by the immodest fashions being marketed by retailers to teenagers in their area. 
They expressed their concerns to Nordstroms and were invited by the store to make a
presentation to store managers.  The managers were sympathetic and expressed a desire to
help these young women.  Their courageous story appeared in the Kansas City Star, was
picked up by the wire service and printed in the Wall Street Journal, and also resulted in an
interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation.  These young women have received
e-mails from sympathizers all over the world.  They are in the process of gathering 250,000
signatures in support of their cause for modest clothing.  If you want to help them, their
Internet address is www.goodworks.net.</p>
<p><strong>MODESTY AND THE COMPANIONSHIP OF THE HOLY GHOST</strong></p>
<p>	The bottom line to what we have talked about this evening is this:  If we desire the
companionship of the Holy Ghost, we must invite it by dressing modestly.  If we desire a
temple marriage, we must prepare now by dressing modestly.  If we truly consider our body
to be a temple of God, we must show our appreciation for this precious gift by dressing
modestly.  If we desire to honor the priesthood of God and those who hold that priesthood, we
must dress modestly.  And though we have discussed mostly outward appearance tonight, we
need to remember that modesty encompasses much, much more.  It involves the mind, the
body, the heart, thought, language, dress, and behavior.  It is an identifying characteristic of
who we are.  Modesty is truly about reverencing womanhood.</p>
<p>	May I end tonight with a quote by President Gordon B. Hinckley?</p>
<p>		Of all the creations of the Almighty, there is none more beautiful, none
more inspiring than a lovely daughter of God who walks in virtue with an
understanding of why she should do so, who honors and respects her body as a
thing sacred and divine, who cultivates her mind and constantly enlarges the
horizon of her understanding, who nurtures her spirit with everlasting truth
(President Gordon B. Hinckley, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, September 1988, p. 11).</p>
<p>	Sisters, what we have talked about tonight is true.  I bear my witness of the importance
of the principle of modesty.  May our dress, our thoughts, our actions reflect that we
understand who we truly are&quot;a lovely daughter of God who walks in virtue," in the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
<p>President Henry B. Eyring was named First Counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on February 3, 2008. Previously, he had served as Second Counselor in the First Presidency to President Gordon B. Hinckley since October 6, 2007. He was named to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 1, 1995, having previously served as a member of the Seventy since October 3, 1992.<br /><br />President Eyring previously served as First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric from April 1985 to September 1992 and as Church Commissioner of Education from September 1980 to April 1985 and also September 1992 to January 2005.<br /><br />President Eyring was president of Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho, from 1971 to 1977. He was on the faculty at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University from 1962 to 1971.<br /><br />He holds a B.S. degree in physics from the University of Utah and master of business administration and doctor of business administration degrees from Harvard University.Born in Princeton, New Jersey, on May 31, 1933, he has served the Church as a regional representative, a member of the general Sunday School board, and a bishop.<br /><br />President Eyring is married to the former Kathleen Johnson, and they are the parents of four sons and two daughters.</p>
<p><br />As President Bednar has said, I have come under assignment from the First Presidency to talk about the future of this institution. But I know enough about it to know that I need to talk first to the students because the Lord cares about you and would want me to recognize what has always been recognized at Ricks College, that the institution is largely determined by you. And more than that, it's more than what I say or what even the teachers say; things happen here directed by the Lord in a rather specific way for your benefit.<br /><br />A word about the lovely music. This choir has sung from the place where a choir sang the day I was inaugurated as the president of Ricks College. As they sang, somehow that came back to me again. I was touched then as I was now, not just by the beauty of your voices but by the faith. And I realized that I wasn't the only one in that room who was touched that day.<br /><br />Just a month or so ago, I was on assignment and I was in an airport in San Francisco, waiting between planes. I saw a man that I thought I recognized, and I realized that he probably was having trouble recognizing me, too. It had been a number of years. He was the dean of the graduate school at Stanford University when I left that faculty to come here to become the president many, many years ago. I remember being surprised that he came to my inauguration, knowing how busy he was. I recall that somehow in the moments of the inaugural party, moving about, I saw him. I encountered him that day, and he was crying. He expressed gratitude for having been here.<br /><br />When I met him in the lounge in San Francisco recently, his first words were: "I've retired now. I'm living in Montana." Then he wanted to tell me about a bishop of the Church that he had met. So of all the things that he would remember about me, he remembered the feelings of the gospel of Jesus Christ that he'd felt. He has not joined the Church yet, but he felt something here that you've felt. And I wanted you to know that as much as we thank the singers and those who prepared the music, what happened here today has been happening here for generations. That is, the Spirit of the Lord comes and touches people; and you've been in such a place and in such a moment today. You will years later, just like the dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, remember that there was a spirit here today.<br /><br />Now the other thing I was impressed with is that you were asked to raise your scriptures. I felt as you did that to make a promise to you that I know will be fulfilled because it has been fulfilled for me in the last few days. We live in a time of increasing difficulty and change. Many of us have felt some things that led us to the scriptures. In the last few days, I have found things I had never seen there before because, in my extremity, the Lord showed me things that He had prepared long ago to help me. I'll make you a promise: If you will, in the next few hours and days, go to the scriptures, you will, as you read them (pick them anywhere that you're led to read) see scriptures speaking to you as if it was the voice of God, as if He knew your needs and your concerns; and He will tailor that to you, and it will be a witness to you that He knows you and that in that set of scriptures that you lifted above your head is a means by which He can guide you and comfort you. I promise you, you'll have that experience--and it will be very personal--in the next few days.<br /><br />Now, in the past few days our world changed. We were forced to look into the face of terrorism, not in a work of fiction or through television news clips of another nation. We saw it in our own land. That has brought anxiety and it will force changes in our lives. Some of the changes will be small. For instance, I drove to Rexburg this morning because I could attend more of a meeting of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles than if I spent two hours clearing security at the airport. Some changes will be larger. Those in the National Guard and the Reserves may be called away from their families and their normal lives.<br /><br />I have a son and his wife who live with their six children in a country where there are personal risks. Those risks may now increase. His career depends on taking a series of international assignments. Should he change careers? What should he teach his children about risks and fear? We have two other sons, both former students at Ricks College, who work in an industry already hard-pressed by a faltering economy. They live in Boston. They flew the very flights that were involved in the tragedy this last week often, but by the blessing of heaven were at home on that day. Now there is a possibility that what happened in New York and Washington will further depress the economy and the capital markets. What changes should they consider? What should they teach their children about the future and uncertainty?<br /><br />Each of us finds ourselves asking: "What other parts of my world that I thought were stable have now become uncertain?" No wonder that you and I have heard and read so often in the last few days "everything has changed." But at least two things will help us take courage and find direction.<br /><br />First, change is part of life. For instance, growing up and growing older are adventures in change filled with uncertainties and surprises. And second, God, through prophets, prepared us to expect changes to accelerate in the world. Do you remember the words from section 45 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 26-27:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And in that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail them, and they shall say that Christ delayeth his coming until the end of the earth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And the love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound."</p>
<p>Although we face an increase in challenges, there is another change sweeping the earth. It is a flood of opportunity. The steady flow of invention is an example. A generation ago there were no small computers. But now university campuses connect them with fiber-optic cable, and that cable may be replaced soon by wireless technologies. There are now tens of thousands of people taking BYU courses through Web technology. There was no Web a few years ago. The cell phones, which figured so touchingly in the tragedies of last week, did not exist a generation ago. The list of powerful and helpful new technological miracles goes on and on, and the rate of innovation is accelerating. We will live for better or for worse with rapid change and the uncertainty it brings. You and I want to make that change work for the better for us and not for the worse. We could learn much of how to do that from what has been done at this school in the last year. The people here have set an example for us worthy of our support and our emulation.<br /><br />Now I move away from my text for a moment. I've written this out because I wanted to be sure that I had the opportunity to share it in advance with President Hinckley--which I did--but I have felt at this moment that I needed to move away from that to speak to you so that you'd be sure to understand what this means for you.<br /><br />This is a world of change. Both the increase of difficulty (and that's coming--the scriptures make that clear and the prophets have made that clear) and the increase of opportunities will bring tremendous change. What I intend to do is to describe to you the miraculous way in which this institution has done what you must do. I need to be very clear, and here it is.<br /><br />Most of you, with caring parents, have at least once or twice as you left the house heard these words, "Remember who you are." Some of you remember hearing it with pain. "Oh, Mother. There you go again." Or, "Oh, there's Dad acting like a dad again." Remember who you are.<br /><br />What I'd like to suggest to you is that they were telling you the right thing, but it assumed you had asked and answered a question correctly to know who you really are. Now think of the difficulty. One of the reasons it didn't work for some of you, by the way, is that you went out and did dumb things remembering who you were because you remembered "I know who I am. I'm a crazy, mixed-up teenager, still trying to figure out who I am; and I remember, yeah, I remember who I am." And of course, then it doesn't work very well, does it? If you remembered "Oh, yeah. I'm the captain of the football team," or the basketball team, or something else, it might have helped a little bit. Or "I'm an example to my brothers and sisters." I don't know what it was, but I'll just tell you this-answering that question well and wisely will determine whether or not [you progress] in a world where you must make changes (some because there are opportunities you will have taken advantage of, some just in the course of life, some because of difficulties-many reasons). You're going to change tremendously and the world around you is going to change. The purpose of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to change you so that you're not trying to resist change. You're trying to have change take you where the Lord wants you to go. How you answer the question of who you are will determine almost everything.<br /><br />What I will now read to you, carefully prepared and seen by the prophet of God, is a description of the process that this institution has gone through and why the way they have done it has led the Lord to tell them who they are in such a way that even though they change, the part of them that God would have stay the same will stay the same. Now, I just have to quickly say that each of you, individually, has had messages sent to you throughout your life, just as this institution has had messages sent to it about what the Lord sees as special and distinct.<br /><br />I had the experience, as a young boy growing up in New Jersey, of reading the scriptures in school, before the Constitution was interpreted to say that was illegal. So, in the Princeton Township School they used to have, every day, a student pick a scripture to read. And every time I was ever asked, I always read the same scripture. The poor kids in the class had to listen to it over and over again when my turn came because, for some reason, I had been told, "This is for you; this is about you." And so every thirty days, or however many students there were, my turn would come and I would read from chapter&nbsp;13 of 1&nbsp;Corinthians the same verse: "Charity suffereth long, and is kind; . . . charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up" (1&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4).<br /><br />That is a beautiful description of Paul. And I had been told as a little boy, "This is about you. And this is about the good life you will sometime have in a family." Now, this was when I was a little, little boy. I was thinking about the New York Yankees, not about a family.<br /><br />Years later a patriarch put his hands on my head. Gascoe Romney (the grandfather, by the way, of Mitt Romney, who's the one running things in our Olympic efforts in Utah) put his hands on my head and gave me a blessing. He didn't know me. He had no way to know about that scripture. He described to me the home that I might someday have exactly as I had seen it every time I heard that scripture as a little boy. And so I am eyewitness that God is speaking to you. He really is. He knows who you are--each of you distinct, each of you with some possibilities of great contribution and a good life--and He is trying always to tell you who you are.<br /><br />What I will now describe, as I return to this text, is the miraculous thing that has happened here--where the Lord has guided this institution and will guide it in such a way that although there will be tremendous change, the personal deep and spiritual characteristics of the place will not only not be lost, they will be enhanced. Here they were forced to learn about rapid change.<br /><br />Fifteen months ago, without warning, they were told that the two-year Ricks College was to become the four-year BYU-Idaho. What they have done since then is miraculous, and it is a two-fold miracle.<br /><br />First, there is the miracle in how much they have done. In those fifteen months they created a detailed plan, hired new faculty, received conditional accreditation status which could have taken years, and then launched this venture, BYU-Idaho. And change will not end. The phrase "rethinking education" is not to be only a slogan for the transformation from a two- to four-year status, the school is to be a place of educational innovation--permanently.<br /><br />The second part of the miracle is the way they have made the changes. The people who serve here have found a way to make changes--great and rapid changes--that will enhance, not replace, the best of what the school has always been. Because of that, I can with confidence make you a promise. When you return in some distant future, you will find great innovation has become commonplace, and yet, amidst all the changes, the school will have retained and enriched the basic characteristics that blessed your life.<br /><br />Let me tell you how that has happened in the last fifteen months and why I am so confident that it will continue. It is worth your hearing because it could be applied in our personal lives. Each of us wants to live in a world of change where our personal reaction to it is not only productive but where it enhances the best of what we are. We could begin where those who lead the school did. They took the words of living prophets as their guide.<br /><br />President Hinckley chairs the Board of Trustees. On June 21 in the year 2000, he read a brief announcement to the media in Salt Lake City. The text is less than a single page. It has only twenty-one sentences in it, yet in the faithful way the people here followed that guide lays the basis of my optimism about the future.<br /><br />One of the shortest sentences in the announcement is this one: "Adjustments to its mission will be minimal." Now, think for a moment of the rush of pride that might come into a human heart on being told your two-year college was to become a "university," and not an obscure university.<br /><br />The announcement read: "The new four-year school will be known as Brigham Young University-Idaho, with the name change designed to give the school immediate national and international recognition." That could tempt, in fact it&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;tempt, most people to make a minimal adjustment in the mission of the school to look more like the secular schools whose praise we might want. But the mission statement submitted to the accreditation agency in the plan entitled, "Substantive Change Prospectus for the Addition of Degree Programs at a Higher Level" was not changed at all. These could be the words of President Thomas E. Ricks or Principal Jacob Spori or any of the leaders from the beginning.<br /><br />The first goal, stated boldly and plainly in the prospectus, is to "build testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and to encourage living its principles." That choice to put the Savior and His purposes first is the primary basis of my confidence in the future.<br /><br />Every innovation, every change, will be measured against this test of the heart. How would this proposed change build testimony and true conversion to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in the heart of a student? True conversion comes by gaining sufficient faith to live the principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Some potential and proposed innovations will help that to happen. There will be other innovations proposed that would be less helpful or might even hinder. The cumulative effect of change here will be to build testimony and accelerate true conversion.<br /><br />Another effect of that goal will be to bring here only teachers who have the Savior and His goal in their hearts. That choice to put the Savior at the center led to the other key choices made in the transition and will assure that those choices will endure. For instance, President Hinckley said in the announcement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"BYU-Idaho will continue to be teaching oriented. Effective teaching and advising will be the primary responsibilities of its faculty, who are committed to academic excellence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The institution will emphasize undergraduate education and will award baccalaureate degrees; graduate degree programs will not be offered. Faculty rank will not be a part of the academic structure of the new four-year institution."</p>
<p>Only people who put the Savior first and take His life as their model could do that, since it is so foreign to so much of what goes on in universities. There are good people who think that it's impossible to have academic excellence without, in time, adding graduate programs. And most faculties so treasure the marks of personal status that they would be puzzled by a university without faculty rank. But there will be outstanding undergraduate education, even with those apparent paradoxes.<br /><br />President Hinckley, in the press conference after his announcement, said, "It will be just as good a teaching institution as we can make it." That will happen because the Savior is and will be the great exemplar. He was a teacher. His work and glory was to lift others. He taught His disciples not to set themselves as being better than others, but to be the servants of all. Only a faculty who believe those things could see a blessing in serving without academic rank. Only a faculty with hearts set on the Savior could believe that they could keep growing as teachers in their changing and challenging fields without graduate programs. Only those with faith that the Savior will help them would respond with enthusiasm to President Bednar's vision of the future for this faculty:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In my mind the overarching theme for all of our scholarly work at Brigham Young University-Idaho should be inspired inquiry and innovation. Let me repeat that: inspired inquiry and innovation. We are not like other institutions of higher education; we have access to the gifts of the Spirit, which cannot be quantified nor counted. There are simply things we cannot adequately define and describe about the process of teaching with the Spirit. But, nonetheless, we should be excellent scholars, and our scholarship should be focused on the processes of learning and teaching. We will not be a recognized and highly regarded research institution in the traditional sense of that term. We will, however, emphasize a wide range of scholarly endeavors and excel in and play a pioneering role in understanding learning and teaching processes with faith and hard work, and in the process of time."</p>
<p>That pioneering role as a leader in understanding learning and teaching will come to pass. I, as a servant of Jesus Christ, testify to you that I know that will happen. Even with these apparently humble and even paradoxical standards of what we will be and who we will be, that miracle will occur and this institution, in the world, will become a place that people know of because of the insights that will come as we come to understand the teaching and learning process here. I so testify.<br /><br />The school will enhance another of its characteristics which will carry it safely through turbulent times, and it will come from showing students by example how to live with great faith. That characteristic is frugality. Listen again to the words of President Bednar speaking to the faculty and staff during this time of change:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"There is a responsibility to be prudent in the management of the resources, and there are places where we need to improve. If there is an example of&nbsp;<em>use it up, wear it out, making do, or do without</em>, we are that place. If we ever lost that, we would be in trouble. So we need to be careful what we ask for."</p>
<p>Now those of you who are young don't understand all that was in that statement. I was the president of Ricks College. I couldn't understand. I couldn't understand why the Brethren were always coming to me, the men who lead the Church, when I was the president, saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"What more can we do for you? What more can we do for you?" I didn't understand that. I now do. They knew this place, and they knew we wouldn't ask. They knew we'd make do. Listen to President Bednar:"I think, for example of the word&nbsp;<em>Spartanism</em>. All of us who have read Greek history know there are some aspects of Spartan culture that are not noteworthy nor praiseworthy nor of good report."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That was plagiarism from Paul. No, that was plagiarism from the thirteenth Article of Faith. Excuse me; my Primary was limited. We didn't have Primary in New Jersey in the mission field, and I didn't get that."There are, however, some things we are to be pursuing. As I define the word&nbsp;<em>Spartanism</em>, it refers to rigorously self-disciplined and self-restrained. That is part of the spirit of Ricks at Brigham Young University-Idaho--simple, frugal, or austere; courageous in the face of pain, danger, or adversity."I need to say I read every document I could get my hands on to prepare this for President Hinckley's approval. And I read it worrying. I thought, you know with all the change that's going on there, they're going to lose their way. I want you to know (as a former president of Ricks College, as someone who came here as a young man and tried to find my way, and now as the commissioner of education and as a member of the Quorum of Twelve), I wept as I read the things that President Bednar said to this faculty during his period of time--knowing, first, that he was raised up for this task; but secondly, that the very things the Lord had told me, and told me over and over again, he said in better words than I could have said them, and that's why I am quoting President Bednar so much here in this talk; it is not to flatter him. I want you to know that the Lord revealed to him some things that are true and are permanent and will guide this institution. Now that was the end of the quotation from him. I say this now for myself:<br /><br />I am not sure where the Spartans got those characteristics, but I know why they are possessed by true disciples of Jesus Christ. Latter-day Saint pioneers came to this place for the Lord. They built this school in their poverty. The first principal, Jacob Spori, housed his family in an unheated grain storage shed in his first winter because that's all they had. The people here have treated all they had as the Lord's and always counted it as enough. And they have used it as if it was the offering of the poorest widow to her Lord and to His Kingdom. Nor have they felt badly treated when the Lord asked them to take less and yet give more. Because of that faithful obedience and sacrifice, I certify the Lord has poured out His Spirit here.<br /><br />There will be a practical benefit, in turbulent times, from that frugality borne of faith. There will come times when the Lord's prophet will ask us to do more with less. Knowing that will come, we must and will find ways to improve and to innovate that require little or no money. We will depend more upon inspiration and perspiration to make improvements than upon buildings and equipment. Then hard economic times will have little effect on the continuous innovation that will not cease at this school, even in the most difficult times.<br /><br />The true disciples who have served here have believed that if they were frugal and faithful the Lord will provide enough to do His work. They have rarely deserved the chastening in chapter 6 of the Prophet Joseph Smith's translation of Matthew:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">"Why is it that ye murmur among yourselves, saying, We cannot obey thy word because ye have not all these things, and seek to excuse yourselves, saying that, After all these things do the Gentiles seek.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">"Behold, I say unto you that your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">"Wherefore, seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you" (JST, Matthew 6:36-38).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">President Hinckley expressed confidence that frugality was here and would endure when he said in his announcement: "With some additions and modifications, the physical facilities now in place in Rexburg are adequate to handle the new program. Undoubtedly, some changes to the campus will be necessary. However, they will be modest in nature and scope."<br /><br />He also said: "Of necessity, the new four-year institution will be assessing and restructuring its academic offerings. Predictably, the school will need to change and eliminate some long-standing and beneficial programs as the school focuses upon key academic disciplines and activities."<br /><br />Now, President Hinckley has long experience in education--long experience-- so he knew how remarkable it was to pay such a tribute to this place. He said there would be focus, not a growth and spread, in the academic offerings. He expected that people would willingly sacrifice what they do best and love most for what the Lord wants even more for our students. He expected that people here would find ways to make the physical space already in place sufficient to do more for more students. Listen to this from his announcement and consider the tribute he was paying with his confidence:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">"BYU-Idaho will operate on an expanded year-round basis, incorporating innovative calendaring and scheduling while also taking advantage of advancements in technology which will enable the four-year institution to serve more students."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The expectation is clearly that inspired and frugal people will find ways to bless more students at ever lower cost per student. That has been true at some times in the past. It will be true in the future, whatever the turbulent times ahead will bring. For those characteristics to endure, the students--you and those who follow you--must play a major part. It is their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His restored gospel and their obedience to His commandments that will put Him at the center of the school. Their faith will largely determine whether we learn here by study and also by faith. As we do, we will attain academic excellence. We will not attain academic excellence without that faith of yours as students and those that follow to learn by study and by faith. It is your frugality and their frugality, their willingness to make due with a little less, that will set a tone for the campus. Their sacrifice, your sacrifice, will bring down the blessings of heaven as it always has. The students will learn from example how to keep on a steady upward course in times of great change. They will see leaders and teachers and staff members for whom the Savior and His kingdom are at the center of their lives. From that example, I make a prophecy. Now listen carefully.<br /><br />From that example they--you--will become life-long teachers in their families, in the Church, and in their work, and they will bless others wherever they go by what they have learned about innovating with scarce resources and treating all they have as if it were the Lord's.<br /><br />You can imagine the joy of an employer or a Church leader when such a graduate arrives. The graduates will be at personal peace by having kept the commandments. They will be natural leaders who know how to teach and how to learn. They will have the power to innovate and improve without requiring more of what money can buy. Those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become--and this is a prophecy that I am prepared to make and make solemnly--those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve.<br /><br />Each of us can follow the example we have seen here. We can follow a steady upward course in a world of change without fear, welcoming the opportunities. The way is a simple one, clearly marked. It is to keep our eyes and hearts fixed on that which is unchangeable. We must have an eye of faith fixed on eternal life. That life, the greatest of all the gifts of God, is to live in glory forever in families in the presence of our loving Heavenly Father. It takes a focused eye. Listen. Alma, chapter 5, verse 15:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">"Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal [life]?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For our eyes to be focused on eternal life, we must have unwavering confidence and our hearts fixed on the Savior. He said, in 3 Nephi, chapter 9, verses 14-15:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">"Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall have eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">"Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father glorified his name."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our hearts, fixed on Him and His work, will keep us on course, however the wind blows. We will follow His prophet. We will see the greatest work of our lives as nurturing others as the Savior did. We will see the potential in others as He sees it. We will treat every resource that comes into our hands as a trust from Him. We will see our victories as a gift from Him and so be proof against pride. We will not fear because we will know we are on His errand.<br /><br />Now, you young people, I need to commend you and warn you, if I may. A number of you dressed carefully to come to this meeting, not for me but for the Lord. A number of you were quiet at the beginning, not for me or for President Bednar but for the Lord. A number of you in this room, I know, have been praying. I have felt that. One of the joys of coming to Ricks College has always been for me to know that I would go into a room where people of faith would be praying that the Holy Ghost would be poured out. Every time I come, I always have a confirmation that that's happened again. One of the reasons that we can prophesy about the academic excellence that will be here is you will do that same thing in classes. And those that follow you will do it in classes. You will do it in the evenings. You'll pray for the blessings of heaven to come down upon your teachers. You'll pray that you'll be taught by the Holy Spirit. The prayer that I've felt in this room is one of the things that has made this institution worthy of the trust that has been given it by the prophet of God. I want you to know that, that I know that about you.<br /><br />Now, in addition, I would suggest this: The very fact that you dress nicely, I understand, at least is partly true because somebody may have said something to you. One of your friends may have suggested, "Why don't we go dressed a little better for that meeting today." Those of you in this room who did that (and I don't know how many there are; there may be just a few who said, "Why don't we do a little more so that the Spirit of God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."--you may not have used these words, but what you were saying was "Let's go to that meeting in such a way that we might bring down the powers of heaven"), those of you in the room that had the courage to do that, to try to influence the persons around you, I'll make you a prophecy. I will simply tell you: The day will come that that capacity to influence people around you for good will have you singled out as one of the great leaders in whatever place you're in. They will not quite know why, but you will know that the reason you are being singled out is not because of your innate gifts as a leader but because you have done what the Savior would do--learned how to, and did, reach out to those around you to try to lift them, to help them to be better even when it might be a little bit difficult and you might not have been received very well.<br /><br />Another thing that I will say to you. I've mentioned so much about frugality. You might say, "Brother Eyring, that's an awful thing to say. We go first-class in the Church. Why would you talk about that? I mean, heavens, we want to make it as fancy as we can." I would only say this to you:<br /><br />You want to have a beautiful campus. You want to have a beautiful place that you live in someday in your family. You want to have things as nice as you can have them. But I'll tell you something. One of the things that you do is to always look at every nice thing you have as God's and treat it very, very carefully. This campus will be beautiful because you don't think it's yours--you think it's His, and you'll care for it that way. In addition, you will not ever, ever ask for more than you need. You will always say, "Is there a way, with more effort, more faith, more innovation, that I could do the things the Lord wants without asking for more of the resources that are in scarce supply even in a Church that appears to have great resources, as we do. But the needs are great, and the opportunities are tremendous for what can be done.<br /><br />I want you to know that the reason those people from the Board of Education used to say, "Hal, isn't there something more we could do for you up there at Ricks College?" is that they were almost afraid we wouldn't ask; that we might run just a little too lean, just a little too hard, trying to do the best we could with what we had; just afraid we might overdo it because that's who we were.<br /><br />I testify to you this beautiful campus that you see now is the reward from a loving God and His Board of Education that said: "We know those people. We know what they're like. They're out of a pioneer heritage, and they don't think that the things they have mean much. It's what they are. And they think they can do a very great deal without very much."<br /><br />Now I testify to you that that blessing is both a practical one and a spiritual one. It's practical because then the Lord will provide when we do need something, and He'll provide generously because He trusts us. But it has another benefit as well. I testify to you that that spirit of sacrifice, that spirit of trying to give just a little bit more and ask a little less brings down the powers of heaven. And all of this great future that we're speaking of at this institution will depend upon miracles regularly occurring, where students learn more than you thought you could learn. Some of you have already been praying for that miracle. It will come. Do your homework, by the way; don't just pray. I've tried. Straight revelation in a mathematics examination--it does not work very well. It's better to have studied the work ahead of time. We'll do both, but that kind of a blessing will come. You will be learners. Your teachers will teach better than their natural capacities would ever allow them to do because the powers of heaven will come down. They will come down because of your faith.<br /><br />Remember my little talk to you about frugality is an example of your faith. It's not the only way. But it's one way in which you'll say, "Look, we know that with the help of heaven we can do more than anybody could imagine with the resources that we have. We know that with the help of heaven even those of us who thought we couldn't learn mathematics can learn mathematics or learn a language. We know that that's possible."<br /><br />The miracle that President Bednar spoke of and that I promised you--that this will become a place renowned for its understanding of teaching and learning--will have to face the very problem he, under inspiration, pointed out in his talk to the faculty. We can't "quantify the gifts of the Spirit." We don't know how that works. We probably never will write academic papers about how that works. But we will be able to do things here that will amaze the world in terms of the rate and the quality of learning, and we will learn ways about how that is done that will apply in other places in the world, but never quite as well as they apply here. That's a little like the people who say, "Could I borrow your family home evening manual? I want to have a family like yours." And the answer is, "It ain't in the manual." The manual is a reflection of what it is that happens in those family home evenings.<br /><br />It will be that way here as well. We will have a spiritual outpouring, because of your faith and the faith of the faculty and those who lead here, that will lead us to be legendary in terms of our capacity to teach and to learn and in our capacity to innovate without needing the resources that others have to have in order to be the remarkable contributors you're going to be. And that's going to follow you everywhere you go.<br /><br />I hope I live long enough to someday meet some employer who employed one of you and says, "Where did that come from? I've never had such a person. Why people just flock around that person. And they want to follow. They don't have to be led; they're seeking to go where that person wants to go. And they come up with new ideas. I don't know where that comes from. They seem to find a better way, and the budget doesn't go up. I can't understand it." And I'll smile and say, "Well, come with me to Rexburg." And I may not be able to show it to you, and I may not be able to prove it to you, but you'll feel it. There will be a spirit here, I so testify, because of the love of God for all of His faithful children. And those blessings will be poured out here in rich abundance.<br /><br />Now, I leave you my blessing. I leave it to the faculty, and I leave it to the students who are here as well. I bless you that every day you are here--including the faculty who may be here for a long time and some of you I don't know how long, but awhile--I bless you that every day, if you will ask in prayer to be shown where the hand of God intervened in your life that day, I bless you that you will see that. It will be made manifest to you. That you will see that He is leading and guiding and lifting you, and that He knows you. I bless you. I bless you with confidence that if you will review the day at the end of the day and then pray and ask, you will have revealed to you evidence that the hand of God was lifting you and this institution. I so bless you.<br /><br />I further bless you that you may have the capacity to influence others. I bless you that you will be a lifter, a teacher, and a leader. I so bless you in your families, in the Church, and in wherever place you may go to serve.<br /><br />Now I leave you my testimony. The most precious gift I have. And that is this. I bless you to know that what I speak now is the truth. There is a loving Heavenly Father. He has been watching us today as He always watches us. He knows you. He has known you and has nurtured you. He has a plan for you as He has a plan for this institution of what it might become if it can just have revealed, both to the institution and to you, who you really are. Oh, He loves you! He knows you. He smiles down upon you. I so testify. He wants you to come home again to Him, I so testify. And He's provided a Savior, Jesus Christ. He lives. I know He lives. The Savior is resurrected. He is in one place at a time because He is a resurrected being, but He is aware of us and all of our Heavenly Father's children. And for all of them, He atoned for their sins and broke the bands of death, I so testify.<br /><br />Gordon B. Hinckley is a living prophet of God. I testify to you that in the years ahead, whatever difficulties may come, whatever opportunities are there, God will provide a living prophet. If you will listen, listen and believe like a child the way those who lead this institution did at this time of transition, if you will do that, whatever the transitions are in your life, you will not only retain the goodness that God has been so helpful in building into you, it will be enhanced. I testify to you that's true. I pray that I may see you again sometime. I pray that I may come back to this place again sometime and know that when I see you and when I come here I will have seen the blessings of God come down on faithful people who've allowed Him to shape them to the great opportunities that He has before you and before this place, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&copy;&nbsp;2001&nbsp;Intellectual Reserve, Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp;All rights reserved.</p>

land of liberty.  They have given cause for all to pause and ponder the principle of liberty and to
put life in its proper prospective.
			</p>
<p>In the scriptures, liberty is also referred to as freedom and agency.  It is the power to
choose for oneself between good and evil.  It is an inalienable right of all of Heavenly Father's
children (see <em>D&amp;C 98:5</em>).</p>
<p>It is eternal in nature as it existed in the pre-earth life.  Liberty is the foundational
principle in the Plan of Salvation.  Each of Heavenly Father's spiritual children had the
opportunity to choose to follow the Savior or to follow Satan in the War in Heaven (see 
			<em>D&amp;C
29:36</em>).  This was the beginning of the battle between good and evil, between choice and control,
between liberty and limits, between light and darkness, between freedom and force.</p>
<p>The battle from the beginning that will be the fight to the finish will be for the choices
that we make.  The quality of these choices is dependent upon knowing what is true.  Truth is
essential for a person to be truly free.  We are counseled <em>"Ye shall know the truth and the truth
shall make you free" </em>(<em>John 8:32</em>).  The freedom to function is predicated upon the existence of a
free society where faith prevails over fear.</p>
<p>America, the land of liberty, was founded and defended by heroes and martyrs.  We have
once again seen real heroes in action, some of whom paid the ultimate price in attempting to save
others.</p>
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>SPIRITUAL ROOTS</b></span></p>
<p>This nation is great because of its divine origin and destiny and because it was founded
with deep spiritual roots.</p>
<p><b>1.	Columbus</b></p>
<p>The hand of the Lord directed the voyage of Columbus to America.  This
accomplishment was considered in its time to be greater than putting a man on the
moon in our time.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost inspired Columbus in his search for the new world.  Columbus
acknowledged the influence of the Spirit in his life:</p>
<p>"From my first youth onward, I was a seaman and have continued until
this day.  I have spoken...with learned man...The Lord was well disposed
to my desire, and he bestowed upon me courage, and understanding,
knowledge of seafaring.  He gave me in abundance of astrology...and of
geometry and astronomy likewise.</p>
<p>He gave me joy and cunning in drawing maps...our Lord unlocked my
mind, sent me upon the sea, and gave me the fire for the deed.  Those who
heard of my enterprise called it foolish, mocked me and laughed.  But who
can doubt but that the Holy Ghost inspired me?"</p>
<p>(Jacob Wasserman, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Columbus, Don Quixote of the Seas</span>, cited in 
			<span style="text-decoration: underline">The
Great Prologue</span>, p. 26)</p>
<p><b>2.	Signers of the Declaration of Independence</b></p>
<p>The signers of the Declaration of Independence were inspired men.  They had
great courage and expressed a righteous resolve.  "We mutually pledge to each
other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor."</p>
<p>One out of nine of these inspired men gave their lives for the cause of liberty. 
Eighteen were wealthy men, seventeen suffered total property loss.  In spite of
these loses, none lost their sacred honor, there was not a single defecter, even
when it seemed that victory would be impossible.</p>
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>LAND OF LIBERTY</b></span></p>
<p><em>"And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting the principle of
freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belong to all mankind, and is
justifiable before me...I the Lord God made you free, therefore ye are free indeed;
and the law also maketh you free."  (D&amp;C 98:5,8) (see also D&amp;C 101:76-77).</em></p>
<p>Our America the beautiful is hallowed and sacred soil.  It is the place that was prepared
for the restoration of the Gospel.  It is the place that has the governance of His Church and
Kingdom on the earth today.  It is the place to which He will return in His power and majestic
glory.  </p>
<p>It is the place that the agency of man can be freely exercised as it was ordained to do so by the
Lord when He proclaimed:</p>
<p><em>"That every man may act in doctrine and example...according to the moral
agency which I have given unto him, and every man may be accountable for his
own sins in the day of judgment."  (D&amp;C 101:78).</em></p>
<p>In the dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple the Prophet Joseph Smith pleaded with
the Lord:</p>
<p>This great land of liberty was destined to come forth to fulfill its divine purposes.  It was
to be the land of promise, the land of liberty, and indeed a choice land.  After his arrival, Lehi
proclaimed:</p>
<p><em>"...we have obtained a 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">land of promise</span>, a land which is 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">choice above all other lands</span>; a
land which the Lord God hath <span style="text-decoration: underline">covenanted</span>...unto me and to my children forever, and also
all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord."  (2 Nephi
1:5).</em></p>
<p><em>"...it shall be a 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">land of liberty</span> unto them; wherefore, they shall<span style="text-decoration: underline"> never be brought down
into captivity</span>, if so it shall be because of iniquity." (2 Nephi 1:7).</em></p>
<p><em>"And if...they shall keep his commandments they 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">shall be blessed</span>...and there shall be
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">none to molest them</span>, nor to take away the land of their inheritance; and 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">they shall dwell
safely forever</span>."  (2 Nephi 1:9).</em></p>
<p>In the preservation of this choice land, we must not only have a love of liberty but we
must also be aware that the fulfillment of the Lord's promises are predicated upon the avoidance
of iniquity in this land.</p>
<p><em>"For behold this is a 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">choice land</span>, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">free
from bondage</span>, and from captivity and from all other nations under heaven, 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">if they</span> will
but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ... (Ether 2:12).</em></p>
<p>The Lord has given us a comforting and powerful promise concerning this great land:</p>
<p><em>"And this land shall be a<span style="text-decoration: underline"> land of liberty</span>...and there shall 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">be no kings</span> upon the land...and
I will fortify this land against all nations...."  (2 Nephi 10:11-12).</em></p>
<p>King Mosiah spoke of the need for unity and concern for others to exist in this land.  It
was to be a land of laws guaranteeing the rights of all to be protected:</p>
<p><em>"I desire that this land be a 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">land of liberty</span>, and every man may enjoy his 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">rights</span> and
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">privileges</span> alike...."  (Mosiah 29:32).</em></p>
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>UNDERSTANDING</b></span></p>
<p>The events that happened on September 11, 2001, must be viewed in an eternal context
and not in isolation.  These horrific happenings are a part of the ever increasing intensity in the
battle for the freedom of Heavenly Father's children.</p>
<p>Perhaps the description of the apostle Paul is appropriate today giving proper perspective:</p>
<p><em>"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
places."  (Ephesians 6:12).</em></p>
<p>There seems to be some similar motives and means that are used by the adversary in his
role as the destroyer.  His motivation from the very beginning is to destroy the agency of man
(see <em>Moses 4:3</em>), to destroy souls (see <em>D&amp;C 10:27</em>) and to destroy the work of God.  (see 
			<em>D&amp;C
10:23</em>).</p>
<p>His methods of destruction have been similar from the very beginning.  His works of
darkness are designed and delivered in secret.  The murder of Able by Cain was planned in
secret.  Cain swore an oath of secrecy with the adversary:</p>
<p><em>"And Satan said unto Cain: Swear unto me by thy throat, and if thou tell it thou shalt die
and swear thy brethren by their heads, and by the living God, that they tell it not for if
they tell it, they shall surely die...."  (Moses 5:29).</em></p>
<p><em>"And all these things were done in secret."  (Moses 5:30).</em></p>
<p>Secret combinations have been a main method used by Satan.  These secret combination
are often wide spread among nations.  Moroni spoke of these destructive secret combinations:</p>
<p><em>"And they were kept up by the power of the devil to administer these oaths unto the
people, to keep them in darkness, to help such as sought power to gain power, and to
murder, and to plunder, and to lie, and to commit all manner of wickedness."  (Ether
8:16).</em></p>
<p>This destructive method of Satan will not have long term success.  Moroni warns:</p>
<p><em>"And whatsoever nation shall uphold such secret combination...behold they shall be
destroyed...."  (Ether 8:22).</em></p>
<p>The shocking scenes that we saw on our television sets September 11, 2001, are strikingly
similar to those that were seen by Alma and Amulek.  Wicked men maliciously murdered
innocent men, women, and children because they believed in the living God.  They cast them into
the fire.  They experienced a painful death.</p>
<p>Alma and Amulek were forced to observe the suffering of these souls.  Mormon
described this scene with these words:</p>
<p><em>"And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the
fire, he also was pained."  (Alma 14:10).</em></p>
<p>The heavens must have wept along with us during that dreadful day of darkness when we
witnessed the attacks in New York City and Washington DC.  The description of that day is
reminiscent of the day spoken of by the Lord in the revelation given to Thomas Marsh through
the Prophet Joseph Smith.  He said, it was:</p>
<p><em>"A day of burning, a day of...weeping, of mourning, and of lamentation."  (D&amp;C 112:24).</em></p>
<p>It is always sad to see people suffer but even more sad to see innocent people suffer as the
result of sinful acts of others.  Some have questioned why this could have happened to those who
were without cause.</p>
<p>Our knowledge and understanding of these matters is limited.  It is sometimes difficult to
understand how the agency of one person can be allowed to cause damage or death of another
person.</p>
<p>Perhaps a partial explanation may be found in the scriptures and in the counsel of the
prophets.  In the grand council in Heaven the decision was made to organize this earth as a place
upon which we would dwell.  (See <em>Abraham 3:24</em>).</p>
<p>The Savior expressed one of the purposes for the Creation when He said:</p>
<p><em>"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they would do all things whatsoever the Lord
their God shall command them."  (Abraham 3:25).</em></p>
<p>The Savior declared:</p>
<p><em>"My people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive the glory
that I have for them...."  (D&amp;C 136:31).</em></p>
<p>Perhaps the counsel given by Moroni concerning the principle of faith would be
appropriate for us to ponder as we seek for answers to questions that seem to have no answers:</p>
<p><em>"...wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial
of your faith."  (Ether 12:6)</em></p>
<p>Alma gives us further insight as we strive to understand what has happened:</p>
<p><em>"For the Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his judgment may come upon the
wicked..."  (Alma 60:13).</em></p>
<p>Elder James E. Faust gave added insight into the answer to the question of why it
happened.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>"There is a divine purpose in the adversities we encounter every day.  They prepare, they
purge, they purify, and thus they bless."  (James E. Faust, 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, May 1979, p. 59).  
				</p>
<p>The words of President Spencer W. Kimball add clarity with this counsel:</p>
<p>"Now, we find many people critical when a righteous person is killed...Some become
bitter when oft repeated prayers seem unanswered...if all the sick were healed, if all the
righteous were protected and the wicked destroyed, the whole program of the Father
would be annulled, and the basic principle of the Gospel, free agency, would be ended." 
(President Spencer W. Kimball, "Tragedy or Destiny," 
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">Improvement Era</span>, March 1966, pp
180, 210)</p>
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>SIGNS OF THE TIMES</b></span></p>
<p><b>1.	Hearts would be
  hardened</b></p>
<p><em>"And the love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound."  (D&amp;C
45:27).</em></p>
<p><em>"...men will harden their hearts against me, and they will take up the
sword, one against another, and they will kill one another."  (D&amp;C
45:33).</em></p>
<p><b>2.	Wars and rumors of wars</b></p>
<p><em>"And in that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars, and the
whole earth shall be in commotion."  (D&amp;C 45:26).</em></p>
<p><b>3.	Fear will increase</b></p>
<p><em>"And all things shall be in commotion; and surely mens hearts shall fail
them; for fear shall come upon all people."  (D&amp;C 88:91).</em></p>
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>TRAGEDY</b></span></p>
<p>Each of these great disasters has and will be recorded in rich detail in the history of this
country.  Many of these events have been indelibly imprinted in the memory of our minds. 
Sadly, sometimes the lessons we should have learned will be eventually lost.</p>
<p>As members of the Church, we are not strangers to tragic events, as our own Church
history has been replete with these recorded events.  Sadly, the history of the world has only
fragments of the facts of these faith-promoting experiences.  The details of the hallowed human
hurts have somehow escaped the recorded history of our great nation.  The suffering of the Saints
at the hands of the mobs in Missouri, the massacre at Haun's Mill, the extinction order of
Governor Boggs, the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother, Hyrum, the
burning of the Nauvoo temple are only a passing period on a page in the history of the world.
		</p>
<p>We remember these events well, as they are recorded in our spiritual memory banks.  We
also remember the trail of shallow and sometimes frozen graves that are placed across the plains
with no markers for future memory.  Our history is not only that of a trail of tears from Palmyra
to Parley's Canyon, but one that has seen the fulfillment of the prophesy that was given by the
Savior:</p>
<p><em>"And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have power to lay the
foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the
only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am
well pleased..."  (D&amp;C 1:30).</em></p>
<p>These triumphs were not easy battles but they were essential battles.  They
represent victory of virtue over vice.  It was a success of good over evil.  It was a triumph of
testimony over tyranny.</p>
<p>The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon are yet another in a series
of battles against the forces of evil.  This and future battles will be the same as those fought
in the past.  Just as the price of victory in past battles has left a trail of tears, this may also
be true in the present and future encounters.</p>
<p>To keep this and other tragedies in their proper perspective we can find comfort in
the counsel of Elder Neal A. Maxwell when he said:</p>
<p>"Sin is the only real and lasting tragedy."  (Elder Neal A. Maxwell, 
			<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>,
May 1983, p.11).</p>
<p>He also gave counsel of clarity that should give us courage as we respond to the
tragedies that we experience or that we see in the lives of others:</p>
<p>"For the faithful, our finest hours are sometimes during or just following our
darkest hours."  (Elder Neal A. Maxwell, 
			<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, May 1984, p. 22).</p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">BLESSINGS</span></strong></p>
<p>We must not become overwhelmed and fearful as a result of the tragedy that we
have seen.  We must not have doubt or become discouraged.  We must not be depressed. 
The Savior counseled that <em>"after much tribulation come the blessings."  (D&amp;C 58:4).</em></p>
<p>In spite of the terrible tribulations that we have seen, we have also seen many
miracles and blessings.  It seems that we have been shaken and there has been an
awakening in each of us of the important things that we have allowed to become dormant
in our lives.</p>
<p><b>1.	Unity</b></p>
<p>This nation has perhaps never been more unified than now.  Barriers have
been broken.  The spirit of contention has seemed to cease.  Our government
has become unified.  Officials are bound together with the people in a sacred
cause to preserve our liberties and our freedoms.</p>
<p><b>2.	Patriotism</b></p>
<p>Rarely have I seen such a fervent spirit of patriotism exhibited.  It has moved
many to tears.  Flags grace this land of liberty.  Patriotic music can be heard
everywhere.  It is now common to hear the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag
and to see salutes of respect.</p>
<p><b>3.	Love</b></p>
<p>There has been an increase of love for country, for family and for one
another.  Spontaneous expressions of love are frequently seen.</p>
<p><b>4.	Spirituality</b></p>
<p>We have been awakened to a greater sensitivity to the things of the Spirit. 
More prayers have been rendered in public as well as in private.  Church
attendance has been increased.</p>
<p><b>5.	Service</b></p>
<p>Countless hours of selfless service have been given as the nation has closed
ranks to assist others in their times of need.  It seems that large numbers
have been:</p>
<p><em>"Willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light,...and are
willing to mourn with those that mourn...and comfort those that stand in
need of comfort..."  (Mosiah 18:8-9).</em></p>
<p><b>6.	Sacrifice</b></p>
<p>We have seen great examples of sacrifice on the part of large numbers of
people.  Without hesitation, people put themselves in harms way to assist
those who were in trouble.  Many lived the higher law of love as they laid
down their life for their fellow beings.</p>
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>PROMISES</b></span></p>
<p>The Lord has given us powerful promises that should sustain and strengthen us in
our times of need:</p>
<p><em>"Therefore, fear not, little flock, do good, let heaven and hell combine against
you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail."  (D&amp;C 6:34)</em></p>
<p><em>"Wherefore be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and
shall stand by you..."  (D&amp;C 68:6)</em></p>
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>COUNSEL</b></span></p>
<p>In our present and future times of need, we can take great comfort and confidence
in the counsel that we receive from the scriptures.  They will give us great hope and will
strengthen our faith and our resolve.  We should prayerfully ponder the following and
countless other passages of counsel that the Lord has provided for us in the sacred
scriptures.</p>
<p><em>"...be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled."  (I Peter 3:14).</em></p>
<p><em>"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding." 
(Proverbs 3:5).</em></p>
<p><em>"Put on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the
devil."  (Ephesians 6:11).</em></p>
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>NEVER ALONE</b></span></p>
<p align="left">During the darkest days of our life we must always remember that we are never
alone.</p>
<p><b>1.	Holy Ghost</b></p>
<p>One of the great roles of the Holy Ghost is to give comfort to those in need. 
The Spirit fills us with hope and with perfect love.  (See <em>Moroni 8:26</em>).  He
will quicken our knowledge and understanding of things (<em>D&amp;C 88:11</em>), and
will <em>"teach...the peaceful things of the kingdom."  (D&amp;C 36:2).</em></p>
<p><b>2.	Savior</b></p>
<p>The Savior knows each of us in a personal way.  He has given us words of
comfort and cheer when He said:</p>
<p><em>"I say unto you that mine eyes are upon you, I am in your midst and ye
cannot see me."  (D&amp;C 38:7).</em></p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks explains the meaning of the Savior being in our midst:</p>
<p>"The Savior is in our midst, sometimes personally, frequently through
His servants, and always by His Spirit."  (Oaks, Dallin H.,  
				<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Lords
Way</span>, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1991, p. 14)</p>
<p><b>3.	Scriptures</b></p>
<p>We can receive great comfort and counsel as we prayerfully ponder the
scriptures during our times of need.  When faced with an increased need for
understanding and direction we should search the scriptures for answers. 
Nephi counseled:</p>
<p><em>"Feast upon the words of Christ; for behold the words of Christ will tell
you all things what ye should do."  (2 Nephi 32:3).</em></p>
<p><b>4.	Prophets</b></p>
<p>During the days ahead we must carefully listen to the counsel of the living
prophets.  Their counsel takes precedence over all other counsel.  As Satan
increases his works of destruction, there is an ever increasing need to listen to
the voice of the prophet.</p>
<p>The Savior has counseled us to listen to our priesthood leaders as well as the
prophet:</p>
<p><em>"...whether by mine own voice or the voice of my servants, it is the
same."  (D&amp;C 1:38).</em></p>
<p>Some unfortunately choose not to listen.  At times they resist counsel.  It is no
wonder that the Lord lamented:</p>
<p><em>"And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say." 
(Luke 6:46).</em></p>
<p>There is great safety in troubled times in listening to the voice of the prophets
and our priesthood leaders.  If we do so, we have no need to fear what may
come in the future.</p>
<p><b>5.	Patriarchal Blessings</b></p>
<p>Our patriarchal blessing can be a great source of strength, comfort, and
direction during our times of need. President James E. Faust taught the principle of power in a patriarchal
blessing:</p>
<p>"God knows our spirits; He knows our strengths and weaknesses.  He
knows our capabilities and our potential.  Our patriarchal blessings
indicate what the Lord expects of us and what our potential is.  Our
blessings can encourage us when we are discouraged, strengthen us
when we are fearful, comfort us when we sorrow, give courage when
we are filled with anxiety, lift us when we are weak in spirit."  (Faust,
James E.  "Patriarchal Blessings," <span style="text-decoration: underline">New Era</span>, November 1982, page 6).</p>
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>CONCLUSION</b></span></p>
<p align="left">Our souls have been stirred with a wide range of feelings from shock to sharpness,
from anxiety to anger, from surprise to supplication.  We must not be overcome by what
we have seen and heard.</p>
<p>This is a time for reflection and for renewing of our spirits.  It is a time to be in
control of our lives and to make righteous choices.  We must, as Joshua of old<em> "choose this
day whom [we] will serve." (Joshua 24:15).</em>  We must choose:</p>
<p align="center">Faith and Not Fear<br />Hope and Not Helplessness<br />Obedience and Not Opposition<br />Repentance and Not Rebellion<br />Determination and Not Depression<br />Sacrifice and Not Selfishness<br />Service and Not Slothfulness<br />Work and Not Worry<br />Trust and Not Trifle<br />Spirituality and Not Sensuality</p>
<p>Choose to follow those things that you know to be true.  Remember that righteous
choices bring forth righteous results.  I am at peace with what the future holds.  The torch
will soon be passed to your generation to protect the divinely inspired Constitution of this
great land of liberty.  You will stand in the forefront in the battle with the adversary, in the
defense of our country and of our freedom.  I have great faith in both your will and in your
ability to be successful with this sacred trust.</p>

"There is also an artificial aristocracy, founded on wealth and birth, without either virtue or talents"
(Thomas Jefferson, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Writings</span>, 13:396).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">When I was your age President David O. McKay, said there would come a time "when nobility
of character would be recognized as being greater than intellect" (General Conference of the Sunday
School, October 1949, Improvement Era, December 1949, p. 863).  Think about that--nobility of
character would be recognized as being greater than intellect.  My hope is that even sooner nobility of
character will be recognized as being greater than outstanding athletic or musical or acting ability.  It is
to be devoutly wished that you leave here highly skilled in music, business, science, drama, the law,
athletics, history, or whatever your chosen field may be.  But I ask you: What of virtue?  I mean that in
its broadest sense.  One definition is "a moral excellence in all aspects of one's life."  When I use the
word virtue through the balance of this discussion, that is what I am talking about--a moral excellence
in all aspects of your life.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Brother Rodney Turner made a statement some years ago.  He said:</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Our moral environment is far more polluted than our physical environment.  It
seems as though good and evil are being homogenized out of existence by a generation
led by 'foolish and blind guides.'  What was once whispered in shame is now
electronically shouted from the housetops as the famous and the foolish appear on
television to parade their sins, like so many medals, before laughing, applauding
audiences (Rodney Turner, "To Learn With Joy," p. 272).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">He speaks the truth.  Now, the question I would raise: What and to whom do we give our
honor?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I enjoy, as time permits, a good NBA basketball game.  Last winter a discussion was being
held at halftime with a group that included Charles Barkley.  Maybe some of you young men and
women remember him as a player.  He is now retired.  One of the participants took him to task for
some activity which had taken place in a bar--activity that would not be acceptable under any
circumstances.  His response--remember now he is on national television and many millions were
watching.  He said, "Don't make me a role model for anyone.  That is a parent's job, not mine."  I've
thought about that a great deal.  Pay me millions for playing basketball; put me on television and let me
tell of my opinion on a variety of subjects; buy the products that I endorse, hopefully by the millions, but
don't ask me to be responsible for my actions.  Don't ask me to be responsible for my influence.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Moving, in a sense, to another generation, just a few weeks ago in the 
		<em>Deseret News</em> was an
article quoting Brittany Spears.  Apparently, her new video includes material that is less than might be
acceptable in some circles.  You know what her comment was?  "I really want this to be shocking and
edgier."  That was the phrase she used.  Then, anticipating the response from others who might be a
little more mature, she said "I don't want to be considered a role model."  Now, pay me millions for
performing, have thousands at my concerts showering adulation and money on me, buy the products I
endorse, but don't expect me to use my influence for positive purposes.  Don't hold me accountable for
my influence.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">That's the world you live in.  Think about that.  Now, what kind of thinking is this?  Where
does it come from?  Interestingly enough, it started--at least the first one I remember-- in a statement
from Samuel the Lamanite.  Samuel the Lamanite (in speaking to the Nephites) said, "Yea, how long
will ye suffer yourselves to be led by foolish and blind guides?" (Helaman 13:29).  I ask us the same
question.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Is there a way for us to test the guides in our lives--the people who want to influence us?  The
answer, of course, is yes.  There is a test.  It has many names.  In the scriptures it's called the plan of
happiness, the plan of redemption, the plan of salvation, and, my favorite, the great plan of the Eternal
God.  There is only one plan, all by different names.  If there was ever a time in the history of this world
that we need order, it is now.  And order requires a plan.  And the father of us all has given us one. 
The plan says, among other things, that there was a premortal existence.  Will you remember that?  You
did not spring into existence when you were born here in mortality.  You lived eons of time before you
came here.  Continuing, the plan tells us that agency is part of that eternal plan--the right to choose.  All
of us want the right to choose.  But sometimes in our lives we have to understand that after we have
made the choice we must accept the consequences, and often we don't like the consequences.  Let me
continue.  The plan teaches of the fall of man and of the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.  The
plan tells us that the individual survives the grave and that there is a spirit world, a judgment, and a literal
resurrection.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Now, who should you listen to in these times of severe trial.  And I say again, they will get
worse.  We have trials and tribulations ahead of us.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Tevye in "Fiddler on the Roof" taught a marvelous principle.  You'll recall he sang the song
entitled, "If I Were a Rich Man."  He expressed the thought that he would like to be rich. Do you
remember why?  So people would come to him for advice.  Then Tevye said, "It won't make one bit of
difference if I answer right or wrong.  When you're rich, they think you really know."  Is that true?  It's
important for us to understand that everything said, written, sung, or insinuated by the wealthy or
famous is not necessarily so.  Because someone is athletic or musical or handsome or wealthy or even
very intellectual does <em>not</em> mean they are wise--especially when they are not moral.  Wisdom does not
come with athletic or musical or even intellectual ability.  Wisdom is a gift of the Holy Spirit which the
Lord has reserved for the faithful and for the pure, and you will have wisdom as you grow and
experience.  But your greatest wisdom will come by those sweet, tender impressions of the spirit.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Are we supporting those who do not accept responsibility when we buy their records or pay to
see them play or purchase items they endorse?  I know what you are saying is: "What I would buy or
pay wouldn't make any difference."  That may be true, but that's one way to vote isn't it?  And I think
we should consider that when we buy products endorsed by those whom we do not sustain, or we pay
to hear them sing, or we pay to hear them play, we are voting for them.  We may not have a large vote,
but we have one.  Now the Lord indicated that we should let our light so shine before men.  One way
to let your light shine is by the way you act and by the way you vote and for whom you vote.</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Brother Truman Madsen opened a real door of enlightenment for me in his excellent work on
the life of President B. H. Roberts.  The book was called <em>Defender of the Faith</em>, and in that
book--this is going to take a little concentration so listen carefully--he quoted President Roberts
describing President Brigham Young.  In fact, President Roberts' B, for B. H., is Brigham.  His mother
had named him after President Young, apparently.  Anyway, President Roberts is describing President
Young.  Note this:</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">The quality that linked him [Brigham Young] to God; that added in large
measure the strength and wisdom of God to his own strength and wisdom . . . .</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">President Roberts was indicating that Brigham Young's power came from the strength and
wisdom of God which he had inculcated  And he went on to say:</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">The man [or woman] who so walks in the light and wisdom and power of God,
will at the last, by the very force of association, make the light and wisdom and power
of God his [or her] own--weaving those bright rays into a chain divine, linking himself
forever to God and God to him . . . .  Beyond this, human greatness cannot achieve (B.
H. Roberts, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Defender of the Faith</span> page 390.)</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Now the reverse is sadly true.  Is it not clear that he who walks in the wickedness and
depravity of Lucifer, even if only in the mind, also weaves those dark rays into a chain which will bind
him?  One whose mind is saturated, even intermittently, with wicked or pornographic thoughts will find
when he seeks to escape that he has forged a formidable chain indeed.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Elder Bruce Hafen, formerly of this institution, asked the following question:  "Have we really
comprehended how the devil operates?  Lehi's vision of the great and spacious building, for example,
tells us graphically that one main weapon used by the wicked is mocking and derision."  And Elder
Hafen indicates that "It's a lot easier to plan your defense when you know your opponent's play book"
(Bruce Hafen, BYU, Today, Sept. 1998, p. 22).  We know our opponent's play book.</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">President Ezra Taft Benson gave us insight on Satan's play book and on the Savior's play book
when he said that "the Book of Mormon was written for us today" (President Ezra T. Benson, April
Conference 1975).  Do you realize that neither the Nephites nor the Lamanites ever had the Book of
Mormon?  It was written for us today, President Benson said.  He went on to say that God, knowing
the end from the beginning, told Mormon what to put in the book that we would need for our day. 
Think about that.  When you read a chapter of the Book of Mormon, stop and ask yourself:  Why did
the Lord have Mormon put that chapter in the book, knowing that the book was written for our day?</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">For instance, let's review part of Lehi's dream.  You will recall that he beheld a rod of iron
extended along the river to a tree.  There was also a strait and narrow path with a rod of iron leading to
the path.  He said:</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river
of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the
earth.  And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and
their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking
and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the
fruit (I&nbsp;Nephi 8:26,27).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building.  And after
they did enter into that building they did point the finger of scorn at me and those that
were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded them not (I Nephi 8:33).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Tucked away as a tiny comment, was the answer--simple, clear, and enormously effective: 
"but we heeded them not."  Difficult to do?  You bet it is difficult.  Clear to understand?  Absolutely!</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">In D&amp;C 20:21-22, notice these words: "Wherefore, the almighty God gave his only begotten
son as it is written in those scriptures which have been given of him.  He suffered temptations but 
		<strong><em>gave
no heed unto them</em></strong>." [Emphasis added]  You see where our protection is?  We have to shield
ourselves.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Now I am going to give you the second protection. The first one was that we "gave them no
heed."</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious
building was the pride of the world; [You see why it was standing high above the
earth?] and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great.  And the angel of the Lord
spake unto me again saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds,
tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb (I Nephi
11:36).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">You see your protection?  Listen to the twelve apostles of the Lamb.  In this day, those fifteen
men who hold that authority in the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I'd ask you to consider with me the response when Lucifer used this very weapon against the
boy Prophet.  He had received so much scorn when he had simply told the truth about his experience in
the temple grove.  I quote from the Prophet Joseph:</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision.  I have thought
since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before King Agrippa, and
related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but still
there were but few who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was
mad; and he was ridiculed and reviled.  But all this did not destroy the reality of his
vision.  He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under heaven
could not make it otherwise . . . .</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">So it was with me.  I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw
two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and
persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were
persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so
saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth?  I have
actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world
think to make me deny what I have actually seen?  For I had seen a vision; I knew it,
and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I
knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation (Pearl of
Great Price, Joseph Smith History, 1:24-25).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Did this scorn bring the Prophet pain?  Of course it did.  He would not have given the very
paragraph I just read to you if he had not felt it very very deeply.  What did he do?  He continued with
the work of the restoration.  It hurt, but he gave it no heed.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Now I have to point out something that I think you know very well.  There is fear in every
human heart?  Did you know that?  You may think you are the only one who feels inadequate. 
Inadequacy is one of the burdens most humankind carry.  In fact, the truth is when you find one that
doesn't, he is impossible.  When scorn comes, we are all vulnerable.  I'm trying to prepare you to
handle it because you are going to be scorned if you keep the commandments and live by the plan. 
Now even Moroni shared this concern over our vulnerability.  In speaking to the Lord, he said:</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we cannot write
them; wherefore, when we write we behold our weakness, and stumble because of the
placing of our words; and I fear lest the Gentiles shall mock at our words (Ether 12:25).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Moroni knew where this book was going.  He knew to whom it was coming.  "I fear lest the
gentiles shall mock at our words."</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying: Fools mock, but
they shall morn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek . . . . (Ether 12:26).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">You notice he doesn't say my grace is sufficient for the scorned?  For the meek, and we can
then take the scorn.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Do the gentiles, and maybe even some of us who consider ourselves other than gentiles, mock
the words of Moroni?  I fear we do.  For you see, the wicked heap scorn when they have no other
weapon to use.  And too often the righteous run for cover when they are scorned by the famous, the
wealthy--especially if the mocker can run fast or jump high or sing well or has high-profile degrees or a
great deal of money, even though all of those wrapped together have nothing to do with the eternal
subject being discussed.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I ask you, what are the rewards of standing fast in your own virtue--even against the scorn of
the world?  Far more monumental than you might think.  Let me share with you the experience of
Nephi, the son of Helaman and the brother of Lehi.  He was suffering depression and discouragement
in building the kingdom of God.  I understand there are 2,400 returned missionaries on this campus.  If
there are 2,400 who were hard-working missionaries, every one of them have felt depression and
discouragement in the building of the kingdom.  Now the Lord spoke to him in the midst of this
depression.  He said:</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have
beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto
thee, unto this people.  And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own
life, but has sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">And now, because thou has done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will
bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in
works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou
shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will (Helaman 10:4-5).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">How did Nephi reach that point where the Lord said ask what you want because I know you
will not ask anything contrary to my will?  The very same thing that B. H. Roberts was saying about
Brigham Young.  Nephi had lived so close to the Lord, had kept the covenants so well, that there had
been intertwined into his very soul the principles of the gospel; and when Nephi was faced with a
decision, he didn't even have to turn to the Lord to say what should I do?  He had so intertwined those
principles that according to the Lord, "Yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy
word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will."  And he closes with "Behold, thou art
Nephi and I am God . . . ." (Helaman 10:6).  There are great blessings.  Now, because Nephi had
stood for truth and virtue without fear of the world, consider the consequences that came into his life.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Now, let me say this.  The Lord has placed prophets in the land.  Will you stop and think of the
blessing that you have.  I don't know the number of billions of people who have lived on this earth since
its existence.  Some have suggested, I think, 60 or 70 billion.  Do you know how many have lived
under the hands of living prophets as you do?  I would suggest to you that there have been great and
troublesome and difficult times in the past, but I do not think they will exceed those that you will face.  I
hope all of you were listening just a few days ago when President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke to the
youth of the Church in the satellite broadcast.  He made a statement I am going to quote to you again:
"Believe in yourselves as sons and daughters of God."  Listen carefully to this.  There is a powerful
message here.  "Believe in yourselves as sons and daughters of God."  Too many of us don't.  We
don't literally believe that God is our father.  He continues: "Men and women with unlimited potential to
do good in the world believe in personal virtue."  He's talking here about the restrictive use of that
word.  There is no substitute for it anywhere under the heavens.  "Believe in your power to discipline
yourselves against the evils which could destroy you."  Note this.  "Believe in one another as the
greatest generation ever yet to live upon the earth.  Think about that.  He doesn't say, "Believe me as
the prophet."  He says, "Believe in one another."  Have that kind of respect for the people with whom
you associate.  Now it is also interesting to me to note when he said, "the greatest generation 
		<em>yet</em> to live
upon the earth."  I believe that your sons and daughters will be an even greater generation.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Now why do you suppose the Lord has chosen to withhold you for these many years to come
forth in this day and time?  You think about it.  Why would he do that?  Because he knows the end
from the beginning, and he knows what lies ahead.  And he knows that there are some difficult and
challenging problems that we face.  Listen to the prophets.  Listen with your ears.  But more important
than that, you listen with your hearts.  You feel what they are saying.  In the first eighteen chapters of
Nephi, Nephi talks about feeling the words of the Lord.  Look it up.  Feeling, that is what I plead with
you to do.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Incidentally, do not analyze the mortal preparation to speak on the subject we are speaking on. 
You say, "Well let's see now, President Hinckley has been with the Church now since he was 25 years
old and he is 91.  He hasn't had any experience out there in the world.  We may say, "Well President
Faust is a lawyer, what would you expect?  He doesn't know anything about this subject.  President
Monson is a newspaperman, a publisher.  And I say to you their strength does not come from their
mortal preparation.  In fact, it has very little to do with it.  It is the power of God, coupled with His call
to them, that qualify them to speak on any subject.  And I would particularly draw your attention to any
document that's ever presented to us that is the united voice of the First Presidency and the Twelve as
per the Proclamation on the Family.  I bear my testimony to you the Proclamation of the Family is a
revelation from God to this people today through the prophets of God.  The Proclamation on the Living
Christ.  Why do you suppose after all of these years we have a proclamation from the First Presidency
and the Quorum of the Twelve on the Savior?  Why?  I submit to you it is very likely because this
world is moving away from the Master about as fast as it can move in terms of fundamental principles.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Now why were you called and reserved for this day?  Because you are capable of withstanding
the arrows of evil that will be coming to you. The Lord knew it.  He knows you have the power to do
it, but he cannot guarantee that you will.  Only through his prophets and through his scriptures can he
teach you.  And if you are weaving into the very fiber of your being the fundamental principles of the
gospel that you are being taught not only in your homes and in the scriptures but here at this magnificent
institution, you will be able to withstand it.  I'm going to read you a statement from Brigham Young
about that in a minute, so let me move on.  I only say to you follow the prophets, beware of those
whom the world loves and showers with fame and fortune.  Remember this.  When the world showers
people with fame and fortune, be very careful about following them.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">It is necessary that each of us obtain a witness for himself that God the Father is real and that
there is a living Savior.  Now I want to read to you from President Brigham Young and then I will
conclude.  President Young said:</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">You that have not passed through the trials and persecutions and drivings, with
this people, from the beginning, but have only read of them, or heard some of them
related, may think how awful they were to endure, and wonder that the Saints survived
them at all.  The thought of it makes your heart sink within you, your brains reel, and
your bodies tremble, and you are ready to exclaim, 'I could not have endured it.'  I
have been in the heat of it, and I never felt better in my life; I never felt the peace and
power of the Almighty more copiously poured upon me than in the keenest part of our
trials.  They appeared nothing to me" (Brigham Young, Journal of Discoveries, v 1, p.
313).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">That is the promise I make to you today.  Tribulations will come, but the Lord will sustain you if
you have made the appropriate preparation--particularly, learning how to fend off the scorn of the
world.  And when it is over you are going to say, "That wasn't all that bad."  Why?  Because you are
going to be able to say, "I never felt the peace and power of the Almighty more copiously poured out
upon me than in the keenest part of our trials."</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I bear you, my dear young brothers and sister, my witness that there is a God in Heaven.  He
has made known to me in an unmistakable way that he lives.  I bear witness to you that the Lord Jesus
Christ is the Savior of the world, the son of God in the flesh, that he literally walked forth from the tomb
inhabiting that body that hung upon the cross, and that not only did that happen to him, we will each and
every one be literally resurrected.  Remember that.  It will help you in the decisions that you are going
to face.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I bear further testimony that the Lord Jesus Christ is directing his church today through fifteen
men who hold the apostleship.  But, in addition, by revelation to you through scriptures and through
prayer, I bear again witness that he lives, that he will not leave us alone in times of trial and difficulty if
we will hear and feel in advance and make the appropriate preparations, in the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.</font></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000080">Greetings to you young brothers and sisters.  I want you to know that I admire you.  Why? 
Because President Hinckley speaks so highly of you, and I believe him.  I respect you, for tomorrow
you will be the leaders of the Church and the parents of the next generation.  I also worry about you
because you are living in a confusing, messed up world.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I am a grandmother and hope most of you have living grandparents.  We as grandparents pray
daily that your ability to recognize and respond to the whisperings of the Holy Ghost will be sharp,
keen, magnified and that you will make righteous choices.  We pray that you will internalize the
principles of the gospel, that <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> will know that they are true, that your testimony of Heavenly Father's
love for you will be strong and without doubt, and that you will feel a tender love and gratitude for our
Savior and desire to please Him, above anyone.  If you do not have a living grandparent, please know
that there are many people, President Pinegar and I included, who nightly pray for you, the noble youth
of the Church.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I believe that there are also those beyond the veil who are cheering for you to make choices
that will help you be happy.   I was visiting our daughter in California several years ago and attended a
Young Women class.  I asked one of the young women what helped her make righteous choices.  She
answered, "I think of the children I will have when I get married.  I picture them in heaven cheering for
me to be good.  They are my cheerleaders."</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">In 2 Kings 6:8-17 we are reminded of the help that is beyond the veil.  Elisha the prophet told
the king of Israel how to conduct a battle with Syria.  The king of Syria was very upset and wanted to
know who the traitor was that had leaked his war plans to Israel.  Then,  in verse twelve:</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in
Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.  And he said,
Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him.  And it was told him, saying, Behold, he
is in Dothan.  Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by
night, and compassed the city about.  And when the servant of the man of God was risen early,
and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots.  And his
servant said unto him, Alas, my master! How shall we do?  And he answered, Fear not: for
they that be with us are more than they that be with them.  And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I
pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see.  And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man;
and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about
Elisha.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">My dear brothers and sisters, we have support beyond the veil.  Without a doubt, I know we
are Heavenly Father's children.  He cares about us, He loves us, and He has a plan for our success and
happiness.  I trust in His loving plan with all of my heart.  I know that through the covenants and
ordinances we embrace, and as we grow in righteousness, we will see Him again, be with Him, and
enjoy all that He has in store for us.  I feel a deep longing to express, in person, my gratitude and my
apologies to my Savior, who is my light.  For us to receive the great blessings of the eternities we must
be righteous.  For us to feel peace within our hearts while we live here on earth we must be righteous. 
There is nothing that the world calls fun or pleasurable that can compare to the inner happiness and joy
that comes from being righteous, nothing.  That may be something you don't think much about, but if
you will take time to identify how you feel when you make an unrighteous choice and compare that to
how you feel when you make a difficult but righteous choice, you will know what I am talking about.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You have so many choices to make during this time of your life.  Today I want to talk to you
about <span style="text-decoration: underline">what matters most</span>.  As I speak to you I would like each of you to identify three things:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">First, identify what matters most to you.  Think long term.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Second, identify the things you are currently doing that will lead you to what matters
most.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When you leave this devotional, I hope that your heart will rejoice knowing that you are on the
right track, and that you will have a great desire to continue in your righteous ways.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">First, what does matter most?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A few weeks ago I was tending grandchildren while their Mom and Dad, Traci and Hans,
participated in a sprint triathalon, that's the shortest triathalon.  It was early in the morning.  I fed
Truman, nine months old, his bottle and put him on the floor with some toys.  Grayson, five years old,
and Chole, three years old, sat by my side on the couch and I began reading them a story.  The story
was getting exciting and Truman started fussing.  We gave him more toys and continued our reading. 
He fussed again and we found his binky and popped it into his mouth.  We were close to the climax of
the story and he fussed again.  Grayson said, "<span style="text-decoration: underline">Truman is more important than this book.</span>"</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In Alma 32:23 it says, "Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many
times, which confound the wise and the learned" (grandmas).</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I don't know how the story ends, but Grayson helped me think about what matters most.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There are so many things that matter, so many choices to make.  What should your major be? 
Should you study for the big test or attend the devotional?  Which of the many boys that asked you to
hang out this Friday night will you say yes to?</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Scott, in his April 2001 conference address, teaches us:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Are there so many fascinating, exciting things to do or so many challenges pressing
down upon you that it is hard to keep focused on that which is essential?  When things of the
world crowd in, all too often the wrong things take highest priority.  Then it is easy to forget the
fundamental purpose of life.  Satan has a powerful tool to use against good people.  It is
distraction.  He would have good people fill life with "good things" so there is no room for the
essential ones.  Have you unconsciously been caught in that trap?  (<em>The Ensign 
		</em>May 2001)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Can you see the value in identifying what matters most in your life in the long term?</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">I still remember the story I heard as a teenager of a boy's first experience preparing a field for
planting.  He knew how to run the tractor, and his father charged him with making straight rows so they
could plant the corn.  After a couple of rows his father stopped him and had him look at his work.  The
rows were not straight.  The young man asked, "But Dad, how do you do it?"  His father then told him
to pick a post at the end of the field and head straight for it.  
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">Identifying what matters most in your life
will give you a post to head toward, a guide to always have before you, to help you stay on track</span>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I believe as baptized members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints you know
what matters most.  I had a memorable experience as a mother of young children that helped me
remember where I wanted to go and what was most important to me.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I was at one of those stages in life when I was feeling discouraged and wondering if changing
diapers, fixing meals, vacuuming up the Cheerio and graham cracker crumbs was really what life was all
about.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">One late afternoon I was vacuuming the family room before my sweetheart came home from
work.  I liked him to think I had everything under control.  That day he arrived home early.  He walked
into the family room and put his arms around me; I quickly turned off the vacuum.  He kissed me and
told me that he loved me.  It was wonderful to feel his love.  He whispered in my ear, "I think I know
what you're going to be in the hereafter."  I needed a spiritual insight.  He continued, "You are going to
be the chief vacuumer."  I can laugh about it now but it wasn't funny then.  I may have cried; I don't
remember.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">That evening I called a babysitter; and the next morning, with stacks of paper, a pencil and in
the spirit of fasting, I went to a small cabin my parents owned.  I prayed and I wrote.  I made a list of
all the things I needed to do and wanted to do.  I wrote them as they came to me in no special order,
page after page.  I went for a walk and then wrote more--mend the clothes my children are growing
out of, read the scriptures, clean out the moldy vegetables in the bottom of the refrigerator, go to the
temple more frequently, clean the drawers in the bathroom where the toothpaste was stuck in the
comb, live with Heavenly Father with Ed and our children in a forever family, be more patient when
putting the children to bed, and on and on.  When I couldn't think of another thing I had to do or
wanted to do, I went for another walk.  When I got back I read through my list and put the number one
by what mattered most--to live with Heavenly Father with Ed and our children as a forever family.<strong>
</strong>Then I wrote number two and three and four and on down the list.  I didn't ever put a number on the
bathroom drawer with tooth paste in it.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I knew what I wanted to have happen in my life.  I knew before I had this experience what
mattered most to me.  I had that eternal vision, but it was buried under everything else I needed to do. 
I needed to clearly identify it again, to have it in my heart and mind, to see that post at the end of the
field.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">At times a terrible catastrophe happens in our lives that shakes us up and forces us to identify
our values.  That happened to all of us recently.  As I experienced with you the terrible events of
September 11 and watched the twin towers collapse and crush thousands of lives, my thoughts went to
earlier that morning as those dear people said their good-byes to their families.  There was a yearning in
my heart that their good-byes had been sweet and tender, that they had expressed love for each other
and given hugs.  I think many Americans have redefined their values and goals.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">While I have been talking, have you thought about what matters most to you?  Have you
identified your post at the end of the field?  If you haven't, when you go home make a list of all the
things you need to do and all of the many things you want to do.  Be sure to list both short-and long-term goals.  Then number, one by one, what matters most.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Identifying  what is most important in our lives is vital but it is only the beginning.  Next we must
identify the things we need to do to move toward that goal.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Second, what are you currently doing that will lead you to what matters most?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Back to my cabin experience.  After I finished numbering the things I wanted and needed to do,
I made a rough calendar of a week.  I remember asking myself, "<span style="text-decoration: underline">If that is what I really want I had 
better make certain I find time to do those things that will lead me and our family in that direction</span>.  I
then scheduled specific times on my calendar for action:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Personal scripture study</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Temple attendance</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Family time to share with our children our testimonies of what matters most and to pray
and study with them.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Organizing, preparing and fulfilling my church calling, for being a kingdom builder,
serving.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I want to talk to you about two of the actions I scheduled on my calendar, for I believe if we do
these two things, faithfully and well, the Holy Ghost will direct us to do the other needful things that will
lead us to what matters most.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">These two righteous actions are talked about over and over.  I am afraid at times we turn off
the invitation to really faithfully incorporate them into our lives.  Too often we are like Naaman who was
upset and insulted when told to bath in the dirty Jordan river to rid himself of leprosy and chose not to
comply until those who cared encouraged him.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I believe personal prayer and personal scripture study are two of the 
		<span style="text-decoration: underline">essential</span> things Elder
Scott was talking about.  Personal prayer and scripture study will keep us on the right track.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let us not drag our feet like Naaman.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Are you having regular, meaningful personal prayer?  I hope you can say a resounding, yes! 
Personal prayer keeps us close to our Heavenly Father and heading toward our fence post.  It is easy
to pray when we feel comfortable in our relationship to Heavenly Father.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Bible Dictionary explains (page752):</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God (namely, God
is our Father, and we are his children), then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive on
our part.  Many of the so-called difficulties about prayer arise from forgetting this relationship. 
Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into
correspondence with each other.  The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to
secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are
made conditional on our asking for them.  Blessings require some work or effort on our part
before we can obtain them.  Prayer is a form of work, and is an appointed means for obtaining
the highest of all blessings.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Jesus taught us how to pray, He gave us the Lord's Prayer.  He prayed as an example for us. 
We can read the prayer of the resurrected Savior in 3 Nephi 19 beginning in verse 19.  Twice in this
chapter He expressed gratitude. He thanked the Father for giving the Holy Ghost to His disciples and
for purifying them.  When we spend much of our praying time naming our blessings, our days will be
filled with gratitude.  And of course we need to plead for help in our personal lives and for our friends
and family.  We know that Jesus prayed for others and we know that the Savior prayed for help for
himself, that the cup might pass from Him, but He and His loving Father knew what had to be.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The scriptures remind us again and again to ask and it shall be given.  Heavenly Father has so
many blessings available for us, waiting only for us to ask.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In Matthew 7:7-11 we are instructed to ask for what we need and that a loving Heavenly
Father will give good things to them that ask.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened
unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that
knocketh it shall be opened.  Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he
give him a stone: or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?  If ye then, being evil, know how
to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give
good things to them that ask him?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">At times the answers to our pleadings come more slowly than we want, and at times the
answers come quickly.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Several years ago our family was serving a mission in England.  Ed was the president of the
England London South Mission.  Our three youngest children accompanied us.  After our first year in
England, our son Cory returned to Provo to finish his senior year in high school.  Cory's life was taken
in a car accident shortly after he returned home.  We were given permission to return to Provo for
Cory's funeral, then we returned immediately to England and our mission responsibilities.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It was a difficult time.  I missed everyone in our family.  A few weeks after our return to
England we received a letter from our daughter Kelly.  She had included pictures of her children.  It
was so good to see their faces.  I paused at that moment and offered a silent plea, "Heavenly Father, I
wish you could send me a picture of Cory."  In the next few days a letter arrived at the mission home
from a young man from our ward.  He had befriended Cory during Cory's year in England.  He
explained that he had felt a strong impression that he needed to write and tell us what a good influence
Cory had been to him.  He told of his recent desire to serve a mission because of Cory's example.  It
was a tender letter and touched my heart. I thanked Heavenly Father for sending me such a beautiful
picture of Cory.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Heavenly Father loves us.  He will take care of us in the best way.  Please acknowledge His
loving kindness, ask for his help, and listen to His answers.  He will help you stay focused on what
matters most.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Another essential action that will keep us moving in the right direction is to hold to the iron rod,
the word of God.  Are you making time in your busy schedules for daily personal scripture study
including the study of our prophets' messages? Again, I hope you can say a resounding, yes!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Several years ago I traveled to Declo, Idaho, to speak at a Young Women camp.  While I was
there, the young women participated in an iron rod experience.  When it got dark the young women
were taken in groups and told to hold fast to the iron rod, which was a PVC pipe.  They were led along
a dark, narrow, steep trail.   I joined a group of young women and held to the rod.  A little girl who was
there for the evening with her father and mother held on behind me.  I could hear her little voice making
comments to her mother as we stumbled through the dark holding fast to the rod.  We stopped now
and then to witness a spotlighted scene.  One was a group of young people partying.  There were
definite signs of alcohol.  The young people in the scene pointed at us and laughed and called us "goody
goodies."  They urged us to let go of the silly rod and come and join them in their fun.  We held on
tighter.  We continued to move along the trail and viewed several other scenes until we came to a
grandmotherly lady who was holding a plate of cookies.  She said, "I have some delicious warm
chocolate chip cookies.  They are for you.  All you have to do is to let go of the iron rod for only a
minute and come and have one.  They are so good.<strong>"  </strong>The little girl behind me said, "I bet she's lying.  I
bet those cookies have raisins in them instead of chocolate chips."</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Later that night as I drove down the canyon with the little girl and her parents she suddenly
blurted out, "I'm not safe anymore."  I asked her why she wasn't safe.  She answered, "I'm not holding
onto the iron rod any more."  I put her parents on the spot as I asked, "Do you have family scripture
study?"  She told me they had it every morning.  "Good," I responded, "that means you're safe. 
Having scripture study is holding on to the iron rod."  She gave a relieved sigh and sat back in her seat.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In D&amp;C 11:22 we are commanded:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">. . . . Study my word which hath gone forth among the children of men, and also study
my word which shall come forth among the children of men, or that which is now translating,
yea, until you have obtained all which I shall grant unto the children of men in this generation,
and then shall all things be added thereto.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When we allow the Holy Ghost to help us, the scriptures will tell us all things what we should
do (2 Nephi 32:3).  The scriptures help us focus on what matters most. They give us direction on how
to get to our goal.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There are so many fun ways to study the scriptures.  You will learn something new every time
you read them.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">You might try purchasing several paperback copies of the Book of Mormon.  Read one
focusing on faith.  Mark all of the scriptures that apply to faith.  When you are finished start another and
mark scriptures on repentance, another and focus on examples of our Savior and Father's loving-kindness.  As you read the scriptures, you might pretend you are a part of the multitude.  How would
you have responded when the Savior fed you bread and fish when there was so little to begin with, or
when He raised Lazarus, or helped the blind man see?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As you read the scriptures, try to liken them to your life.  Read a few verses then write down
how you can apply that verse in your life.  Today I will . . . .</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Consider this scripture and how you might apply it. The experience described in Matthew
14:23-31 helps us understand how the distractions that take us away from our goal can put us in
danger. The Savior had concluded teaching and feeding the multitude and wanted to be alone.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray:
and when the evening was come, he was there alone.  But the ship was now in the midst of the
sea, tossed with waves; for the wind was contrary.  And in the fourth watch on the night Jesus
went unto them, walking on the sea.  And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they
were troubled saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.  But straightway Jesus spake unto
them, saying, Be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid.  And Peter answered him and said, Lord,
if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.  And he said, Come.  And when Peter was
come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.  But when he saw the wind
boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.  And
immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little
faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Do you have winds boisterous in your life?  What is drawing your attention away from what
matters most?  What can you do about it?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The scriptures that remind me that I am His child, His little girl, and that He is aware of me, are
a great comfort.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">D&amp;C 50:40-41 tells us:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Behold ye are little children and ye cannot bear all things now; ye must grow in grace and in the
knowledge of the truth.  Fear not, little children, for you are mine, and I have overcome the
world, and you are of them that my Father hath given me; and none of them that my Father hath
given me shall be lost.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Throughout the scriptures the Savior uses the comforting visual image of a mother hen gathering
her chicks under her wing, where they will be warm and protected.  In most of these scriptural
references the Lord expresses His desire to love and protect us, but we would not.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In D&amp;C 29:1-2 He invites us to do our part:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, the Great I Am, whose arm of mercy hath
atoned for your sins; Who will gather his people even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings, even as many as will hearken to my voice and humble themselves before me, and call
upon me in mighty prayer.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The third action I want you to identify is the feeling of inner happiness and peace that comes
from being righteous and heading toward what matters most. Righteousness should fill us with joy.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">In Isaiah 32:17 we learn:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and
assurance for ever.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To identify and feel these feelings of peace and assurance we need the Holy Ghost.  Each of us
has been given this miraculous gift at baptism.  If we, as Paul encourages in 2 Timothy 1:6-7, "stir up
the gift within us" by fearlessly living righteously and trusting in the whisperings of the Holy Ghost, we
will learn the truth of all things and feel joy, <strong>"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of
power, and love, and of a sound mind."</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We are so blessed to understand in part our Father's plan of happiness for us.  I hope right
now you are feeling really good about yourselves.  I hope you can say:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I know what's most important to me.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I'm on the right track.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And when you leave this building I hope you will feel the pleasure of our Father in Heaven.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Isaiah 55:12 says:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">For ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break
forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Listen to the trees.  They are clapping for you.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I pray you will be able to feel the loving approval of our kind Heavenly Father as you do your
best to identify and head toward what matter's most.</font></p>

<p>I have spoken on this campus several times through the years. Today I'd like to return to a
subject I treated some fifteen years ago. There are at least two reasons for indulging in
this repetition. First, I assume that outside of a few faculty and staff, none of you were
here then. Second, "appropriate music in our lives," continues to be a concern, and my
perspective on it has been enlarged through my experience. Unfortunately, the attempt to
identify specifically what music is "appropriate" usually deteriorates into a question of
what music is "good" and what music is "bad". This game has been played for centuries
and to my knowledge no one has given a conclusive answer. I promise you that this is not
going to be a tirade against the popular music of our day.</p>
<p>The humorous and sometimes sarcastic columnist Dave Barry made an observation that
goes something like this:</p>
<p> <i>	When it comes to matters of musical taste, everyone is entitled to his own
opinion-and yours is wrong!</i></p>
<p>In spite of the sad truth in his comment, there is a great deal of room for discussion on
this subject. Let's begin by considering what some the great thinkers have said about
music.</p>
<p>The Spanish cellist/composer/conductor and musical entrepreneur Pablo Casals was once
asked to explain the purpose of music. He answered that if he could do so with words we
wouldn't need music, implying that music affects us in ways beyond our left-brained,
cerebral capacity to intellectualize about it.</p>
<p>That music has inherent power is demonstrated in this seemingly simple statement by
Rudger Clawson, an early twentieth century Utah civic leader and churchman:</p>
<p><i>If you will show me the songs a people or a community sing, then I will tell you the
character of that community.</i></p>
<p>Even more explicit are the words of one of America's great composer/teachers, Dr.
Howard Hanson, who for many years was the director of the prestigious Eastman School
of Music:</p>
<p> <i>	Music is a curiously subtle art with innumerable, varying emotional
connotations. It is made up of many ingredients and according to the
proportions of these components, it can be soothing, or invigorating,
ennobling or vulgarizing, philosophical or orgiastic. It has powers for evil
as well as for good.</i></p>
<p>Since music apparently has potential for both good and evil, how can the average person
determine whether specific music is appropriate? James M. Whistler, while speaking of
the arts in general, observed that:</p>
<p><i>	Art happens-no hovel is safe from it, no prince may depend upon it, the
vastest intelligence cannot bring it about, and puny efforts to make it
universal end in quaint comedy, and coarse farce. This is as it should
be-and all attempts to make it otherwise are due to the eloquence of the
ignorant, the zeal of the conceited.</i></p>
<p>Well then, here we are. I, by virtue of my education, experience and supposed wisdom
should probably be in a better position than most of you to determine what music is
appropriate for life, but both Dave Barry and James Whistler raise questions not only
about my ability, but also about my right to make judgments for you. At the same time
Howard Hanson warns that the amorphis elements of this thing we call music are so
powerful that they can be either highly beneficial or terribly dangerous. The only
conclusion I can draw is that the evaluation of music's appropriateness is an individual
experience and must be approached with sincerity and honesty.</p>
<p>Evaluation implies exposure-exposure to lots of music of different genres and styles.
Some fundamentalist thinkers find danger in exposure, but I can't conceive of evaluation
without at least minimal exposure to the vast amount of music available in today's world.
I believe exposure is healthy, if well managed and thoughtful. In fact it is virtually
impossible to escape exposure to at least some music because of radios, televisions,
stereos, grocery stores, restaurants and elevators-and all this without any overt attempt to
participate in concert halls or other places where music is formalized. It is nearly
impossible to avoid exposure! If we can't avoid, or choose not to avoid exposure to
music, we must for our own protection establish a matrix for its conscious and
unconscious inclusion in our lives. One might think of this as a filtering system. And this,
for the most part, is an individual process.</p>
<p>Intellectually, depending on ones background, questions like these might be asked:</p>
<p>Is this music appropriate because it is well crafted-is it theoretically and
formally correct?</p>
<p>Is it appropriate music because it speaks to me, or because it has found a
larger audience?</p>
<p>Is it appropriate because it has a history that is associated with something
good and meaningful?</p>
<p>Or is its worth tied to an occasion or event of importance?</p>
<p>Or is it, as the Germans termed it, "gebrauch musik" that was written to
fulfill a particular purpose or need?</p>
<p>Is music inappropriate because it is badly crafted or because it doesn't
speak to me or to a larger audience?</p>
<p>Or does it contain inappropriate subject matter?</p>
<p>Does the arena of its presentation have any bearing on music's
worth?</p>
<p>For example, is it appropriate because the audience is made
up of effete composers, professors and critics, or is it
appropriate simply because the music has gained wide
acceptance?</p>
<p>How many of you feel capable of prosecuting this kind of evaluation?  Let's be honest!
Few of us intellectualize this much about the music to which we are exposed. Usually we
are either oblivious to it or we're reacting at an almost subconscious level.</p>
<p>In 1913 the musical climate of the city of Paris was torn by a serious artistic schism. For
several decades a group of French composers had attempted to de-emphasize the
traditional major and minor harmonies that had been the backbone of music for some 200
years. Conflicting opinions about new forms and styles generated lively debates among
musicians, in learned journals, in the public press, and even within audiences. The
introduction of a new Russian ballet by Diaghilev set to the music of Igor Stravinsky
resulted in one of the most scandalous opening nights in the history of modern music. The
combination of Stravinsky's avant guard music and the subjects portrayed in the dancing
assaulted traditional sensibilities so violently that people screamed, hooted and slapped at
each other. A near riot ensued. In fact considerable damage was done to the theater and to
some of its occupants. The event was considered by many in the audience as an attempt to
destroy the art of music. This avant garde music and dance, challenging for even the most
forward looking consumers of that day, was injected into an already divisive
philosophical arena causing it to explode. Today "the rite of spring" is considered one of
the masterpieces of so-called modern music and is often heard in orchestra concerts or in
dance theaters around the world. In 1913 the music was wrong for that time and that
place. It was simply out of context, like strawberry pie as an entree or filet mignon as
dessert. Both filet and pie are delicious foods if the context is right.</p>
<p>Here is another context. Some twenty years ago I programmed a little piece of Scottish
folk music for the broadcast of the Tabernacle Choir. The song "Loch Lomond" is much
beloved by Scotsman, but for reasons I didn't then fully understand. A few days after our
performance a Scottish friend called to tell me this story:</p>
<p>A ninety-five year old Scotsman had lain gravely ill for several days from the effects of
old age. He awoke unexpectedly one morning to the surprise of family members who
were attending him. Scarcely able to speak, he asked what day it was. When he learned it
was Sunday, he asked what time it was. When told it was almost nine-thirty, he smiled
and said, "Oh good! I haven't missed the Tabernacle Choir broadcast". The television was
turned on and he listened intently to "music and the spoken word". Near the end of the
program the choir began to sing "Loch Lomond". Now that's the context of this
performance, but you also need the context of the song itself to appreciate its
appropriateness. The song tells of two Scotsmen who are imprisoned in England. One is
to be released the next morning, but the other is sentenced to die for treason against the
crown. Traditional folklore contends that if a Scotsman dies while away from his
homeland, his soul returns to Scotland through the underworld. In anticipation of their
parting the man who is to die sings to his friend, "Ye'll take the high road and I'll take the
low road, and I'll be in Scotland afore ye". When the choir sang those words on that
particular morning, at that particular time in the life of an aging Scotsman, the old man
used the last of his waning strength to raise himself up on one elbow to sing vigorously
with the choir, "and ye'll take the high road and I'll take the low road, and I'll be in
Scotland afore ye". Then he lay down, went to sleep and was soon gone from this life.</p>
<p>Do you see the importance of the context here? What may have otherwise just been the
performance of a pretty little song became a poignant moment in time in the lives of an
entire family, simply because the moment and the medium came together to create a
meaningful context. In both these examples, "the rite of spring" and "Loch Lomond", the
music had less to do with the appropriateness of the outcome than did the circumstances
that created context.</p>
<p>Now we must ask the question, why does context make such a difference to the
appropriateness of a given piece, kind or style of music? The answer is rather complex
because we as human beings are complex organisms. To understand the affect of music
on this organism is to understand something about the nature of man as a species.
Philosophers and theologians have devised many theories. I'll outline just five of the most
obvious. As I discuss them be aware that these are the "Reader's Digest" abridged
versions of otherwise very complex models that attempt to explain the human condition.
Be aware, also, that I use the term "man" generically to include both male and female.</p>
<p>One school of thought contends that man is a bad-active being. This means that man by
nature goes about doing bad things unless something in his environment becomes active
to change him.</p>
<p>The opposite of this theory is that man is good-active; that he will do only good things
unless acted upon to do otherwise.</p>
<p>Then there are those who propose that man is by nature instinctive; instinctively impelled
to act on his environment in any way that seems appropriate to the occasion.</p>
<p>The Tabula Rasa or neutral theory proposes that man comes as a clean slate to be written
upon, making him a total product of environment.</p>
<p>The most commonly accepted theories propose that man is a dual being comprised of
mind and body. Some interpret the mind in this duality as the metaphysical or theological
spirit that has the power to exercise control over the body as it reacts to its environment.
Others say that the mind and body work in opposition, vying for control.</p>
<p>Whichever theory one accepts leads to the realization that environment plays an important
role in human behavior. This assumption leads to another important question. Through
what mechanisms do the myriad musical stimuli that exist in today's world affect us?</p>
<p>I believe that the human organism accepts music on at least four levels of consciousness.
Further, I suggest that you might consider these levels as tools for choosing appropriate
music for your lives.</p>
<p>First, the physical, visceral or gut level where the organs of the body simply react to
music in the same way an amoeba reacts to a chemical introduced into its environment.
This is a simple physical reaction that is largely controlled by basic instinct. In human
terms it might be characterized as a state of abandon with only the most fundamental
elements of the environment exercising any influence on the resulting behavior. For
example, consider the jerky, uncoordinated movements of a person under the influence of
alcohol or drugs. If one attempts to place a value on this level of reaction, it might be
considered hedonistic and self-serving. In an appropriate context, however, physical
reaction may be as benign as a toe tapping unconsciously to the rhythm of a march.</p>
<p>Second is the emotional level where we begin to incorporate the mind so that the body
responds with both physical and emotional reactions. Much has been written in recent
years of the heart as a sentient or feeling organ in addition to its instinctive physiological
functions. This implies that humans are by their physical nature "feelingful" beings that
can react either positively or negatively.</p>
<p>Next is the third or intellectual level where our full consciousness begins to analyze the
stimulus and exercise some control over our emotional reaction to it. Our cerebral
evaluation of the stimulus provides logical information about how to handle our
emotional reaction to it.</p>
<p>The fourth and final level is what I refer to as the spiritual level where all the previous
levels are synthesized. It is here, when a stimulus has been subjected to our physical, our
emotional, and our intellectual powers that we subject it to one final scrutiny. It is here
that our value systems come into play to mitigate the imbalances, the instinctive reactions
and the misconceptions we may have about the input. It is here that we manage the
stimulus with all the tools we have to determine its worth. In my opinion this is the level
where we are not only safest, but also where we derive the most benefit from the
stimulus.</p>
<p>Now, let's bring all this back to our subject, "appropriate music in our lives". I'd like to
offer an opinion. Remember this is only an opinion, but it is based on decades of thought
and experience. Music may be considered to be "bad" music when its inherent quality
and/or the context of its performance forces one to absorb it at too low a level, that is,
only viscerally or emotionally. Music may become more appropriate or move toward
being "good" when we as listeners subject it to scrutiny beyond the physical and
emotional levels to include our intellectual and spiritual powers. Music becomes
"appropriate to our lives" whey we discriminate between what the music is doing <u>for</u> us
as opposed to what it is doing <u>to</u> us. What does it cause us to think? What does it make us
feel? What kind of behavior does it encourage? If the answers to these questions are
negative then the music is not appropriate. If one is honest about putting the music to
which he or she listens through the filters of ones personal value system, a wonderful
leveling takes place. By making the issue personal instead of hiding it behind imposed
standards of social or artistic judgment, it becomes a much less argumentative issue. But
it's only fair to point out that the personal approach works only if the individual is honest
about the values he or she has espoused, considers the contexts, and admits that
sometimes one needs a little outside input to make proper judgments.</p>
<p>One more comment about context. Have you ever considered what the music you are
enjoying is doing to others? Are you interfering with the aesthetic space of a roommate?
Are your parents distraught with the decibel level, the distortion, or the subject matter
your music is flooding into their home, into their conscious space, into their decision
making processes? Perhaps you should give this some thought before you bless the
atmosphere with your choice of sonic serenity.</p>
<p>Granted, evaluating music is not an easy exercise. It requires a commitment of physical,
mental and spiritual energy. It requires the desire to find appropriate contexts. It may even
require, heaven forbid, a little more thought and education if we, and those for whom we
have responsibility, are to comprehend what music is really all about. Music has some
heretofore unknown and astonishing dimensions that are currently being explored through
the social and natural sciences. Accordingly, when we chose "appropriate music " for our
lives, I believe we must remember that music is not just entertainment, but a life force
that can enrich or degrade the quality of our lives in both dramatic and subtle ways. It
behooves us to give music more than physical, visceral or animalistic attention.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let's revisit Dave Barry's quote with a slight change in his rather brittle
perspective:</p>
<p><i>In matters of musical taste, everyone is entitled to his own opinion, and [it's just possible]
yours [may be] wrong!</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">It is an honor to represent the faculty today as I speak with you. They are a
wonderful group of people to work with - so caring and supportive. On behalf of
all the faculty, may I tell how much we love you? You bring great joy into our
lives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Another great source of joy for me is my family. I am happy to have my two
youngest children with me today, Caleb and Sarah. I guess they figured that if Dad
goes to their soccer games and band concerts, the least they could do is support
him as he gives the most nerve-wracking talk of his life! (Of course the fact that
they were able to get out of school to be here today had nothing to do with their
eagerness to come)! I'm proud of my oldest son, Spencer, who, like many of you,
is struggling to raise a little family while he goes to school and works many hours
a week. My wife, Carrie, always supports me in the things that matter most -- that
our family be together daily for family prayer and scripture study, and weekly for
family home evening, family council and family recreational activities. And she is
so good at being both a strict mother and a good friend for our children. But
another important part of marriage is that each spouse recognize each other's
individual gifts and talents, and support them as they share those talents with
others. Carrie is blessed with a gift of working with children one by one to help
them improve their learning skills, and that is what she is sacrificing today in
order to be here with us.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">I am grateful to my parents, who visited here during General Conference. While
they were here, I asked my Dad for a Father's Blessing. It made all the difference
in helping me prepare for this day.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">"...but that I might more fully persuade them to believe in
their Lord their Redeemer I did read unto them that which was
written by the prophet Isaiah; for I did liken all scriptures unto
us, that it might be for our profit and learning" (1 Nephi
19:23).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">I would like us to heed Nephi's counsel today, to liken passages of scripture unto us, both in
Isaiah and in the Book of Mormon. Let's start with a familiar verse from Isaiah chapter 53, verses
4 and 5. As we read these verses, think about how they apply directly to you.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000080">"Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem Him
stricken, smitten of God and afflicted.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000080">But He was wounded for <span style="text-decoration: underline">our</span> transgressions, he was bruised for <span style="text-decoration: underline">our</span> iniquities: the
chastisement of <span style="text-decoration: underline">our peace</span> was upon <span style="text-decoration: underline">him</span>; and with <span style="text-decoration: underline">His stripes we are healed.</span>"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Has he ever borne <span style="font-weight: bold">your grief</span> or carried <span style="font-weight: bold">your sorrows</span>?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Have <span style="font-weight: bold">you</span> ever felt <span style="font-weight: bold">peace</span> because he strengthened you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color:#000080">Have you ever been healed through the atonement of Jesus Christ?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">How long has it been since you've felt that healing power?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Now, please turn to <i>Isaiah 41</i>, and read with me a passage of scripture that inspired one of the
verses of the hymn "How Firm a Foundation".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000080"><i>"Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed; for I am thy God: <span style="font-weight: bold">I will
strengthen thee</span>; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand
of my righteousness."</i> When was the last time<span style="font-weight: bold"> he strengthened you?</span> (Isaiah
41:10)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Many of the devotional speakers this semester have warned of tough times ahead. How do we
cope? How do we handle it? We can't do it alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">I would like to speak today about how we deal with tough timers in our lives. I would speak of
the <span style="font-weight: bold">healing</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">strengthening</span> power of the atonement of Christ. I don't profess to have a
scholarly understanding of the power. But I know an awful lot about it because of the hundreds,
perhaps thousands of times that I have sought relief from the spiritual wounds I have received
through life. These wounds are often self-inflicted...sins I have committed, or things I should
have done that I left undone.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">More often they have come about as natural consequences of mistakes made, that perhaps don't
technically qualify as sins, but nonetheless hurt me or others in some way. Occasionally, the
wounds are inflicted by the words or actions of others, although I have learned that these wounds
are often made more or less serious by the way I chose to react to circumstances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Elder Bruce Hafen , former President of Ricks College, said this in a beautiful article in the April
1990 Ensign:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000080"><i>"The Savior's atonement is thus portrayed as the healing power not only for sin,
but also for carelessness, inadequacy, and all mortal bitterness. The Atonement is
not just for sinners.</i>" </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Boy, am I grateful for that! I may not be a telestial being, but I am far from celestial! My family,
friends and students can all testify of this! I am especially good at cluelessly making comments
that end up hurting someone's feelings. I can imagine the Holy Ghost thinking, " DOH! Shiley,
not again! Can't you ever think before you open your mouth!"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">But no matter how we try the Lord's patience...If we <span style="font-weight: bold">truly</span> come unto him with a broken heart
and contrite spirit...and follow his pattern for healing that we will discuss in a few minutes, the
next day, when a friend asks "How are you doing" We can genuinely say, GREAT!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Why does the Lord continue to heal us when it seems that for every step forward we take a half a
step back? Simple. He can't help it. <span style="font-weight: bold">He really Loves us.</span> He really cares. He understands what we
are going through. He wants to help. But he knows our heart. It must be sincere.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">About ten years ago, I was on a long flight from New York to Seattle. It was a half-empty flight,
and I had nobody sitting next to me...so I saw it as a great chance to catch up on my Book of
Mormon reading. I settled in to read the entire book of 3 Nephi.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">I had a powerful experience on that long airplane flight. I was totally immersed and involved in
the events that occurred. I imagined I was the prophet Nephi, and as a result, gained a whole new
appreciation of the Love of God. I began to understand more fully the pattern we must follow to
partake of the healing power of the atonement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">So will you go back with me to the meridian of time? In the first chapter of 3<sup>rd</sup> Nephi, the
unbelievers have set a date for all the believers to be <span style="font-weight: bold">executed</span> if the signs are not given that were
prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite. Imagine that you are Nephi, the son of Nephi, who was the
son of Helaman. You are now the spiritual leader of those who believe in Christ. You<span style="font-weight: bold"> love </span>your
people. Your faith has been unwavering, and it is unwavering still. You have had numerous
witnesses of the spirit that the Savior will indeed come. Yet you seek just one more feeling of
comfort and assurance...just one more confirmation that your faith will be made whole. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000080"><i>"And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon the earth,
and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people, yea, those who were about
to be slain because of their faith in the tradition of their fathers. </i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000080"><i>And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord all that day..."</i>  (3 Nephi
1: 11-12)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Now on the other side of the veil, it is time for the great Jehovah to say goodbye. In just a few
hours of earthly time, he will enter the body of a baby boy, and will experience the same need to
walk by faith as the rest of us. He was leaving to serve his mission.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">I can imagine our Savior spending a quiet evening with His Mom and Dad, Our Heavenly Father
and Mother. Then the Holy Ghost slips in the room.. "It's Nephi ..... its pretty urgent.....I think
you should take this one yourself."  The Father nods to the Son, and the great Jehovah takes time
out from his farewell to comfort and reassure his prophet.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000080"><i>"...and behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000080"><i>Lift up your head, and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on
this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world..."</i>  (3
Nephi 1: 12-13)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">"Hang in there, Nephi, I'm on my way."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">When you and I are at those critical points in our lives, where our faith is put to the test, He is
aware. He really loves us. He will respond when we cry unto him with all the energy of heart. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Now, let move ahead almost 34 years. The signs accompanying the death of the Savior have
come to the Americas. Terrible destruction in the form of earthquakes, floods, wind and fire have
devastated the earth and many of the Nephites and Lamanites have perished. Now it is dark. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Let's read in 3 Nephi chapter 9 what the Savior said to all the survivors in the land round about.
They were all hurting, all aching inside, yearning for their lost loved ones, terrified about what
the future might bring. They suffered from spiritual wounds and perhaps some physical ones, too.
No doubt some of them had lived very righteous lives, yet still suffered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Nephi, I imagine, was overcome with grief. He had tried so hard to share the gospel with his
brethren, but their hearts were hardened. And now, they were destroyed. Nephi knew the signs of
destruction meant the Savior of the world had been slain for the sins of the people. His faith in
the resurrection and atonement gave him hope, but still he was emotionally and spiritually
drained.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">3 Nephi 9:13 is a most important passage of scripture, because it gives the pattern to follow if we
would like to receive the healing power of the atonement of Jesus Christ...regardless of why we
are hurting.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000080"><i>"O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than they, will not ye
now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal
you?"</i>  (3 Nephi 9:13)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Wait a minute...these people were spared because they were more righteous. Yet the Lord
says...<span style="font-weight: bold">Return unto me.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">Repent of your sins. Be converted.</span> Do you think Nephi needed to be
converted?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Well, I would suggest that at a minimum, these three things should happen every week of our
lives, in preparation to partake of the sacrament. But it needs to be real, genuine. And honestly,
there are many times when I could not bear to wait until the Sabbath to be strengthened or to
have my wounds healed. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Do you remember a time you truly repented of something? Do you remember how it felt to be
forgiven. Do you understand what Isaiah meant when he said "with his stripes we are healed" ? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">I was just finishing my freshman year at BYU, way back in 1975. There were ten days left in the
semester when i was called to be a Stake Missionary. My senior companion, Elder Sorenson, and
I were asked to teach the gospel to Joseph Abel-Abia, a graduate student from Nigeria. We taught
him 7 lessons in 12 days. The Lord truly strengthened me those two weeks. I was somehow able
to complete all my term papers and final exams successfully. Fortunately, I had memorized the
missionary discussions earlier that year, by spending several hours every Sunday working on
them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Joseph Abia was full of faith and humility. He accepted the gospel without reservation. When I
asked if he understood that he would be unable to receive the priesthood, He replied that If the
church were true, who was he to question God? And if it were false, who cared what the church
believes? But then he replied that he knew it was true, and that he would just have to be patient
and wait upon the Lord. Little did we know...that President Kimball would receive the revelation
on the Priesthood just 3 years later.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Joseph set a date to be baptized one week after final exams. I stayed at the apartment of a friend
in Salt Lake while I awaited the baptism. I was there all alone all day long. I was reading the
Miracle Of Forgiveness by President Kimball...and you know what that means....Guilt trip time!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">I wanted to be completely clean and pure when I stood in the circle to help confirm Joseph a
member of the church. When the words</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">"Receive the Holy Ghost" were spoken, I wanted to be sure I was an open conduit for the spirit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Now lest you think I was some evil, corrupt kid, let me assure you....I lived the word of wisdom.
I lived the law of chastity. But there returned to my remembrance a terrible habit I had in junior
High and part of High School. I was the only guy who was a completely active member of the
Church in my grade. The guys I hung out with had the filthiest language imaginable, and
unfortunately, I picked it up. It was a Jekyll and Hyde thing. Never cussed at home, and of
course, never at church. I even managed to play church ball without letting too many bad words
slip. But at school....it was time for Mr. Hyde. Especially at Basketball games. I sat in the crowd
with my friends and let loose the most terrible stream of profanity whenever I disagreed with a
referee call. Now I had overcome that bad habit when I became truly converted to the gospel
toward the end of my junior year. ( OK, my wife will tell you I still disagree with the referee from
time to time, but It's always with clean language!) By the time I was a senior, I had totally
eliminated swearing from my vocabulary. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">I remember one of the cheerleaders was in the cast "the Fantastiks" with me - a Broadway
musical that we did at our High School. During the curtain call on closing night, she turned to me
and gave me a little peck on the cheek (Boy, for a guy who was the geek of the week, that put me
on cloud nine!) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Then she said, "I can't believe you are the same guy who used to yell those ugly, horrible words
at the basketball games...I hope you'll never change" It was like a kick in the stomach. And that
scene came back to me as I read the Miracle of Forgiveness. I realized I had never fully repented
of the sin of profanity. I had changed my behavior, but had not been healed from the spiritual
wounds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">I thought of all the people in the crowd at the basketball games who may have known I was
LDS....how could I represent the Lord on a mission having uttered such foul things? I began to
ache terribly, and for hours I pled with the Lord for forgiveness. I truly understood what Alma
meant when he said in Alma 36:21...<i>"there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were
my pains."</i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">But as I wrestled with the Lord, there came to me several things I could and must do to be healed.
I won't take the time to explain them all, but it had something to do with some sins of omission,
some service, and a few heart to heart talks with some of my old high school classmates that the
Lord told me I needed to ask for forgiveness... even those very friends I used to hang around. I
began to feel hope....and I cried out those same words that I had memorized as a freshman in
seminary....<i> "O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and
am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death." </i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">And you know what? Like Alma...I could remember my pains no more! My soul was filled with
joy as exquisite as was my pain. I understood why the angels cry "Hosanna" - for I floated about
the room crying out, Praise the Lord! And Thank You, Sweet Jesus!"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">With His stripes, I was healed. The chastisement 
of MY peace was upon Him. I will always remember that feeling. When I find 
myself feeling empty inside, it motivates me to seek the healing power once 
again</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Now in our sojourn on earth, we learn things line upon line. If we are prayerful, the Holy Ghost
teaches us when we are in need of the healing power of the atonement. His healing isn't only
reserved for things that require a massive dose of repentance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">As Elder Bruce Hafen said, our carelessness and inadequacies can get us into trouble....especially
in our relationships with our family and our roommates. In fact, I believe that the only way a
family can expect to stay together in today's environment is if they regularly seek the healing and
strengthening power in their marriages and families. Face it. Moms and Dads, husbands and
wives make mistakes. We aren't all experts at family relationships. But I have learned that if we
invite the Savior into our homes, his grace can make up for a lot of our weaknesses. His
strengthening power can help us get through trials that might ordinarily break up a home. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">We need the atonement to help us overcome our mistakes and inadequacies. Now and then, you
might get an ache in your heart that tells you that you need to be healed. You may have no idea
what's wrong. When you feel that void, that hollowness, get on your knees, perhaps for a very
long time. And the Lord, if you are sincere, will reveal unto you the source of the wound in your
heart. If you seek to understand, the spirit will teach you <span style="font-weight: bold">what </span>led you to make the mistake you
made, and teach you of <span style="font-weight: bold">changes</span> you need to make in your life to reduce the chances of making
the same mistake again. As you receive this revelation....you are once again converted. The Holy
Ghost testifies to you of the great love God has for you, ...and you will desire to do good
continually. If you follow through, you will feel his healing power. You are, at that moment, truly
a disciple of Christ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">The same process of Returning to Christ applies when we have cause to mourn, or are in need of
His peace due to turmoil in our lives. I know many of you are struggling right now...(or will be
tomorrow when you get your mid-term grades)! Maybe you are hurting because you just split
with your boyfriend or girlfriend. I know some of you have endured family tragedies recently. A
loved one just passed on to the other side. A brother or sister is in trouble or has gone astray.
When these things come our way, there is an aching in our hearts. We get on our knees, we plead
for guidance from the Holy Ghost, and we allow the Holy Ghost to teach us what we should do. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Maybe we are instructed to read certain passages of scripture, and liken them unto ourselves.
Maybe we are counseled to talk to a friend. Maybe we are told to give service to another. Maybe
we are told to forgive someone. Maybe..... we are simply held in the arms of the comforter. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">I saw a wonderful example of the healing power of the atonement in the life of a fellow
American a few weeks ago on TV. One of the TV news magazines was interviewing the wife of
one of the heroes who stormed the cockpit of United flight 93, which was apparently intended to
crash into our nation's capital. As I watched and listened to her speak of her beloved husband, I
marveled at how she could maintain her composure. There was obviously a lot of love in her
heart. I could see the light of Christ in her countenance, even through the television airwaves. I
knew her wounds had been healed through the atonement of Christ. I just knew He had borne her
grief and carried her sorrows. And uttered a prayer of thanks to Him for consoling her.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Now there is one last blessing of the atonement that I would like to address...it is the
strengthening power of the atonement. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">President Bednar has spoken to the faculty and staff about the need for us to call upon that
strengthening power...so that by the Grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we can fulfill the
great responsibilities placed upon us by his prophet as we re-think education here at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>Idaho.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">If you take a look at the teachers in our department for example...we are just a bunch of regular
people who love our students. None of us has ever taught at a University before! We are all
humbled by the call we have received to create learning opportunities that will give our graduates
an advantage as they enter the workforce and society. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">It is a great weight that has been placed upon us. It is as if we have been called upon to bench
press significantly more than we have ever attempted before. We try our best to prepare ourselves
before the lift with proper training habits, and we call upon the Lord for his help. Yet when we
attempt the lift, we find ourselves struggling, struggling with the weight only partway up. It
seems clear that we can't do it...that the weight will come crashing down around us. But just then,
the Lord extends his littlest finger, and gently, imperceptibly gives us just enough help to break
through and complete the press.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">As long as we continue to recognize the source of that strength....it will come to us again and
again when we need it the most. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">"I will strengthen thee. I will help thee...I will uphold thee by the right hand of my
righteousness"...or maybe the right pinky!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">As Elder Bruce Hafen said, </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000080"><i>"The Savior desires to save us from our inadequacies as well as from our sins....
The Lord will not save us in our sins, but from them. <span style="font-weight: bold">However, he can save us in
our inadequacies as well as from them</span>. A sense of falling short or falling down is
not only natural, but essential to <a name="LPHit404"></a>the mortal experience. But, "after all we can do,"
the Atonement can fill that which is empty, straighten our bent parts, and make
strong that which is weak."</i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Dear brothers and sisters...I testify to you that he will bear your grief. He will carry your sorrows.
You can have peace, because he will bear the burden with you. With his stripes, you can be
healed. And He will strengthen you, help you and cause you to stand, upheld by his righteous,
omnipotent hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">I bear witness of Jesus Christ. That he lives. That the healing and strengthening power of his
atonement are very real.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Brothers and Sisters, I have not seen Him, for I am not worthy. But, by likening the scriptures
unto myself, I have truly bathed his feet with my tears. I have felt the marks of the nails in his
hands and in his feet. I have tasted of that most precious fruit, and I know how much He loves
me. And I know how much he loves you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Please.. I beg of you. Return unto him, again and again., that he may heal and strengthen you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">In the name of Jesus Christ...Amen.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">In pre-mortality, the Lord specified a prime purpose for our mortal existence when he
said, "And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the
Lord their God shall command them" (Abr. 3:25).   Did you hear that?  The Lord said
"all things whatsoever [he commands us]."  I realize that I am reminding you of this in
the middle of a semester, when you are discovering new concerns every day.   An
approaching paper deadline, a neglected Church calling, a friend in need, a worried
parent, or slothful personal scripture study which appeared minor at the beginning of the
semester, but may now be catching up with you.  How do you know what to focus on?</font> </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Rest assured that I have not come here today claiming specific answers to your priority
woes.  I come with a far more valuable message.  The Lord has given clear direction to
help you find answers to these and even more important decisions that will shape your
future.   In numerous ways, the Lord has underscored the secret to setting priorities and
choosing wisely throughout our lives.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">God gave Moses ten commandments, but the <span style="text-decoration: underline">first</span> one was "Thou shalt have no other
gods before me" (Exo. 20:3).  Joseph Smith identified thirteen articles of our belief, but
the <span style="text-decoration: underline">first</span> one is "We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in his Son, Jesus Christ, and
in the Holy Ghost" (A or F 1).  Of all 613 commandments listed by Jewish leaders from
the law of Moses, Jesus identified "the <span style="text-decoration: underline">first</span> and great commandment" to be "Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind"
(Matt. 22:37-38).  Captain Moroni's people fought for many righteous causes, but the
<span style="text-decoration: underline">first</span> one listed on the Title of Liberty was:  "In memory of our God" (Alma 46:12).  The
ultimate destination attained by pressing forward and clinging to the iron rod in Lehi's
dream was the tree of life.  And what filled his soul with exceeding great joy when he
arrived at the tree?  Partaking of the fruit of the tree--the love of God.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">In recent times, a prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, taught the same truth.  "We must put God in
the forefront of everything else in our lives.  . . .  We should put God ahead of everyone
else in our lives.  . . . Why did God put the first commandment first?  Because he knew
that if we truly loved him we would want to keep all of his other commandments.  . . .
When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our
lives.  Our love of the Lord will govern the claims of our affection, the demands on our
time, the interests we pursue, and the order of our priorities"  (April 2, 1988).</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight:700"><font color="#000080">Scriptural Examples</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Examples are everywhere in scripture to show the blessings and opportunities available
to those who put God first in their lives.  Turn to Moses 5.  Scripture equally testifies to
the misery and wo that follow those who put anyone or anything else as a higher priority
than the Lord.  Remember Cain who once hearkened to the voice of the Lord as well as
to his brother Abel? (Moses 5:26).  The details are not given, but Cain submerged God in
his priority list.   In verse 18, we read, "And Cain loved Satan more than God."  At that
point, Cain would probably still claim he loved God--just not as much as Satan. After
that priority flipflop, his declaration, up in verse 16, "Who is the Lord that I should know
him?" is not a major leap.  Neither is his subsequent disdain for Abel, his alienation from
his parents, and his being shut out from God's presence.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">But the Adversary is not always so blatant.  He doesn't often insist that we put <span style="text-decoration: underline">him</span> first
in our loyalty.  Anything or anyone other than God as the primary object of our love will
suffice for the Evil One.   Such subtlety is apparent in a national Gallup survey that
considered beliefs of college educated Christians in comparison to responses of those
without college education on several religious topics.  The results showed that "college
graduates are about three times more likely than persons without college education to put
the Second Commandment (loving your neighbor) ahead of the First Commandment
(loving God)."  Notice what naturally follows those who take God out of first place,
according to the same survey.  "The better educated are also about three times as likely to
think it possible to be a true Christian without believing in the divinity of Christ" (Robert
Wuthnow, The Restructuring of American Religion, p. 169).</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">All too frequently in today's world, a "Christian" is defined on the basis of the horizontal
relationship between oneself and "neighbor" rather than the vertical relationship with
Deity.  In this distorted view of Christianity, our relationship with others becomes more
important than loving God, having faith in Christ, and being a devoted disciple of his
gospel.  If God isn't first, sooner or later he will simply be a nice embellishment to our
lives.  When we put God first, he will teach and empower us to love each other better,
even if our love is not understood at first by the recipient.  The trouble is too often we
ignore things that should be first in our lives and go after secondary things, thereby
losing both.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Consider an extreme case surrounding the Nephite army during Mormon's life.  They
chose to turn away from God, concluding their strength and savvy alone were sufficient
to defeat the Lamanites and retain their lands.  These godless Nephites identified their
purpose for fighting in Mormon 2:23.  Notice not only who is listed first in their cause, 
but who doesn't even make their list:  "they would stand boldly before the Lamanites and
fight for their wives, and their children, and their houses, and their homes."  While the
language is reminiscent of the Title of Liberty--clearly Captain Moroni also included
wives and children in their great cause--Moroni put God first.  Captain Moroni's army
remembered to pray, to heed the direction of righteous leaders, and they were victorious
in miraculous ways.  God actually fought their battles for them and preserved their
freedom, families, and homes.  To see a contrast, look in Moroni 9:18-19.  The army
during Mormon's time lost everything.  In fact, their families particularly suffered. 
Mormon noted the awful results:  "O the depravity of my people!  . . . they delight in
everything save that which is good; and the suffering of our women and our children
upon all the face of this land doth exceed everything" (Moroni 9:18-19).   Here were a
people who went after secondary things, setting God aside, and lost everything.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Follow me through another example--found in Matthew 15.  But this one shows the
blessings enjoyed by a family because God came first.  The Lord promised Abraham that
his gospel would go first to the children of Abraham, and from them to the rest of the
world.  Beginning with verse 21, we read of an encounter between the Savior and a
gentile woman from Syro-Phoenicia who pressed Jesus to make an exception to that
promise.  She knew who Jesus was (see verse 22):  "Have mercy on me, Oh Lord, thou
son of David."  She had a plea, not for herself, but for a beloved family member, "My
daughter is grievously vexed with a devil."  Her subsequent reaction to the Savior's
response indicates who came first in her life.  First the Savior ignored her by
"answer[ing] her not a word" and "his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her
away; for she crieth after us."  Next, Jesus explained to her, "I am not sent but unto the
lost sheep of the house of Israel."  Finally telling her in verse 26, "It is not meet to take
the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs."  He just called her "a dog!"  If you were in
her place, and your family came first in your life, how would you respond to the Savior's
apparent rebuff?  I would predict that you would be offended and march off in a huff,
concluding that YOU could find a solution for your family without CHRIST!  And what
would happen to your daughter?  What would happen to you?  But that is not the way this
gentile woman reacted.  She refused to be offended.  Rather, she continued to worship
him, communicating that she didn't expect the full feast, only a few crumbs which fall
from the table.  The consequence?  Her daughter was healed, and the woman was blessed
for her remarkable faith in Christ.  That does not infer that the woman would never
encounter hard times in the future.  Her own people may have commenced to persecute
her because of her interaction with this Jewish holy man.  But she had discovered the
power of faith in Christ, which would strengthen her in the face of any hardship.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Matthew recorded this incident in contrast to the Pharisees, who claimed to be teachers
for God.  These Jewish leaders were offended because Jesus did not require his disciples
to wash their hands before they ate.  They, who loved the praise of men more than the
praise of God, lost all.  The Syro-Phoenician woman gained more than she could have
ever imagined.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I would like to consider the principle of putting God first as it may apply in the lives of
LDS college students in the modern world--specifically in the areas of mission decision
and preparation, reverence for our bodies, and modesty.  I believe you could select any
current concern and apply the principle of putting God first to find clarity in what he
wants for you.  My hope is that these few examples will illustrate what I mean.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><strong><font color="#000080">Missions for Young Men</font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">To begin, how does putting God first in our lives clarify mission preparation for a young
man?  First, when he hears the living prophet in the Priesthood session of General
Conference say "missionary work is essentially a priesthood responsibility.  As such our
young men must carry the major burden.  This is their responsibility and their obligation"
(GBH, Oct. 1997), he does not see himself as an exception to that duty.  In fact, a young
man who puts God first takes prophetic precautions and warnings seriously.  Such young
men are humble enough to recognize that some pretty-fine potential missionaries before
them have ignored such warnings, thereby putting in jeopardy their ability to serve a full-time mission.</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">President Hinckley has given very clear warnings, which often include the plea to shun
pornography of any ilk.  To young men of the Church (that is not to say that young
women need not heed the warning), President Hinckley has said, "You live in a world of
terrible temptations.  Pornography, with its sleazy filth, sweeps over the earth like a
horrible, engulfing tide.  It is poison.  Do not watch it or read it.  It will destroy you if
you do.  It will take from you your self-respect.  It will rob you of a sense of the beauties
of life.  It will tear you down and pull you into a slough of evil thought and possibly of
evil actions.  Stay away from it.  Shun it as you would a foul disease, for it is just as
deadly" (Oct. 1997).   Certainly included in such warning are the pitfalls connected with
communicating with pornographic language in Internet chat rooms. Pornography makes a
mockery of our bodies, the marvelous gift that God gave to us.  I would hope that none of
us would ever buy that wimpy justification--"boys will be boys"--to excuse a "casual"
introduction to pornography, as though exposure to such filth is a rite of passage to
manhood.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">When you young men seriously commit to put God first in your life, you will experience
a reverence for acquiring knowledge by study and by faith that opens up opportunities
and a desire to continuously serve the Lord long after your full-time mission is
completed.  We need young men who are not only honest and kind when dressed in white
shirt and tie on Sundays, but respectful and honorable with family members in the
privacy of their homes and with co-workers when promotions and salaries are at stake. 
We need young men who not only know all the right answers on their religion exams, but
those who exemplify Christlike attributes when they are alone with a computer.  More
than looking slick on the outside, we need young men who reverence the Priesthood
because of their deep, abiding love for God that comes before anything or anyone else in
their lives.  We need young men, before and after they marry, who will not succumb to
fluttering eyelashes and enticing whispers that tempt them to relegate love of God and
spouse to a lower ranking than their loyalty to adventure.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><strong><font color="#000080">Missions for Young Women</font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">In many ways the mission decision is more complex for young women.  Prophets have
not given definitive directives for young women, generally, concerning the Lord's
expectations for full-time missionary service.  In fact, President Hinckley has stated that:
"the First Presidency and Council of Twelve are united in saying to our young sisters that
they are not under obligation to go on missions.  . . . Young women should not feel that
they have a duty comparable to that of young men.  Some of them will very much wish to
go. If so, they should counsel with their bishop as well as their parents.  If the idea
persists, the bishop will know what to do." (GC, Oct. 1997).  What I found most
interesting about this statement by President Hinckley was that he did not deliver it
during a Young Women or Relief Society general meeting, but during a general
Priesthood Session of conference where fathers, bishops and stake presidents would be in
attendance.  He explained that two of his granddaughters were currently serving missions
and specified how they decided to go:  "Speaking with their bishops and their parents,
they made their own decisions to go."  I love his answer!  Do you see what opportunity
this affords you, young women?  You get one of the finest laboratory assignments to
learn to put God first in your lives!</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I am certain my enthusiasm for this opportunity is based on my own experience.  As I
turned 21 years old, my bishop invited me to visit him in his office where he issued me a
call to serve a mission.  He said he felt strongly that the Lord wanted me to go.   When I
shared this news with my father, he was equally adamant, but 
	<span style="text-decoration: underline">against</span> me serving a
mission.  He reassured me that the Lord did not expect his daughters to go on missions. 
So what was I to do?  Should I side with my ecclesiastical leader or my father?  I
considered weaseling out of the controversy altogether, leaving my father and the bishop
to duke it out.  But I had this persistent, nagging feeling that I needed to find out for
myself.  I went to my knees and poured out my heart to God like I had never done before. 
I expected an answer by the time I stood up, but nothing came.  Weeks went by.  I tried
fasting--serious fasting--like I had never done before.  Still no answer.  Anyway that's
what I thought.  When I finally recognized the answer, I realized the Spirit had been
telling me what God wanted me to do all along the way; I simply hadn't known what to
look for.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">For me the answer was yes, serve a mission.  For many other young women, the answer
will be no.  Since there is not a right or wrong answer for young women and missions,
the issue is not whether you serve a mission or not, but whether you ask, receive, and do
what God reveals to you personally when that time comes in your life.  Once you know
how the Spirit communicates with you, you will be able to discern answers to prayer
when the issue is critical and your emotions are clearly involved.  Take for instance, if
and when you receive a marriage proposal.  I would hope for your sakes, young women,
you have had a clear experience of pouring out your heart to God and receiving his
answer BEFORE you have to ask him how to answer a marriage proposal.  You will find
it hard to put God first when you don't know how his voice feels.  In that case, you will
probably default to your emotions or the answer your boyfriend received to his parallel
prayer.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Once you young women know from firsthand experience that the Lord will reveal
answers to you for your life and for your responsibilities, and when you choose to put
him first in your life, God will be able to use you as that secret weapon Sister Sheri Dew
has been talking about.  You will not become permanently frustrated when events don't
unfold in life as you may expect.  You will discover relationships and opportunities to
serve in the most unusual places, becoming amazed at the way the Lord has prepared you
for them.  You will find confidence to search the scriptures and discover the doctrines of
the gospel that bring power and assurance to your own life and to your future children. 
We need young women who are not only articulate and eager to learn in their major
college courses, but young women who understand doctrine and testify of it when they
speak in Sacrament Meeting and teach Relief Society.  We need young women who not
only stand for truth and righteousness when they recite themes in church meetings, but
when their dreamy boyfriends invite them to lower those standards in a variety of
creative ways.  We need women who not only wisely detect pornography in popular TV
programs, movies, and women's magazines but shun them without flinching, without
reservation, and without apology.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Before Marjorie Pay decided to marry a young, returned-missionary named Gordon B.
Hinckley, she recognized who came first in his life. She reminisced:  "As we got closer to
marriage, I felt completely confident that Gordon loved me.  But I also knew somehow
that I would never come first with him.  I knew I was going to be second in his life and
that the Lord was going to be first.  And that was okay."  How many women would be
incensed to not be first on their man's list?  But Marjorie was actually encouraged!  She
said, "It seemed to me that if you understood the gospel and the purpose of our being
here, you would want a husband who put the Lord first"  (Biography, pp. 114-15).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><strong><font color="#000080">Health of our Bodies</font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">When we put God first in our lives, we see his gifts to us as more precious than anything
money can buy.  Take our bodies, for example.  We were created in the image of God. 
At the conclusion of the Creation, "God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it
was very good" (Gen. 1:31).  That includes each one of us.  Our bodies are priceless gifts
from him.  They are so wonderful that Satan doesn't get one--not now, not ever.  He is
miserable as a result.  And what makes him feel better about not getting a body?  When
for any reason we are miserable with our bodies.  When we mistreat them, despise them,
purposely malnourish them, or try to alter them in unnatural ways we show disdain for
God's gift to us.  Has Satan had success in this area?</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Among the commandments the Lord gave to the children of Israel was, "Thou shalt not
kill."  But that only suggests the "minimum standards of conduct," according to President
Spencer W. Kimball.  He explained, "It is not enough to refrain from killing.  We are
rather under solemn obligation to respect life and to foster it.  . . . We refrain from taking
harmful substances into our body.  Through wisdom and moderation in all things, we
seek good health and a sense of physical well-being" (GC, Oct. 1978).</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Furthermore (turn to D&amp;C 88:28), God has revealed that these very bodies will be
restored to us in the resurrection.  From this revelation given to Joseph Smith we read: 
"They who are of a celestial spirit shall receive the same body which was a natural body;
even ye shall receive your bodies, and your glory shall be that glory by which your
bodies are quickened."  Does knowing that you will have that very body for eternity alter
the way you care for your bodies here?  Does wanting to be physically fit so that you can
better serve God, whenever or wherever he calls, increase your ability to choose what is
good for your body?  Do the do's of the Word of Wisdom suddenly have greater
importance and power when you know God is serious about these bodies?  Does such
awareness suddenly ignite greater self-control to resist junk food and extreme diets? 
Does it confirm to you that the Lord will strengthen your resolve to achieve a healthier
lifestyle when your motive is grounded on faith in him?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">President Ezra Taft Benson observed:  "To a significant degree, we are an overfed and
undernourished nation digging an early grave with our teeth, and lacking the energy that
could be ours because we overindulge in junk foods.  . . . We need a generation of young
people, who, as Daniel, eat a more healthy manner than to fare on 'the king's meat'--and
whose countenances show it" (Teachings of ETB, pp. 476-77).</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Although the physical results may not be as immediately obvious as the "quick-and-dirty" diets, focusing on the proper "why" for a healthy body will provide long-term
benefits, which include--but are far from limited to--a better physique.  Improvements
in spiritual fitness:  faith, humility, and gratitude accompany such training.  In fact, Elder
John A. Widtsoe suggested:  "Were we more careful to obey the part of the Word of
Wisdom that deals with the 'do's' it might be easier to obey the 'don'ts'" (Conference
Report, Apr. 1926, p. 110).  On the other hand, if your first priority in physical health is
getting a body that will impress and astound your peers, you will be tempted to jump at
any trendy "miracle" technique, regardless of the cost to pocketbook and worse, to the
overall health of your body.  Only when we put God first can we wholeheartedly draw
upon his power to overcome our weaknesses and educate our desires.  In truth, his is the
only power that can make us conquerors.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><strong><font color="#000080">Modesty</font>
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">The manner in which we clothe that body provides another opportunity to show the Lord
that he is first in our lives.  I like the definition of modesty--dress or demeanor that does
not draw undue attention to one's self.  That would include caution toward extremes in
the unkempt look as well as the "costly apparel/fine-twined linen" look.  Since God
created these bodies in his image, they are beautiful and miraculous.  The world
professes that bodies increase in beauty when they are flaunted, exposed, and
embellished in ways that lead us to make fools of ourselves.   Such a perspective is
reminiscent of a Calvin and Hobbes cartoon I saw years ago.  Young Calvin comes home
from school all down in the mouth.  His mother meets him at the door with the inquiry,
"What went wrong at school?"  Calvin's answer:  "What good does it do to have
Tyrannosaurus-Rex underpants, if no one gets to see them!"  Trendy, revealing styles of
the world reflect the same first-grader mentality:  What good does it do to have a great
body if I keep it covered and no one notices it?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Your own President David A. Bednar expressed it so well:  "It is interesting to me that
these trends of the world frequently promote a false individuality that is nothing more
than a superficial and curious outward conformity.  True individuality is the product of
spirituality and not a function of trinkets or ornaments attached to or hanging from parts
of our body.  The spiritual basis of individuality is never more evident to me than when I
worship in the house of the Lord and everyone is dressed in similar white clothing,
looking essentially the same.  In that setting, no fads or fashion statements are necessary"
(Ensign, September 2001, p. 20).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">When God comes first in your life, you don't need a detailed handbook to tell you
specifically which articles of clothing are immodest on your body.  You realize that you
already know the signs:  you walk in a room and everyone seems to react to your attire;
you find yourself self-consciously pulling or tugging at your clothes; or you instinctively
wish you had brought an additional layer of clothing to cover you.  Trust those spiritual
inclinations and alter your wardrobe accordingly.  We need young men and young
women whose appearance reflects a humble assurance that God lives and guides them.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Because of the Fall, the Lord provided a covering for Adam and Eve's mortal bodies that
typified his atoning sacrifice.  With that covering, the Lamb of God promised that he
would come in the meridian of time to shed his blood, and thereby provide protection,
empowerment, and cleansing from sin throughout our mortality and an exalted life for all
eternity.  When we choose to properly cover our bodies, we are invited to bear witness of
the Atoning One, rather than draw attention to ourselves with a non-verbal proclamation
of vanity, neediness, or loss of self-respect.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><strong><font color="#000080">Application to all God's Commandments</font></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">The answer to frustrations about what we should be doing--today and next week and
next year--lies in where God figures in our lives.  By changing our focus from seeking
our peer's praise to finding acceptance in God, our capacity and wisdom will increase
enabling us to follow all that God commands.  Such nagging thoughts as, "I don't think I
can ever make it" or "Have I done enough?" will be replaced with greater desires to serve
God out of love for him.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Remember the "rich young ruler" who asked the Savior what he needed to do to receive
eternal life?  In Matt. 19:17, Jesus told him, "Keep the commandments."  The next verse
records the young man's reply, "Which?" He seems to anticipate some minor thing he yet
needed to do to be finished with that obedience-requirement.  After Christ specified
necessary commandments, the man proudly responded in verse 20, "All these things have
I kept from my youth up:  what lack I yet?"  It is difficult to imagine anyone presuming
to stand before the only perfect man who has ever lived on this earth and brazenly
declare, "I have obeyed all the commandments--is that all I have to do?"  One wonders
what genre of checklist-obedience this seemingly arrogant young man had adopted to
satisfy his own definition of discipleship.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">By contrast, when love of God comes before checking off commandments, humility and
gratitude accompany our sincere efforts and we are empowered beyond our natural
ability to "go and do" what the Lord commands.  Furthermore, when God is first, his
commandments cease to be a burden because they actually "inspire" us (D&amp;C 20:7). 
From that new perspective, we will discover the principle behind the cautions and
commands, and experience a new level of joy as we seek to obey.  We will find multiple
ways to become witnesses for God at all times, and in all things, and in all places, far
beyond a full-time mission.  We will actually choose behavior and dress that doesn't
bring undue attention to ourselves but will point to the One who makes all hope possible. 
We will gladly choose healthy food and exercise so that we can call upon God, with faith,
to grant us spiritual and physical strength necessary to obey all his commands.  In our
prayers, we will experience a powerful communication with God and not "vain
repetitions."  Our scripture study will forget about measuring number of pages or minutes
because it begins to illuminate our hearts and minds to the sweet doctrine of the Gospel. 
Our relationships with others will be more genuine and satisfying.  Education will have
greater meaning and even a sense of divine purpose.  Opportunities to bring others closer
to the Savior will occur frequently and naturally.  As Elder Russell M. Nelson taught in
our last General Conference:  "Regardless of gender, marital&nbsp;status, or age, individuals
can choose to link themselves directly to the Savior, hold fast to the rod of His truth, and
lead by the light of that truth. By so doing, they become examples of righteousness to
whom others will want to cling."&nbsp;</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Do you see what happens?  Just what President Benson promised:  when we put the first
commandment first, we will want to keep all of his other commandments; all other things
will fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives; and we'll know how to wisely use
our time and order our priorities.   When we put the first commandment first, whatever
comes second will often change.  When we put God first, whatever comes second will
always be right.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Will you trust what prophets have testified from the beginning?  "Men and women who
turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives
than they can" Pres. Benson declared.  "He will deepen their joys, expand their vision,
quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings,
increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, raise up friends, and pour out peace. 
Whoever will lose his life in the service of God will find eternal life" (Teachings, p. 361).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I bear witness of him who knows all, and sees all, and cares deeply about what happens
to each of us.  May our faith in him increase so that he is truly first in our lives, enabling
us to "obey ALL things whatsoever he commands."</font> </span></p>

		2001</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000080">With Sister Hafen here today, I've been thinking of a moment when I was president of Ricks
College and we went with the basketball team to Kansas for the national tournament.  The team did
very well that year.  As they were playing in the semi-final game, our little group of Ricks fans were in
the big arena cheering the team on.  Our cheering section included a few local Church members and
some local people who had just been attracted to the team during the tournament.  At half-time, a
woman came to talk to us.  She said, "I've been watching you people cheer."  She turned to Marie and
said, "I have to know which one of those boys on that Ricks basketball team is yours, because I've
never seen a mother cheer so hard.  Which one is it?  We want to cheer for him too."  As Marie
wondered what to tell her, I said, "They're all hers."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I'm grateful Marie is here today.  She still feels like a cheerleader for all of you.  Especially
given what I want to talk about with you today, I'd like to ask her just to say hello to you, then I'll go
ahead.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">(Marie K. Hafen)   It's true.  I'm sorry.  I still feel like you're all mine, even though this is a new
generation.  But seeing your shining faces makes me think of a scripture.  "And if your eye be single to
my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that
body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things." (D&amp;C 88:67)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Now that doesn't mean you are going to get an A on your English test or your biology test next
week, but you will be comprehending things of much more importance. And I have seen the light in
your faces in the classrooms here, and in missionary zone conferences.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I have had the wonderful opportunity of teaching at both Ricks (BYU-Idaho) and BYU-Provo
part-time, including a class this semester.  We are writing based on the Book of Mormon as the text.  I
have seen the light grow in my students' eyes.  I want to tell you about two students.  One is a young
man who wrote in one of his papers that when he was in high school he made a few mistakes.  He
woke up one morning with a terrific headache-and I don't have to tell you what that was from.  But he
said, "I asked myself, 'What you are you doing to yourself/'" Then he said, "I realized I was wrong,
and I changed my life."  He repented in the very positive way that repentance means to me-to change,
to turn around.  And I could see in his face the light that means he has felt the forgiveness that comes
through the atonement of Jesus Christ.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The second student I would like to tell you about is me.  I feel like I continue to be a student of
the Book of Mormon, a student of how to express what it means to me to be a disciple of Jesus Christ. 
I want to increase that light within me so that my eye can be single to him, so that there is eventually no
darkness in me.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">One other verse from the Book of Mormon has come to mean more and more to me, teaching
us that the light within us grows as we become more like him: "For we labor diligently to write [and to
help others that we love to write], to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ
and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do." (2
Nephi 25:23)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We work to keep our eyes single to God.  He helps us to increase our light to be more like him. 
I would say it one more time.  We know that it is by grace that we are saved, as we do all we can.  He
is with us, I testify, every step of the way as we increase the brightness within us and strive to help
others increase their brightness.  I testify that he knows each one of you, that he loves each one of you,
and that your families are important.  Elder Hafen will be talking about families this afternoon.  Without
the atonement, our families could not be together forever.  I testify to that in the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">(Elder Hafen)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Speaking of Kansas,<strong> </strong>a young man from Kansas married a young woman from California.  The
wedding was in a Kansas churchhouse.  As the bride and groom dashed happily out of the church, their
friends waved and laughed and threw wheat over them.  Ducking her head, the bride asked her new
husband, "Why are they throwing wheat at us?"  Said the groom,  "We just got married!  They're
happy for us!"  Still puzzled, the bride said, "You don't throw <em>wheat</em> at newlyweds, you're supposed
to throw <em>rice.</em>"   "Honey," the groom explained, "This is Kansas--it's the wheat state!"   "Well," she
said, "then I'm sure glad I didn't marry somebody from <em>Idaho</em>."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, you wonderful souls, I want to talk with you today about fulfilling your
dream of family life-your own marriage and your own family.  Taking a phrase from the Thanksgiving
hymn we just sang, let's talk today about "The Joy of Human Love."</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Hollywood has recently found a theme the public loves-happy-ending stories about angels, and
about life and love after death.  Awhile back, some of my children took me to see "What Dreams May
Come."   In this movie, Robin Williams dies in an accident, then finds his wife and children in a very
colorful "heaven"-but only after going through a very ugly "hell" to save his wife.  The film's hope is that
love and family life can exist beyond death.  That is a message most people today want to believe is
true.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Yet at the same time, ironically, many families today are dysfunctional.  As President Hinckley
has said, "The family is falling apart.  Not only in America, but across the world."<a href="#N_1_"><sup> (1)</sup></a>  One third of all
babies in the U.S. are now born outside of marriage and over half of all new marriages will probably
end in divorce.  No wonder Hollywood is looking for happy endings.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Is eternal family joy possible, or is that just the stuff of dreamy movie plots and Church videos? 
Even some LDS young people these days despair of seeing their family dreams come true.  One
returned missionary told his stake president that he'd seen so many family disasters, he didn't dare get
married unless someone could guarantee that his family would not fail.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The children's song, "Follow the Prophet," describes today's confusion: "Now we have a
world where people are confused.  If you don't believe it, just watch the news."  And the song's
answer: "Follow the Prophet-he knows the way!"  The Prophet has now issued the Family
Proclamation, which teaches us how our families really can live happily ever after.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Restoration's doctrine of eternal families is a light in a very dark world-and the light is
beginning to be noticed.  Consider how some thoughtful people from outside the Church view the LDS
family across three dimensions.  With a nod to Charles Dickens, let's call this Family Future, Family
Past, and Family Present.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">First consider Family Future.  When I was teaching law at BYU-Provo a few years ago, I
received a phone call from Kenneth Woodward, the religion editor of<em> Newsweek</em> magazine.   After he
had asked some questions about family law issues, he wondered if I were a Mormon.  When I said yes, 
he said, "I see where the Mormons got some pretty good play in the new book on heaven out of Yale."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Not knowing that Yale was all that much into books about heaven, I asked him to tell me more. 
He said the book, <em>Heaven: A History</em>, was written by two non-LDS scholars and published by Yale
University Press.<a href="#N_2_"><sup> (2)</sup></a>  It traces the history of beliefs about heaven in Western culture.  It concludes by
reporting how people, and religions, think of heaven today.  The authors found that the public feels a
widespread hunger for heaven - and families in heaven. The majority of Americans still believe in life
after death, <em>and</em> in "the eternal nature of love and the hope for heavenly reunion" with their families. 
Yet, most Christian churches offer little  response to this public yearning. Rather, today's "ideas about
what happens after death are only popular sentiments and are not integrated into Protestant and
Catholic theological systems."<a href="#N_3_"><sup> (3)</sup></a> </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Then the authors describe one "major exception" to this religious vacuum about heaven --  "the
theology of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."  They describe our teachings about
temples and eternal marriage, concluding that "the understanding of life after death in the LDS church"
offers the most complete concept of heaven in our day.<a href="#N_4_"><sup> (4)</sup></a>   What a discovery!  Most people today long
for eternal families, and the Restoration fulfills that longing better than any other known set of ideas.  I
wish the whole world could see a video with the student body of BYU-Idaho singing the glad news:
"Families can be together forever."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sometimes I have been assigned to interview people who earlier made mistakes that led to the
loss of their priesthood and temple blessings, and now they want to come back into full church
fellowship and reclaim their blessings.  In these very tender conversations, I often ask, "What motivated
your desire to come back?"  Most of the answers are variations on a central theme.  That theme was
illustrated by one man who had been working as a lonely sheepherder after being separated by his
wrong choices from his family.  He said he'd sit alone and look into his campfire each night, thinking
about his wife and his children. He would say to himself, over and over,  "I want to be with my family,
eternally, more than I want anything else."  That powerful vision of his Family Future gave him the
courage and strength to repent and return.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Next consider Family Past.  I was present when the Church gave a large personal family history
to the Prime Minister of Australia,  John Howard.   The PM, as the Aussies call him, was delighted to
learn all about his ancestry.  Then he asked, "Do I correctly understand that your Church has the largest
collection of family history records in the world?"  We gladly said yes.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">We also told him that the Church has now made many of those records  freely accessible on the
Internet through FamilySearch.org.  People everywhere feel a growing hunger to understand themselves
better by understanding their ancestral "roots."  Church members pursue these roots and records partly
to know their ancestors,  but also to help fulfill their dream of a forever family by building eternal bonds
across the generations.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">The spirit of Family Past in our doctrine also includes our appreciation for Adam and Eve, our
first mortal parents.  Our understanding of Family Past reaches even further back, prior to Eden, prior
to the earth's creation--to our family relationship with God himself.  Through the Restoration, we know
that each of us lived in a pre-earth life with God, the literal father of our individual spirits.  I recently met
a bright and vivacious new Church member from Illinois whose discovery of the doctrine of our pre-mortal life was the turning point in her conversion.  These ideas rang so true and meant so much to her
that she just kept telling everybody, "We lived before!  We lived before!"</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This is why we pray to God as "Heavenly Father," and why we refer to one another as "brother"
and "sister."   Our Father gave us the opportunity of coming to earth to develop through demanding
experience the personal qualities we need to live permanently with him.  Then, as Sister Hafen said, the
atonement of Jesus Christ makes it possible for us, if we are faithful, to live eternally "at-one" with our
Heavenly Father and with our mortal families.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">The most beloved of all LDS children's songs captures this idea in child-like clarity:   "I am a
child of God."  A few years ago in Australia's Northern Territory, one of the most remote places on
earth, I visited the Church's only branch where all of the members are Aboriginees.   Because the
branch is so isolated-500 miles from its District priesthood leaders-I wanted to know what the
members there were learning about the gospel. On impulse, I asked all the children if they could sing, 
unrehearsed,  "I Am a Child of God."  I can still feel the assurance I felt then as they gathered and sang
every word with earnest smiles, their faces full of light. "Teach me all that I must do, to live with Him
someday." I sensed that they were on the homeward spiritual path.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">As the song teaches, our earthly home is an extension in both purpose and pattern of our pre-earth home.  And it prepares us for our eternal home.  This  "great plan of happiness" is all about
marriage and life in families.  As Elder Dallin H. Oaks said,  "The fulness of eternal salvation is a family
affair . . .  The gospel plan originated in the council of an eternal family, it is implemented through our
earthly families, and it has its destiny in our eternal families.  The mission of our Church can be
expressed in terms of the mission of the family."<a href="#N_5_"><sup> (5)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This understanding places the Family Present-our mortal family and our own marriages- within
the <em>eternal</em> perspective of a Family Past and a Family Future.  This context makes our understanding of
our earthly families like the second act in a three act play. Act one is our pre-earth life in the family of
God, act two is our current mortality, and act three is our eternally sealed families after death.  Without
the vision gained from acts one and three, the second act could seem either too short, too long, too
hard, or too confusing.  When we do know about all three acts, act two acquires an infinite significance.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I've sometimes been asked by people of other faiths, why is it that so many LDS  families seem
to thrive, even in this age of family decline?  We clearly have our share of troubled homes.  But they still
ask,  "How do you explain the amazing <em>confidence</em> in marriage and family life that I see in the
Mormons I know?"   A law  professor from Tokyo visited  the U.S. to explore his concerns about the
damaging effect of American culture on Japanese family commitments.  He told me that the two most
corrosive forces in his culture are the immorality in American TV and movies, and the self-centeredness
of American law.  He said, "You beat Japan in the second world war.  Do you have to inflict your
movies and your laws on us too?"</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Then, after he'd been on the BYU-Provo campus several days,  mixing in the dorms with
students, this  professor said, "You must tell me about these students and their families.  This campus is
an island of hope in the land of the apocalypse.  What is the secret behind all the shining eyes?"</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Questions like these can't be fully answered in social or behavioral terms, because Act One
and Act Three of a Latter-day Saint's family understanding make Act Two - Family Present -- more a
matter of religion than of mere social behavior.  When we consider LDS attitudes toward marriage and
children, we are talking primarily about Church doctrine. To paraphrase President Boyd K. Packer,
this is a case where our understanding of the doctrine will influence our behavior much more than talking
only about behavior will influence our behavior.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Those who lack eternity's doctrinal perspective on time and on human relationships can too
easily cave in to the pessimistic assumptions of believing that "there's no tomorrow."   King MacBeth's
chilling speech upon hearing of Lady MacBeth's death captures the cynical attitude that sees Act Two
as the entire play: "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,/ Creeps in this petty pace from day to
day,/ . . . / And all our yesterdays have lighted fools/ The way to dusty death./ Out, out, brief candle./
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,/ that struts and frets his hour upon the stage,/ and then is
heard no more./  It is a tale told by an idiot,/ full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When I hear that phrase in a more modern context, "there's no tomorrow," I remember a song
that was popular during my high school days.  I still remember the dance and the girl my memory
associates with the song.  I can even remember the words. "There's no tomorrow, when love is new. 
There's no tomorrow, for lovers true.  So kiss me, and hold me tight.  There's no tomorrow, there's
just tonight."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">But brothers and sisters, there IS tomorrow.  Thank heaven, literally, there is tomorrow. And
because there is tomorrow, all our yesterdays have meaning and all our dreams have hope.  That is why
true love is never wasted, and our sacrifices for the sake of eternal love signify everything.  We do not
strut and fret for but an hour on life's stage, and our candles do not go out by darkness.  As the poet
wrote, "Death is not an extinguishing of the light.  It is a putting out the lamp because the dawn has
come."   As we truly yearn for Family Future and Family Past, then, everything about Family Present
matters more.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I know it isn't easy to translate these principles into a tidy, daily reality, because mortal family
life is by its nature a continual struggle between the ideal and the real.  But if the home from which you
come is anchored in the gospel, you are very fortunate, although  even temple-married families (in case
you haven't noticed) aren't perfect.  As Mary Hales said, "If you think you've seen a perfect family,
you just don't know them well enough."  Still, if your home often knows the warm feelings of love and
laughter, and if your family is trying-even most of the time-to have family prayer, home evening and
honestly shared gospel experience, you are learning the pattern for happiness.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Many years ago when our family was young and we lived in Rexburg,  our seven children were
sometimes almost too "active in the Church."  I would often remember the words of our bishop from a
few years earlier.  He would shake his head and smile at our lively little crowd trying to hold still on a
Church bench and say, "the Hafen children - curtain climbers, rug rats, and house apes!"   Your family
might seem that way sometimes.    We can't help seeing each other at our worst, and our best, in the
closeness of family life.  In the worst moments, we may wonder how we can keep living with each
other.  But in the best moments, we can't really imagine living without each other.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the basement of our Rexburg home on the night before our oldest son, Jon, left for his
mission, we pulled together  "the family slide show," the best and funniest pictures of our family over
twenty years.  At the end of the show, we knelt in prayer together, and spontaneous tears flowed.  No
more curtain climbers and rug rats-just imperfect young men and women, and their imperfect parents,
who felt an honest love for each other.  And those feelings have kept growing, as the constant stretching
from family reality toward family ideals gives each of us the desire to live worthy of belonging to each
other in time and in eternity.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">I realize that, for some of you, your family life is torn.  
		<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In<em> Les Miserables</em>, Fantine sings of her
childhood dream "that love would never die."  Then she cries, "But the tigers come at night, and tear
your [dreams] apart."  I know how hard family problems can be.  I have seen plenty of tigers tear at
people's dreams. </span></font></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I also know some valiant Church members who have absorbed the pain of their own family
trauma rather than passing it on to others.  They "renounce [family] war and proclaim [family] peace,
and seek diligently to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers."  (D&amp;C 98:16) Many of you are
such a powerful force for good in your families, that you are acting as Saviors on Mt. Zion for them by
your example of love and forgiveness.   Emulating Jesus,  you often give sweet commitment in exchange
for bitterness.  How I admire you.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Whatever our circumstances, we all feel the longing to belong in eternal unity with a loving
family.   The power of hanging on to that feeling as a deep, personal vision is very strong.  The mental
image of his wife gave Viktor Frankl the strength to survive the agonies of</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">a Nazi concentration camp: "As we stumbled on for miles, dragging one another onward," he wrote,
"my mind clung to my wife's image. [H]er look was more luminous than the sun. For the first time in my
life,  I grasped the greatest secret that human poetry and thought have to impart: The salvation of man is
through love."  Therefore,  "He who has a <em>why</em> to live for can bear with almost any 
		<em>how</em>."<a href="#N_6_"><sup> (6)</sup></a>   His "why"
was the vision of one day reuniting with his wife  and his family.  Full of such hope, he could live with
the awful "how" of imprisonment.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">A young friend of ours named Karl walked joyfully out of the temple after his wedding.  He said
he had first met Kate, his bride, when he was only 14.  "That's when I first saw 
		<em>the vision</em>," he told us,
smiling at Kate in her white dress.  "But I wasn't worthy of her, so she never knew how much I
admired her.  Then after years of school, seminary, and a mission, I saw her again.  And this time I was
ready."</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Now what must you DO to make your family dreams become a reality?  Someone once said
that a vision without work is dreaming, and work without a vision is drudgery.  But vision and work
together bring joy and fulfilment.  Some young Latter-day Saints may believe in the vision of a happy
eternal family, but they aren't willing to do the work and pay the price to fulfill the dream.  Without the
heavy lifting-the work--of preparation and obedience, even a wondrous vision of a celestial family is
just dreaming.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">You are right now in the most crucial years of your life regarding the WORK of making your
family  dreams come true.  You will be confronted this year, maybe this week, with some frank realities
that will force you to decide how much your dream really matters to you.  Imagine with me a young
man your age whom I'll call Jared.   Jared's parents had tried to teach him the gospel in their home, but
as he got older they felt they hadn't reached him.  They dearly wanted him to gain a testimony, go on a
mission, and marry in the temple.  But Jared wanted to live his own life, and it bugged him that his
parents kept asking him about a mission.  He enrolled as a freshman in a state college far from home,
where he could be his own person and do his own thing.  He was tired of seminary and what he called
"cheesy Church kids."</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Jared loved the freedom of doing whatever he felt like doing. He got involved with the wrong
kind of  movies, music, dancing and girls.  His parents had taught him to make better choices, but he
was on his own, and he loved it.  Jared began hanging out with a very cute girl I'll call Stephanie.  Their
relationship got very physical, very fast, and Jared found that exciting.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">One night Jared and Stephanie started to become even more intimate together.   She was very
playful about the whole thing, and Jared gulped as he realized how willing she was.  "What if you get
pregnant," he asked.  She just smiled and said, "I'm on the pill.  And if that doesn't work, it's no big
deal.  I know how to get an abortion."</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">"An abortion?" Jared asked. "Wait a minute."  It hit him like a freight train that they were now
talking, even if only hypothetically, about a baby that could be his own child.  Suddenly he felt confused
and uncomfortable.  He was seeing a connection that had somehow escaped  him before, a link
between sexuality and children--what the scriptures call "posterity."  He also felt hurt that what she was
willing to do with him, she had probably done with other guys.</font> </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">"Listen," said Jared.  "When you talk about sex, you're really talking about getting married and
having kids.  And when you talk about families, you're talking about religion.  I don't like this, 
Stephanie.  I know where the spirits of babies come from, and I know what sex is supposed to mean. 
Sorry, but I'm out of here."</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Stephanie was shocked.  She didn't understand what he was talking about, and she asked him
not to push religion on her.  Jared didn't think he'd said anything about the church.  He was just talking
about what seemed right to him.  He took her home abruptly, then drove off feeling angry, but not quite
sure why.  Close to tears, he kept on driving, trying to settle down and clear his head.  He kept thinking
about what he'd almost done.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">After driving around the city for an hour in an aimless sort of way, Jared decided to call his
cousin, a returned missionary who was married and attending his same college.  He'd seen his cousin
once on the campus, but he had passed up the cousin's invitation to come for Sunday dinner.  "Look, I
know it's late," said Jared, "but I need to talk to you." As they sat together in the cousin's little
apartment, Jared told him about Stephanie and that he'd just broken things off with her.  Then Jared
gave his cousin a very serious look.  "You know what," he said, "I need to date active LDS girls who
really care about the whole family thing the same way I do.  Why couldn't I see that before?"</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Now let me compare what happened to Jared with what happened to a lot of people on</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">September 11.  The twin towers of the World Trade Center collapsed while a shocked nation watched
on television in disbelief.  Among so much else that has happened since that awful day, many Americans
have begun to re-think their personal values, weighing what matters most against what matters least.
That's what Jared was doing.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">A few days after the terrorist attack, I listened to a man named Martin Kaplan in a broadcast
interview.  He said the attack had changed America's entire culture. "We have been living for several
generations now in what has loosely been called a post-modern society in which nothing really matters,
nothing has meaning, reality or truth.  Everything is socially constructed.  Suddenly, a plane slams into
the World Trade Center and people say, [Wait a minute.] There is reality, there is truth.  There are
things worth fighting and dying for.  There are things that have consequences, things that transcend
individuals, parties, even nations or belief systems, that we subscribe to or should subscribe to, a
common set of definitions that should not be undermined by the cultural relativism that's held us in its
thrall for generations."<a href="#N_7_"><sup> (7)</sup></a></font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I heard the same thought expressed in another interview with some high school students.   A
reporter was asking them if they would now be willing to fight and even die in a war.  These kids said
the war on terrorism was forcing them to define what they value.  The clear-cut evil of this enemy has
defined right and wrong so clearly that almost all of them were ready to go to war if need be.  What a
contrast with the era of the Vietnam war, when some anti-war protesters held up a sign that said, 
"Nothing is worth dying for"</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">If we're more clear now about what is worth dying for, are we more clear about what is worth
living for?  I recently heard another reporter who said he had asked a number of Americans what was
the main change in their lives since September 11.  Their most common answer was, "I have been
saying 'I love you' a lot more to the people I care about the most."  We give our lives for what we
believe, what we value, and whom we love.  We give our lives to those causes a day, even an hour, at
a time.  What Jared realized that night was that he was about to give a big chunk of his life, his
procreative power of posterity, to a senseless, even an evil cause.  And he awoke to claim the
testimony he didn't know he had.  His heart was telling him things his mind did not yet clearly know.</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">He was like Amulek, who said, "I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I
would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on
rebelling against God." (Alma 10:6) What then got Amulek's attention was a vision from an angel. 
What got Jared's attention was a vision from evil.  What has our nation's attention is another evil vision.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">So now the question for all of us is the one Elder Henry B. Eyring asked at October 
Conference about all the people who've started praying since the terrorist attack.  "I hope the change
lasts," said Elder Eyring.  His concern, and mine, is that, as Mormon wrote,  "Except the Lord doth
chasten his people with many afflictions [and] visit them with . . . terror . . . they will not remember
him." (Hel. 12:3)</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Can WE remember Him?  Can we remember our vision of being with the man or woman we
love, with our children, and with the Lord, forever?  I wish you would close your eyes and see yourself
in white, kneeling at a holy altar in a temple.  Then imagine the two you, like Adam and Eve, holding
each other and walking back together into God's presence. Can you see it?  Can you remember this
picture with enough power to live for it and work for it, this week and next month?   This vision is worth
really living for, a day at a time, an hour at a time.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Too many Latter-day Saints today somehow believe they can have one hand touching the walls
of the temple and the other hand touching the unclean things of the world.  We cannot do that.  As
Alma said, "touch not their unclean things." (Alma 5: ) I plead with you, put both hands on the temple. 
Put your arms around the temple, and hang on.  That is how you must hold on to your family dream.  If
you don't, the tigers will come at night and tear your dreams apart.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">As I think of Jared's story, I want to share one specific example about not touching the unclean
things of the world.  In dating and hanging out, even when you feel there is a growing foundation of true
love in a relationship, show your profound respect for that love - and for the doctrines about eternal
love and family life -- by restraining your passions.  Please don't be deceived by the false idea that
anything short of the sex act itself is okay.  That is a lie, not only because one step overpoweringly leads
to another, but because even touching another person's body with sexual intent is part of the intimacy
that is kept holy by the sanctuary of chastity.  Please also beware of unnatural sexual behaviour that is
just as immoral, if not worse,  than traditional fornication or adultery.  If for any reason you think you
may have dashed your own hopes by a past mistake,  I testify of Christ's atonement and the power of
complete and honest repentance.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Now let us return once more to our vision of family life.   I want to share with you an
experience that comes back to me, being here in Rexburg in the fall.  On a bright fall afternoon some
years ago, I went fishing not far from here with my seven-year old son, Mark.  As I splashed up the
shallow stream in my waders, I carried him on my back.  He held his feet above the water and hugged
me tight around the neck, laughing in my ear when I would stumble on the rocks; he said he hoped
we'd fall into the water.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">We stopped at one spot to fish.   I soon looked up at the clear blue sky, almost tasting the
crisp fall air.  I saw early snow on a distant mountain peak.  I drank in the color of autumn leaves in the
backlighting of the sun.  I saw Mark downstream, skipping rocks on the water.  The sun caught the
pure whiteness of his blond hair, and his agile form stood out against the shadows of the wooded
background.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I felt a sudden rush of feeling that I suppose only a father or mother can know.  My heart
reached out to touch him as the thought struck me, that he is my son, my own little boy, my posterity,
and I am his dad.  He is filled with a child's love.  I am responsible to God for my conduct as his father. 
He and I are sealed together, if we are faithful.  He is the fruit of the deep love I feel for his mother. 
The constancy of her daily life is teaching him the way of truth and light.  That's why he is so secure, so
mentally healthy.  Thank God for such a child.  What miracles are worked by the laws of nature and of
nature's God.  In that moment, I felt in harmony with everything I saw.  It was a witness to me of the
Lord's love.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I promise you that you can experience the fulfilment of your desire for eternal love, if you really
want it, so long as you don't want anything else more. I pray that you will do the work required to fulfill
your family dream.  The longing of the heart for this fulness is a source of great power, even
on-especially on-those cloudy days, or years, when your dreams seem impossible.  Your longing to
belong forever to a loving family comes from God, and He has promised its fulfillment, if you are faithful:
"For he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness." (Psalms 107:9)  You can
live happily ever after, for the Lord God has spoken it.  I know His promise is sure.</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I close with the last verse of the opening hymn we sang today.  I didn't know we were going to
sing this, but it fits our topic perfectly, especially this close to Thanksgiving.  In act two of our three-act
play, these words can mean so much.  We sang,  "For the joy of human love,/ Brother, sister, parent,
child./ Friends on earth and friends above,/ For all gentle thoughts and mild,/ Lord of all, to thee we
raise/ This our hymn of grateful praise."</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">I testify to you that feeling human love, even when love hurts you and your heart feels broken,
those feelings are God-given.  They are the motivation that will take us back to Him.  I testify of their
source.  I testify that He will help us fulfill our longing.  It is a central vision of the gospel.  May God
bless us, every day, with the strength to remember the vision and do the work, I pray in the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.</font></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000080">It is great to be with you here today at BYU<font face="Times New Roman"></font>Idaho. My first exposure to this campus was
when I was a missionary over twenty-eight years
ago. In those days they had part of the Missionary Training Center
here--then called the LTM, or Language Training
Mission. Some of the missionaries lived in the
dorms, and we had our classes in classrooms on
campus. After returning from the mission field I
attended school here and graduated. Three of our
children have graduated from Ricks College, and
they loved their time here.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Over time, this campus has experienced some
changes. The campus is more beautiful now and is
home to some wonderful new buildings. Since I
graduated from Ricks, the student body has grown;
even the name has changed! Despite the changes,
some things remain constant--the low
temperatures, for example, and the strong Rexburg
wind. The personal attention of the faculty and staff
and what we used to call "the spirit of Ricks"
haven't changed, and it's good that those things
remain.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It has been exciting to be a spectator and watch
the transformation to BYU<font face="Times New Roman"></font>Idaho. These changes
are prompted by a prophetic view of this school
and the needs of the kingdom. The Lord has a way
to have the right people in place when He needs to
make changes. President David&nbsp;A. Bednar has been
raised up and is the right person in place "for such a
time as this" (Esther 4:14). It isn't just President
Bednar, though. The administrators and the faculty
are the right people that can make these bold
changes work and create this "new" university.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In one of his books, President Spencer W.
Kimball quoted F.&nbsp;M. Bareham. At the beginning of
the twentieth century Bareham wrote:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"A century ago [in 1809] men were following
with bated breath the march of Napoleon and
waiting with feverish impatience for news of the
wars. And all the while in their homes babies were
being born. But who could think about babies?
Everybody was thinking about battles.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"In one year between Trafalgar and Waterloo
there stole into the world a host of heroes:
Gladstone was born in Liverpool; Tennyson at the
Somersby Rectory; and Oliver Wendell Holmes in
Massachusetts. Abraham Lincoln was born in
Kentucky, and music was enriched by the advent of
Felix Mendelssohn in Hamburg.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"But nobody thought of babies, everybody was
thinking of battles. Yet which of the battles of 1809
mattered more than the babies of 1809? We fancy
God can manage His world only with great
battalions, when all the time he is doing it with
beautiful babies.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"When a wrong wants righting, or a truth wants
preaching, or a continent wants discovering, God
sends a baby into the world to do it" (in <em>Faith
Precedes the Miracle</em> [1972], 323).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Not many years ago you were the babies of the
world. You are now on your way to making a
difference on the earth and in the kingdom. Some of
you will be well known. Many won't be well
known, but will be just as important in the work of
the Lord. As you face your future, I'd like to
discuss the impact that making and keeping
covenants has on you and the path you will follow
through life.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We've heard the definition of a covenant as a
two-way promise or an agreement between two
parties. That is true, but the Bible Dictionary
clarifies an important point about covenants
between God and man. It says that ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
case it is important to notice that the two parties to
the agreement do not stand in the relation of
independent and equal contractors. God in his good
pleasure fixes the terms, which man accepts"
("covenant," 651). We don't set the terms or
"bargain" with the Lord when it comes to His
covenants with us.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You might have heard of missionaries who
promise the Lord to do increasingly difficult things if
the Lord will positively provide people for them to
baptize. This is sometimes even referred to as
"covenanting." This seems to be an improper
approach to missionary work. In the first place we
are in no position to tell the Lord what blessings we
should get from a covenant we have set the terms
for, and in the second place we can't control other
peoples' agency. We can't "force" people to be
baptized on our time line, and the Lord won't. They
have their agency. It can be proper to make
covenants of what we will do, but it doesn't seem
proper to try to extract a certain blessing from the
Lord by setting the terms of a covenant.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Anti-Nephi-Lehis made a solemn covenant
not to take up their weapons of war because of
their concern for the welfare of their own souls.
Their covenant came as a result of their conversion,
and yet, the covenant they made was focused on
what they would do, not on what they expected
from the Lord. It would have been improper for
them to covenant to lay down their weapons and
even bury them if, for example, they expected the
Lord would promise to always protect them from
their enemies.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Bible Dictionary further notes, "The gospel
is so arranged that principles and ordinances are
received by covenant placing the recipient under
strong obligation and responsibility to honor the
commitment." This is a pattern. There are covenants
connected with principles and ordinances of the
gospel.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The Lord honors His covenants. In Psalm 89:34
we read, "My covenant will I not break, nor alter
the thing that is gone out of my lips."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Think of how many billions of people have lived
on the earth. The Lord has never broken His
covenants with one of them. He has never withheld
the promised blessings from one person who has
been true to his covenants. What are the chances
that you or I would be the first He withheld
promises from? It will never happen. If we keep our
covenants then the promises are sure. He is the
same "yesterday, today, and forever" (Mormon
9:9).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">He tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants 82:10,
"I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but
when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Let's look at the covenants associated with the
sacrament for an example. We covenant to be
willing to take upon us the name of the Son, to
always remember Him, and to keep His
commandments. We are promised that we may
always have His Spirit to be with us (see D&amp;C
20:77). If the Lord always keeps His covenants,
then those who do take upon them the name of the
Son, always remember Him, and keep His
commandments will have the blessings of the Spirit
in their lives. We can count on it. Each of us has this
blessing as we keep this covenant.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There are promises associated with each
covenant the Lord has given to us. We can listen
carefully for the promises. If you have been through
the temple you can participate again in the different
ordinances performed there and listen carefully to
the promises given as part of the covenants.
Thinking of those marvelous blessings is almost
overwhelming. They can be ours. They will be ours
if we keep our covenants. There is no gamble here;
it is sure.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Listening or pondering on the promises
associated with the covenants of the Lord can help
us realize that the blessings far outweigh any efforts
we make to keep our covenants. This is only
possible because of the Savior's Atonement.
Pondering those promises helps us understand more
fully the tender mercies of God. We can never earn
the blessings that are so richly poured out on us
when we are obedient. When we experience the
great blessings that are ours, it is natural to "stand all
amazed" (see <em>Hymns,</em> no. 193).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Keeping covenants helps us be more like the
Savior. His life was the perfect example of covenant
keeping as he carried out His Father's will. The
Savior said in John 6:38, "For I came down from
heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him
that sent me." When we are making and keeping
sacred covenants, we are doing the will of the
Father and the Son.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">If we make the covenants in our lives that lead to
eternal life, and then keep them, we will receive
eternal life. We will also have the joy that
accompanies righteous living.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How can the adversary stop us from obtaining
these blessings? He can't. But he will use every
effort to get us to forfeit these blessings. First, he
will try to convince us not to make the essential
covenants with the Lord. Many missionaries have
experienced the heartache of investigators who have
testimonies but decide not to be baptized, depriving
themselves of promised blessings.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Next, Satan tempts us to enter into our
covenants unworthily. Elder Russell M. Nelson
taught: "To enter the temple is a tremendous
blessing. But first we must be worthy. We should
not be rushed. We cannot cut corners of
preparation and risk the breaking of covenants we
were not prepared to make. That would be worse
than not making them at all" (in Conference Report,
Mar.-Apr. 2001, 40; or <em>Ensign,</em> May 2001, 32).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">And finally, if we have made covenants worthily,
the adversary tries to convince us to break those
covenants. We can be comforted that he can't force
us to break our covenants. He can't force us to
enter covenants unworthily, and he can't prevent us
from making eternal covenants when we have been
taught and know they are right. Because of our
agency, we make the decisions in these areas. The
Lord will help us keep our covenants.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When we break covenants, we choose to do so.
The adversary will try any method he can to get us
to break our covenants. He will tempt us. He will
promote subtle and not so subtle false doctrines,
which, if we believe, will lead us to commit sins or,
in other words, break our covenants. The Prophet
Joseph Smith taught: "The devil has no power over
us only as we permit him. The moment we revolt at
anything which comes from God, the devil takes
power" (<em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</em>
sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 181).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The teachings of the different anti-Christs in the
Book of Mormon produced interesting results
among their followers. Those who believed the
teachings ended up in sin.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Korihor taught in Alma 30:23-24: "Because I do
not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and
because I do not teach this people to bind
themselves down under the foolish ordinances and
performances which are laid down by ancient
priests, to usurp power and authority over them, to
keep them in ignorance, that they may not lift up
their heads, but be brought down according to thy
words.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold,
I say they are in bondage. Ye say that those ancient
prophecies are true. Behold, I say that ye do not
know that they are true." Can you sense that these
teachings, if believed, might turn a person to think
that covenants are a burden? What a dangerous and
false thought!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Russell M. Nelson taught further: "With
each ordinance is a covenant--a promise. A
covenant made with God is not restrictive, but
protective. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When we choose to deny ourselves
of all ungodliness, we lose nothing of value and gain
the glory of eternal life. Covenants do not hold us
down; they elevate us beyond the limits of our own
power and perspective" (in Conference Report,
Mar.-Apr. 2001, 42; or <em>Ensign,</em> May 2001, 34).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Korihor also taught other false doctrines, like
"whatsoever a man did was no crime" and "when a
man was dead, that was the end thereof" (Alma
30:17-18).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Not only did the people who believed him sin,
but they lifted up "their heads in their wickedness,
yea, leading away many women, and also men, to
commit whoredoms" (Alma 30:18). Does that
sound like anything in our world today? Can you
think of serious sins that people are actually flaunting
in the media today and even in parades?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Our safety lies in making sure we don't do
anything to break our covenants. If something is
taught and accepted by the world but is contrary to
the promises we have made, we must resist it with
all our might. If we can keep our mind and heart
focused on what we have covenanted and then be
true to that, we will find great joy. Our standard of
behavior becomes the promises we've made and
the commandments the Lord has given, not the
world's degenerating definition of propriety.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One of Satan's subtle messages is that the
promised blessings won't actually come. We can't
control the timing of the blessings, but they will
come. Part of the test is to see if we will remain
strong when the promises haven't yet been fulfilled.
The promises extend into the eternities; even though
we don't see the total fulfillment in this life, the
faithful will experience all the blessings promised.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Think of Abraham and Sarah. They had been
given the promise of a vast posterity. They were
very old, and the promise seemed impossible to
fulfill. They remained true, and the Lord blessed
them miraculously with a son. What would have
happened if their faith had wavered and they had
broken their covenants? What a tragedy that would
have been.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I wonder how many members of the Church
have wavered and broken their covenants because
the promised blessings weren't on the time line they
had envisioned. How many tragedies could have
been averted if they had just held on!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Neal M. Maxwell said: "Since faith in the
timing of the Lord may be tried, let us learn to say
not only, 'Thy will be done,' but patiently also, 'Thy
timing be done.'" (in Conference Report,
Mar.-Apr. 2001, 76; or <em>Ensign,</em> May 2001, 59).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I think of faithful women in the Church who have
not had the chance to be married to a worthy man
in the temple. They are so careful not to break their
covenants because they know that if they are faithful
to their covenants they will receive all the promised
blessings. Nothing will be withheld from them. But if
they give up and break their covenants and cease
living the gospel, then those great promises are no
longer theirs.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">We shouldn't make decisions about being faithful
based on the immediate consequences.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego kept their
covenants and refused to worship the idol
Nebuchadnezzar had set up. He confronted them
and told them what would happen if they refused to
worship the image: "If ye worship not, ye shall be
cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery
furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you
out of my hands?" (Daniel 3:15).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Listen to their answer: "Shadrach, Meshach,
and&nbsp;Abed-nego, answered and said to the king,
O&nbsp;Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer
thee&nbsp;in this matter.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to
deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will
deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that
we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden
image which thou hast set up" (vv. 16-18).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">"But if not." Think of what those three words
represent. These three young men were not basing
their obedience on the hope of deliverance. Even if
they were not to be delivered, their behavior would
be the same. They would not break their covenants!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Each of us will be tested thoroughly to determine
if we will keep the covenants we have made in the
face of pressure, persecution, and temptation. We
can be like these three young men and keep our
covenants no matter what we face. Our situations
may not be as dramatic but will also test us to the
limit. The great news is that the Lord will help us
keep those covenants if we are committed and
willing.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The covenants we make are between us and the
Lord. No one else can keep us from being exalted.
I repeat: No one else can keep us from being
exalted. It&nbsp;may seem comfortable to put the
responsibility on&nbsp;someone else, but ultimately only
we will be accountable for our choices. Even those
with spouses who break their covenants will receive
all the promised blessings if they themselves remain
true and faithful.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">You may have met someone who isn't involved
in the Church anymore because they have been
offended or feel they haven't been treated right
there. Remember, our covenants are between us
and the Lord. When we covenanted to "serve him
and keep his commandments" (Mosiah 18:10) at
our baptism, I&nbsp;don't know of any provisos such as,
"As long as everyone is nice to me" or "If the
bishop doesn't tell me to do something I don't want
to do" or "If it doesn't put me out too much." We
made a serious covenant to keep His
commandments. We will be judged on how well we
keep our covenants.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Keeping our covenants is independent of our
situation. It doesn't matter if we are in a group,
together with another person on a date, or all alone.
We will keep our covenants and then reap the
blessings. Pressure from others or the enticings of
the world won't be the determining factor in our
choices because we know what we have promised
to do and what we have promised not to do, and
we will live up to those promises.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What we want most can only be obtained by
making and keeping covenants with the Lord. We
all want peace in our lives. We all want to be
happy. We want love and acceptance. We want a
family. We want the riches of eternity. We want to
be with loved ones forever.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One of the great ironies in life is that so many
people try to obtain happiness and peace and these
other blessings in ways that can't work. The only
way to truly obtain these desires is by making and
keeping the Lord's covenants. In fact, if we are
willing to do that, there are no limits to our
promises. We are even promised all that the Father
hath (see D&amp;C 84:38).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Elder Boyd K. Packer taught: "Ordinances and
covenants become our credentials for admission
into His presence. To worthily receive them is the
quest of a lifetime; to keep them thereafter is the
challenge of mortality" (in Conference Report, Apr.
1987, 27; or <em>Ensign,</em> May 1987, 24).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">All the promises associated with our covenants
are made possible by the Atonement of Jesus
Christ. I testify that He lives. The kingdom has been
restored in latter-days with the priesthood on the
earth to officiate in the ordinances and covenants
that are necessary for our exaltation. I know that we
are led by prophets, seers, and revelators.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In Doctrine and Covenants 35:24 there is a
powerful promise: "Keep all the commandments
and covenants by which ye are bound; and I will
cause the heavens to shake for your good, and
Satan shall tremble and Zion shall rejoice upon the
hills and flourish." May this be our lot as we
diligently keep our covenants. In the name of Jesus
Christ, Amen.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000080">In the rural towns of Galilee, Jesus often frequented the synagogues and took occasion to teach. 
In Jerusalem, the Savior frequented the temple where he also taught.  Each time those who listened
were astonished by his knowledge of the scriptures, the clarity of his doctrine and the authority by
which he spoke.  Upon entering Capernaum during the early part of his ministry, Mark records that he
went</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>straightway on the sabbath day ... into the synagogue, and taught, And they were
astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the
scribes</em> [Mark 1:21-22].</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Jesus' first opportunity to teach in the temple at Jerusalem occurred when he was still a boy.  At
twelve years of age, he accompanied his parents to the feast of the passover to celebrate Israel's
deliverance from Egypt.  As the feast ended and it came time to depart for Nazareth, Joseph and Mary
had the impression that he was with relatives in another part of the company.  After a day's journey
they learned that he was not with the expected kinsfolk and returned to Jerusalem to find him.  After
three days of searching, they located him in the temple "sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing
them, and asking them questions.  And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and
answers" [Luke 2:41-47].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Eighteen years later, again at passover, Jesus entered the temple at Jerusalem.  On this
occasion, he cleansed the temple of those selling merchandise and taught the gathered Jews about his
atonement and resurrection citing scripture.  Even those closest to him did not fully appreciate the
words of his sermon until three years later when he rose from the dead.  But again, they were amazed
with his knowledge of the scriptures.  On another occasion, Jesus returned to Jerusalem to celebrate
the feast of tabernacles.  Again, he taught at the temple.  John records that the "Jews marvelled, saying,
How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?" [John 7:14-15].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What did the Jews mean when they asked "How knoweth this man letters."  Obviously, they
saw Jesus as a learned man, one familiar with the scriptures and the doctrine.  In fact, his understanding
and grasp of the scriptures exceeded theirs.  On the other hand, they paradoxically saw him as one
"having never learned."  What was the meaning of this phrase?  Jesus, unlike Paul, had not sat at the
feet of one of their learned doctors!  He had not been part of their schooling system.  Therefore, how
could he have acquired such profound knowledge?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">How did Jesus acquire his understanding of spiritual matters?  First, like every child, he was
taught by his mother and Joseph.  They knew of his divine Sonship.  They had been taught by an angel
of his mission and destiny.  They knew of his forthcoming atonement and that his mercy would last from
generation to generation [Luke 1:50].  With little doubt they were highly effective teachers during the
early years of the boy's life.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Second, knowing the identity of his Father and his purpose on earth, it is reasonable to assume
that Jesus learned much through prayer.  Undoubtedly, he was taught to pray as a young boy by his
mother with prayer continuing into adulthood.  The importance of prayer in his life is illustrated by the
fact that his ministry began with forty days of fasting and prayer in the wilderness and concluded with a
night of agony and prayer in the Garden.  Often he sought the privacy of the mountains in order to pray. 
After one of those private moments a disciple, having watched him, plead "Lord, teach us to pray, as
John also taught his disciples" [Luke 11:1].  Jesus clearly pointed out to his listeners that the doctrine he
taught was not his but came from God.  Only through prayer could he have known this truth. Having
received the Holy Ghost following baptism and a declaration of approval from his Father, one may
assume that he had a close working relationship with the heavens throughout his life.  Luke states that
during his growing years as he increased in wisdom and stature, he also increased "in favor with God
and man" [Luke 2:52].   Communication with the Father was a very important source of learning.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Third, Jesus was a student of the scriptures.  I believe that scriptural study was a major
contributor to his knowledge of spiritual truths.  If he was to understand our learning process in
mortality so that he could succor us, then it was essential that he learn in like manner.  The evidence is
strong that he was diligent in searching the scriptures prior to his ministry.  Jesus' first sermon in
Nazareth is a demonstration of his familiarity with the Old Testament - the scriptures of his day.  He
deliberately chose Isaiah 61:1-2 to announce his divine Sonship to those in the synagogue.  The
passage reads:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the
captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>To preach the acceptable year of the Lord</em> [Luke 11:18-19].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Following the reading, Jesus told the congregation that he was the fulfilment of the passage. 
The Jewish leaders understood the meaning of the verses.  They knew that Isaiah's words were a direct
reference to the Messiah.  For them, Jesus' claim to be the fulfillment was blasphemous.  "Is not this
Joseph's son?" they declared.  Jesus then likens himself to Elijah and Elisha noting the problems they
had with the Israelites of their day and that "No prophet is accepted in his own country" [Luke 4:24-27].  The Jews were enraged by his use of the scriptures and attempted to kill him.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Another illustration of his familiarity with the scriptures is the story of Jesus and the two men on
the road to Emmaus following his crucifixion and resurrection.  It is Sunday, the day of the Lord's
resurrection, and the two men are discussing the recent happenings.  The Savior approaches and joins
them.  Luke indicates that the eyes of the two men "were holden that they should not know him" [Luke
24:16].  Jesus asks them why they are so sad.  They in turn question him suggesting that he must be a
stranger in those parts if he is not aware of the events concerning Jesus of Nazareth.  The two men then
repeat for the Master the particulars of the trial, the crucifixion and their disappointment in that they
thought Jesus was the one who would redeem Israel.  They conclude by telling the story reported that
morning by women of their company who visited the tomb, found it empty and learned from angels that
Jesus was alive.  They are astonished by the women's report and do not know what to make of it. 
After listening to their recitation, Jesus says:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken;</font>
</em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them 
		<strong>in all the
scriptures</strong> the things concerning himself</em>  [Luke 24:25-27].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Jesus used the scriptures to teach the two disciples the necessity of his death and resurrection
as part of the Plan of Salvation.  The prophetic words of the Lord's servants for centuries had pointed
to these three days.  All of the prophets from Moses to Malachi had looked forward to the atoning
events and had written about them.  Later that evening after the scales had fallen from their eyes and
Jesus had vanished from their sight, the two men turned to each other and said:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened
to us the scriptures</em>? [Luke 24:32].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Jesus knew the scriptures.  His familiarity with them was earned through study and prayer.  One
suspects that he became a student as a boy and his study continued throughout his life.  Since he was
also the Jehovah of the Old Testament, one suspects that his understanding of and familiarity with the
scriptures came quickly.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Jesus was not only a student himself, but commanded that we also join with him in that pursuit. 
He said:</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">From the beginning of time, God has directed the affairs of his children in mortality through
prophets.  Their inspiration has been written down and approved by the people as scripture. 
According to the apostle Paul, these written words have been passed from one generation to another
for the purpose of declaring "doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" or, as
Christ said, for a testimony of his divinity and understanding of his mission that we might "have eternal
life" [2 Tim. 3:16].  By illustration and commentary, I wish to help you appreciate the spiritual power
and understanding that awaits if you are willing to pay the price of becoming a diligent student of the
scriptures.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In a direct statement to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord declared why reading and studying
the scriptures may be a revelatory experience.  In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 18, verses 34-36, the Lord speaking of the Book of Mormon said:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are
of me . . . For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my
Spirit . . . and by my power you can read them one to another . . . Wherefore, you can
testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In this passage the Lord states that when reading the scriptures one may hear his voice, feel his
Spirit and know his words.  Many people read the scriptures.  I suspect, however,  most are in the
early stages of being taught by the Spirit, of feeling "pure intelligence flowing into [them], of receiving
sudden strokes of ideas," of feeling the warmth of the Spirit.<a href="#N_1_"><sup> (1)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is interesting to note that when Lehi arrived in the desert with his family he realized that he had
forgotten something very important.  It was the scriptures.  Although the brass plates served a number
of purposes, the most important was the spiritual guidance provided the prophet and his family during
an arduous, difficult journey.  By reading the scriptures to each other, Lehi and some of his family drew
closer to the Lord, enjoyed the blessings of his Spirit and received the strength to move forward.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The prophet Nephi records that the Lord provides instruction for everyone whether in the east,
west, north or south.  He speaks to people through servants whose words are applicable for them and
by whose words they will be judged [2 Ne. 29:11].  For example, the prophet Mormon said the Book
of Mormon was written for our day.  Mormon was shown the conditions that would prevail and then
provided a warning.  He said:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not.  But behold, Jesus Christ hath
shown you unto me, and I know your doing . . . I know that ye do walk in the pride of
your hearts . . . unto the wearing of very fine apparel . . . For behold, ye do love money,
and your substance . . . yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick
and the afflicted to pass by you . . .</em> [Mormon 8:34-39].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">These words are an apt description of today's developed countries.  Economics is more
important than matters of the Spirit.  Clearly, there are exceptions.  The events of September 11
softened the hearts of many in this country as people reflected on the deaths of loved ones and the
meaning of life.  It is critical that our focus be on the needs of others and not on the wealth we can
accumulate.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">When reading the scriptures it is important to ponder the meaning of them.  The Gospel of John
in the New Testament provides a rich opportunity for Church members to deepen their appreciation of
the Savior and his atonement.  All of us are familiar with the four gospels in the New Testament -
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  The first three are known as the synoptic gospels because they "see
alike," i.e., they are similar in approach and use much of the same material.  These three gospels bear
witness of Christ through a narrative beginning with his birth and ending with his death and resurrection. 
The Gospel of John, on the other hand, is different.  Ninety-two percent of the material in John is not
found in the other three gospels.  Rather than tell the story of Jesus' life, key events are employed by
John to teach important principles.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">The <em>LDS Bible Dictionary</em> indicates that the four books were written for different audiences. 
The Dictionary states:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>It appears from the internal evidence of each record that Matthew was written to
persuade the Jews that Jesus is the promised Messiah.  To do so, he cites several Old
Testament prophecies and speaks repeatedly of Jesus as the Son of David, thus
emphasizing his royal lineage.  Mark appeals to a gentile audience and is fast moving,
emphasizing the doings more than the sayings of the Lord . . . Luke offers his readers a
polished literary account of the ministry of Jesus, presenting Jesus as the universal Savior
of both Jews and gentiles . . . Luke is favorable toward the gentiles. . . John's account
does not contain much of the fundamental information that the other records contain,
and it is evident that he was writing to members of the Church who already had basic
information about the Lord.  His primary purpose was to emphasize the divine nature of
Jesus as the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh</em> [<em>LDS Bible Dictionary</em>, Gospels, 682-683].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">As noted, John appears to have been written for members of the Church who have an
understanding of basic gospel principles and who Jesus is.  With this context in mind, what did John
want the members of the Church to know?  We do not have time today to discuss entire book of John,
but a review of the first five chapters may be helpful in answering the questions.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The first chapter of John presents testimonies of who Jesus is.  Through the Doctrine and
Covenants we know that the testimonies are those of John the Beloved and John the Baptist [D&amp;C
93:1-18].  A knowledge of the Godhead and the Plan of Salvation is required to fully appreciate the
messages given in this chapter.  The first verse indicates that Jesus was in the beginning, that he was
with God, that he was God.  To fully appreciate the meaning of the first verse, a knowledge of the
premortal world and the relationship between the Father and the Son is necessary.  Jesus was the
firstborn in the spirit and lived in the world of spirits with the Father before coming to earth.  Because of
his righteousness and the light within him, he was a God.  As such, Jesus was the Creator of all things as
noted in the third verse.  We know through modern revelation that Jesus did create all things under the
direction of the Father [Moses 1:32-33].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Verses 4-9 state that Jesus is the source of life and light for every man and woman.  We know
that the Light of Christ is given to every person that comes into the world to help them know right from
wrong.  We also know through modern revelation that the Light of Christ is the ultimate source of light
and energy for the sun, for the stars and for this earth [D&amp;C 88:7-10].  Consequently, Jesus is the
source of life.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Perhaps the most important verse in Chapter One is verse fourteen.  It reads:</font></p>
<p><em><font color="#000080">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as
of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Only Latter-day Saints fully understand and appreciate the meaning of the phrase "The Only
Begotten of the Father in the flesh."  Jesus as a person in the premortal world was the spirit offspring of
Heavenly Parents.  For his earthly parents, however, Jesus had an immortal Father and a mortal
mother.  Through his mother he received mortal seeds which allowed him to die.  Through his Father,
he inherited immortal seeds which allowed him to live forever if he so chose.  On one occasion he told
the Jews, "For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself" [John
5:26].  On another occasion, Jesus said,</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.  I have power to lay it down, and I
have power to take it again.  This commandment have I received of my Father</em> [John
10:17-18].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Although the Romans nailed Jesus to the cross, his death was of his own volition.  As Paul said,
he had the power of an "endless life" [Heb. 7:16].  He did not have to die.  He was the Son of an
Immortal Being.  His death was a voluntary sacrifice.  From his mother he had the power to lay down
his life.  From his Father, he could take it up again.  That is why the atonement is infinite and eternal
[Alma 34:10, 14].   It was performed by an infinite and eternal being.  Although there is much we do
not understand about the atonement, a knowledge of Christ's relationship to the Father clarifies the
source of his power to accomplish it.  Also, a knowledge of the mortality within him helps us appreciate
the tremendous pain and suffering he endured to atone for our sins [D&amp;C 19:16-19].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The first chapter concludes with other testimonies that Jesus is the Messiah.  John the Baptist
identifies Jesus as the Lamb of God.  In other words, he is the sacrificial lamb for all mankind.  Andrew
and Philip also bear witness.  This wonderful chapter is an introduction to Jesus as the Redeemer of the
world.  It teaches us of his divinity and the source of his power.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Jesus and his disciples enter Cana on the third day of the week to attend a marriage celebration
to which they have been invited.  During the feast, the host and hostess run out of wine.  The Savior's
mother then approaches Jesus and asks for help.  His response:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Woman, what wilt thou have me to do for thee? that will I do; for mine hour is not yet
come</em> [JST John 2:4].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Jesus agreed to the request made by his mother but noted that his actions would relate to his
hour even though that hour had not yet come.  What was Jesus' hour.  In numerous references it is the
time in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross.  His hour is the time during which he performed the
atonement.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">After asking the servants to fill six waterpots to the brim, waterpots used for cleansing and
purifying, he tells them to draw out and take to the governor who asks why the "good wine" has been
kept until now.  John then states, "This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him" [John 2:11].  We know that the glory of
the Father and the Son is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man [Moses 1:39].  What
did the conversion of water to wine signify?  What did the wine represent?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There are a number of parallels that might be drawn.  What do you suppose is the color of the
"good wine."   Might it be likened to the "best blood" shed in the Garden and on the cross to "cleanse
and purify" mankind.  The power to convert water to wine might parallel the power of Christ's
atonement to change all mankind from mortal to immortal beings, to change corruptible bodies into
incorruptible ones, to create an inseparable connection between body and spirit in the resurrection.  In
short, the miracle at Cana not only illustrated Christ's power to change the earthly element of water to
wine but also his power to change men and women from a telestial to a celestial state.  Remember, the
miracle was connected with his hour and did show forth his glory.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The third chapter of John is concerned with the introductory ordinances of the Church.  After
introducing Christ in Chapter One and confirming the purpose of his mission in Chapter Two, John
turns to the basic ordinances required for one to participate in the blessings of the atonement.  The story
is that of Nicodemus, the Jewish leader, coming to Christ by night asking what he must do in order to
enter into the Kingdom of God.  He is told that he must be born of  water and of the Spirit.  He must be
baptized by immersion for the remission of sins and receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">Chapter Four then describes what a member following baptism should do to stay on the path to
eternal life.  This chapter tells the story of Christ meeting the Samaritan woman at the well and telling
her of living water which quenches one's thirst forever.  Christ is the Fountain of Living Waters and
those who drink from his well will never thirst.  The water is a symbol for his words, the gospel of Jesus
Christ.  The water is also linked to the sacrament in our day which reminds us that we must internalize
his words by taking his name upon us and by keeping his commandments.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The fifth chapter of John is the story of Jesus healing the sick at Bethesda.  For me, the story
has great meaning.  The scriptures read:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew
tongue Bethesda, having five porches.  In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of
blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.  For an angel went down at a
certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the
troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.  And a
certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.  When Jesus saw
him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt
thou be made whole?  The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the
water is troubled, to put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another steppeth down
before me.  Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.  And immediately the
man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked</em> . . . [John 5:2-9].</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">To what ordinance, covenant or promise does this miracle refer?  Will there come a time when
Jesus will tell us to rise and walk and be made whole?  One of the great blessings that awaits all
mankind is the glorious resurrection, the opportunity to be redeemed from the bands of death.  There
will come a time in which each person will be given the power through Christ's atonement to restore the
sleeping dust "unto its perfect frame, bone to his bone, and the sinews and the flesh upon them . . ."
[D&amp;C 138:16-17].  When that day comes, we will not be able to say, "I have no man to help me." 
Just as the lame man at Bethesda took up his bed and walked and was made whole, so we in the
resurrection will be blessed with the greatest healing of all as we receive a perfected, immortalized,
incorruptible body for which we will be eternally grateful.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Brothers and sisters, do you feel the beauty and power of the scriptures?  Can you sense the
blessings that await if you drink deeply of Christ's living water?  Will you set aside a few minutes each
day to read from the scriptures and then ponder the meaning of the verses read?  When the day comes
for us to stand before the keeper of the gate, the Holy One of Israel, it is my prayer that he will not
perceive in us a slowness of heart to believe that which the prophets have spoken.  Rather, may he see
us as men and women of spiritual letters having learned day by day over a lifetime.  May each of us
prepare to meet him is my prayer in his Holy Name, even Jesus Christ.  Amen.</font>
