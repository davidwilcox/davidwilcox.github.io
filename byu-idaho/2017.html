<p></p>
<p>Welcome to the first devotional of the semester! I appreciate the beautiful music and prayer, which have brought the Spirit here today. Thank you.<br /><br /> As members of the Church, we know how important the role of motherhood is. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has taught, "There is nothing more important in this world than participating so directly in the work and glory of God."<a href="/devotionals/sister-christine-c-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> I have come to witness this working within our family in my mothering role. I am so grateful to nurture and try to develop each of these remarkable children in my service as a mother. <br /><br />There have been times in my life where others around me didn't feel quite the same type of enthusiasm. I remember working at a job in California when I announced our first pregnancy. This was something we had been hoping for and praying about for a long time. I was surprised when one of my colleagues responded by asking me, "How can you have a baby when you haven't even owned a dog?" Later, we began graduate school when our oldest son was eight months old. Our new little family found ourselves at an opening social with the doctoral students in my husband's program. I could tell right away that we were unlike anyone else in this group. Not only were we among the few who were married; we were the only ones who had a child. As I began visiting with people, someone asked me the question "What do you do?" I stood confidently in front of this accomplished Harvard Business School student and responded, "I am a mom!" I'm not sure what I expected his reply to be, but what came next was a long awkward pause. "A mom ... and nothing else?" he seemed to say. Somehow, I got through both of those very uncomfortable conversations and learned how to better navigate responses to being a mother. <br /><br />As the world continues to shift, how can we learn to build the role of mothers? <br /><br />In the Book of Mormon, we read how the Gadianton robbers were growing in strength against the Nephites. By the request of his people, Gidgiddoni went to the Lord asking how they might defend themselves from these robbers. The response from the Lord was instructive. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will prepare ourselves in the <em>center</em> of our lands, ... we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come against us.<a href="/devotionals/sister-christine-c-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> &nbsp; </p>
<p>Just like the Nephites prepared in the very <em>center</em> of their lands for the enemy, so must we prepare at the very center of our homes and families by building and strengthening the role of mothers. <br /><br />Today I would like to share counsel both to our young women and to our young men in how they might further defend the role of motherhood. <br /><br />Sisters, while you immerse yourself in education at BYU-Idaho, you have the great opportunity to develop attributes essential for mothers, but you also have the opportunity to be thoughtful about your <em>choice</em> to be a mother.&nbsp;<br />Sister Julie B. Beck has said, </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The responsibility mothers have today has never required more vigilance. More than at any time in the history of the world, we need mothers who know.... When mothers know who they are and who God is and have made covenants with Him, they will have great power and influence....<a href="/devotionals/sister-christine-c-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> &nbsp; </p>
<p>Sisters, when you know why the Lord wants you to be a mother, you will have more courage to stand up against a society that would belittle that choice. You will also have the depth of character to develop the talents and skills needed to be an effective mother. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />To the brethren, you can learn <em>now</em> to support, defend, and encourage the women in your lives. Start with your own mothers and sisters by respecting and showing gratitude to them for all they do. Secondly, be considerate to the women you come in contact with each day in your wards, home evening groups, and classes. Elder Quentin L. Cook described how we might be more supportive of mothers: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">First, no woman should ever feel the need to apologize or feel that her contribution is less significant because she is devoting her primary efforts to raising and nurturing children. Nothing could be more significant in our Father in Heaven's plan. Second, we should all be careful not to be judgmental or assume that sisters are less valiant if the decision is made to work outside the home. We rarely understand or fully appreciate people's circumstances. Husbands and wives should prayerfully counsel together, understanding they are accountable to God for their decisions.<a href="/devotionals/sister-christine-c-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a></p>
<p>For all of us, if we don't hold up the role of motherhood, others in the world will tear it down! We are so blessed at BYU-Idaho to be in a place where motherhood is valued and to be surrounded by people who seek to defend the family. This is a perfect time to prepare at your very center by building, lifting, and strengthening each other. It is my prayer that we can work together to defend and build mothers. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> I would like to spend some time talking with you today about the importance of education and its role in our spiritual progression. In this audience, there is a student who isn't sure whether he can make it in college. There is also a young woman who isn't really focused on her education, because she doesn't see its connection to her role as a mother. There is a returned missionary who wishes he could rediscover his spiritual purpose. There is a student who is satisfied to just get by. There is another student who sees no point in helping others. Finally, there is a student listening today who is one of our brighter students but who views herself as superior to others. <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>All</em> of these students are struggling to understand who they are and what is expected of them. And, as we shall soon see, they are also struggling with real conversion.</p>
<p><strong>Conversion Brings a Drive to Learn</strong> <br />President Henry B. Eyring has taught that "conversion brings a drive to learn."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> In fact, this is a pattern that can be observed from the start of the Restoration. "Joseph Smith had essentially no formal schooling, yet the effect of the gospel of Jesus Christ on him was to make him want to learn more so that he could be more useful to God."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> As early as 1833, Church leaders established the School of the Prophets in Kirtland, Ohio.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> When the Saints later settled Nauvoo, their original charter included the creation of a university. After the martyrdom of the Prophet and the trek west, the Saints followed that pattern again as they established the University of Deseret (later to become the University of Utah). Those early Saints had barely harvested their first crops, and they had already begun a temple, a newspaper, and a university. The pattern of education continued as over 30 frontier academies were established. One of those academies was built right here in Rexburg and would later become Ricks College and eventually BYU-Idaho. We share a legacy of sacrifice and investment in education, an investment that came not from a previous culture of learning but rather from a newfound conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Consider the painting by Ken Baxter entitled "Embarkation of the Saints at Liverpool," which depicts the early British Saints boarding for Zion. <br /><br /> <img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional_Graphics/2017%20Winter/Gilberts/Images/embarkation-of-the-saints-" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Ship-Image_300x225.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />I love this scene because it is a reminder that our Church started with immigrants who were poor and largely uneducated. Those early pioneers used the gospel to lift themselves and become a mighty people. <br /><br />Why would those early members do so much to invest in education? Part of the explanation is that we are <em>commanded</em> to learn. President Uchtdorf has taught, "For members of the Church, education is not merely a good idea--it's a commandment."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> We have a responsibility to acquire education because it will help provide for the financial security of our families. In today's society, education is the gateway to opportunity and financial security. Education also enables us to serve in the Church. President Eyring stated the following: "Why worry about education? Because learning is how we prepare to serve both now and in eternity."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> <br /><br />While the financial, professional, and leadership benefits for education are compelling, there are still deeper reasons for the commandment that Latter-day Saints pursue an education. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read, "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> President Eyring described education as the "[mighty] struggle for perfection."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> And Brigham Young taught, "The first great principle that ought to occupy the attention of mankind ... and which is the main spring of all action ... is the principle of improvement."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> Like Elder Neal A. Maxwell's description, education is the "scaffolding for the soul," a structure that starts us on a journey of spiritual growth and personal improvement.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> <strong></strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Overcoming Obstacles in Our Educational Journey</strong> <br />So if education is the transcendent process of personal and spiritual progression, how do we reconcile that with the very real daily challenges of life? This takes me back to the students I described at the start of my talk. If we truly understand the role of education, we should become attuned to anything that inhibits our learning. In fact, like so many of the blessings that come from heaven, the adversary seeks to either prevent or corrupt all of our sacred opportunities. For the rest of our conversation today, I'd like to take you on a pilgrim's journey, if you will, in our efforts toward acquiring an education. On this journey, I will present five profiles of students in their educational struggle for perfection. Imagine these as deepening layers of challenge, almost like zooming in on Botticelli's depiction of stories across layers in Dante's <em>Inferno</em>. But unlike Botticelli or Dante, at each step of our struggle for perfection, I hope to also share ways to overcome the immediate educational challenge, which in every case will involve and require a deepening of conversion. <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>The Doubter</em> <br />Let's start with our first student. I will call him the doubter<em>. </em>This individual perhaps understands the value of education and even nods his head as I read quotes from the prophets on its importance. But when it comes to him <em>personally</em>, he doesn't believe those messages actually apply to him. I've met these students across the Church as they weighed whether to apply to Pathway. I've met these students here on this campus, who weren't sure whether they had what it takes to succeed in college. Where does such doubt come from? Maybe they struggled in high school. Maybe others in their lives made them feel like they weren't capable of higher academic work. But while the challenges the doubter<em> </em>faces are real, he must learn to resist those feelings of self-doubt. I think of Moses being tempted by Satan to see himself only as a product of his earthly circumstances and to ignore his divine heritage and potential.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> Moses learned to realize he was a son of God, endowed with divine potential. President Hinckley declared to the youth of the Church, "You have the potential to become anything to which you set your mind."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> <br /><br />Part of overcoming doubt and fear is learning who you are and understanding the potential that is in you. Overcoming doubt often requires you to find people who will believe in you. I would like to share a personal experience of this in my own life. <br /><br />In my grade school, they had an accelerated learning program called the Gifted Program. I applied to the program four separate times and never made it. It must have been the picture I submitted in my application. Adding to my frustration was the fact that each of my siblings made it the first time they tried. I soon concluded that I must not be "gifted." In fact, I viewed myself as just an average student who had little hope for accelerated learning. However, as I graduated middle school, one teacher recognized my efforts and presented me with an award for character and scholarship. This recognition unlocked a belief in my potential that I didn't know I had and changed my entire high-school experience. <br /><br />Students, look for people in your lives who will believe in you, and lean on them for support. To our faculty, look for that potential in your students. For you students, find that friend, family member, teacher, or mentor--someone who can cheer you on, keep you accountable, and hold you to high expectations. <br /><br />Another way to overcome doubt is to not be paralyzed by the risk of failure. We have a family motto in the Gilbert home to "Do Your Best." My father used to tell us as children, "I don't care what grades you receive as long as each of you 'does your best.'" Over time, that caused us to work hard, fear failure less, and in fact eventually improve our ability to succeed as students. So, to the doubters out there, believe in yourself, know of your potential, find others who believe in you, do your best, and get back up when you struggle. As President Monson has&nbsp;said, <br /><br />I urge you to not take counsel of your fears. I hope you will not say, "I'm not smart enough...." Our Heavenly Father will make you equal to your tasks. If one should stumble, if one should take a course and get less than the "A" grade desired, I hope such a one will not let it become discouraging to him. I hope that he will rise and try again.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> &nbsp; <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>The Student with Misplaced Zeal</em> <br />I'd next like to describe a student who misses the connection between otherwise righteous endeavors and his or her formal education. I call this individual the<em> </em>student with misplaced zeal. One manifestation of this comes in the future mother who doesn't see her schooling as important because, in her words, "I'm just here to get married." To be clear, there is no more noble a goal for young men or young women at this university than to prepare for marriage and parenthood. I hope you could feel Sister Gilbert's commitment to motherhood today. But I would also encourage you young women to consider your academic stewardship prayerfully. President Monson has said, "Statistics reveal that at some time, because of the illness or death of a husband or because of economic necessity, you may find yourself in the role of financial provider.... I urge you to pursue your education--if you are not already doing so or have not done so--that you might be prepared to provide if circumstances necessitate such."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> Of course, there are spiritual reasons for you to take your education seriously. Certainly, your education will help you be a better mother. You will be more effective at teaching and communicating with your children as they grow. You will also be better prepared to serve in the Church. As President Nelson recently taught, <br /><br />We need women who are organized and women who can organize. We need women with executive ability who can plan and direct and administer; women who can teach, women who can speak out.... We need women with the gift of discernment who can view the trends in the world and detect those that, however popular, are shallow or dangerous."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, sisters aren't the only ones who suffer from misplaced zeal. I meet so many young men, returned missionaries, who complain that they miss being involved in purposeful work. To those young men, I can only extend an admonition to repent and get to work understanding how to develop your educational stewardship. I can hear a few of you saying, "Yeah, right, President. Tell me how accounting or mechanical engineering or political science is as meaningful as missionary work." My response is that <em>none</em> of those are as meaningful <em>unless</em> you know that is what you are supposed to study and you consecrate those efforts to the Lord. C.S. Lewis addressed this in his lecture entitled "Learning in War-Time<em>.</em>" It was 1939 and all of England knew that war was imminent. The question then became, if we are on the eve of war, shouldn't everyone pour every effort into preparing for the pending battle against Hitler? Isn't it less patriotic or even selfish to send our youth off to school rather than focus everything on preparing for war? Lewis then turns the argument to the battles for men's souls, asking "how it is right, or even psychologically possible, for creatures who are every moment advancing either to heaven or to hell, to spend any fraction of the little time allowed them in this world on such comparative trivialities as literature or art, mathematics or biology."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> And at BYU-Idaho, if we are involved in a battle between good and evil, shouldn't our entire curriculum be focused on producing seminary teachers? For Lewis, as it should be for all of us, the answer comes down to the intent of our learning: "The work of a Beethoven and the work of a [house cleaner], become spiritual on precisely the same condition, that of being offered to God, of being done humbly 'as to the Lord.'"<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> In other words, choose your major and your profession in a way that is consecrated to God. <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>The Student Who Is Going It Alone</em> <br />The next category of student I will discuss seems to be heading down that path with very little velocity, commitment, or direction. I call this the student who is going it alone<em>. </em>He views his academic experience with some indifference and is happy simply to get by. <br /><br />Nearly four years ago, I received a call from a graduating BYU-Idaho student named Jonathan, whom I had mentored for over a decade since our time together in Boston. Jonathan had come from a broken home in inner-city Boston, out of a community where very few students attended college, let alone finished. In some ways, Jonathan was just happy to be graduating, but he could sense I was less taken with the milestone. My reply was loving but firm: "Jonathan, I am so pleased with what is happening. You have come so far, and I am so proud of you. But you also need to understand that this is actually just one step in a future path that the Lord has been preparing all along. Indeed, if you truly understood what the Lord expects, you would realize He needs you to keep working, even though you have made it this far." <br /><br />In the three years since that graduation, Jonathan has moved on to meaningful professional work. Then, last year, he walked through another graduation from a master's program on the East Coast. He now manages millions of transactions at one of the nation's leading e-commerce companies. More importantly, Jonathan has grown in the work of his family and in his service to the Church. &nbsp; <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>The Selfish Student<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></em> <br />The next student I will describe is one who only wants to engage if there is something in it for himself. I call this the selfish student<em>. </em>He wants to get his education and move on to the next stage of life. He views others he has to interact with as an annoyance or even a distraction. President Eyring taught us the failure of such thinking when he explained how learning is never for us alone. In his words, "The university is, like the temple, a place where success can come only if we help others succeed.... The climbs to the places God would have us go are never for us alone. If we forget that, we will not have His full power to lift us."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> In fact, the fifth principle of the BYU-Idaho Learning Model states that "learners and teachers at BYU-Idaho love, teach, and serve one another." So the next time you are asked to pair up and help someone in your class or you are assigned to work on a team with others, get to work helping to lift and build these students, and realize you are learning something much more important than even the topic you are studying. In fact, you are fulfilling President Eyring's prophecy when he said, "They will be natural leaders who know how to teach and how to learn.... Those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become--and this is a prophecy that I am prepared to make and make solemnly--those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> Education and our mighty struggle for perfection are not for our own glory but must be fundamentally connected to helping others. <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>The Prideful Student</em> <br />The last student we will consider today is perhaps the one I worry about most. From the outside, this might be surprising because this student is succeeding in class, has many natural abilities, and perhaps has even been recognized for his strong academic work. But somewhere in the process of learning, this student has used his very success to make him feel superior and maybe even make others feel less so. In 3 Nephi we see the Book of Mormon pride cycle and how education led to pride and class distinction. <br /><br />And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-2017#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Learning can be used in an attempt to elevate ourselves above others. Learning can also lead to entitlement, a presumption that we deserve something more because of our education. Elder David A. Bednar has repeatedly given this warning to members of this community: <br /><br />If the day ever were to come that intellectual arrogance, a lack of appreciation, and a spirit of demanding entitlement take root on this campus--among the students, the faculty, the employees, the administration, or within the community ... then in that day the Spirit of Ricks will be well on the way to being extinguished.... Conversely, as long as intellectual modesty, humility, gratitude, obedience, and frugality continue to characterize those who learn and serve at Brigham Young University-Idaho, then this university will shine forth ever brighter as a beacon of righteousness and of inspired educational innovation. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Conclusion</strong> <br />Today we have gone on a journey together exploring the mighty struggle for perfection that comes through education. We have explored the challenges of five different students: the doubter, the student with misplaced zeal, the student going it alone, the selfish student, and the prideful student<em>.</em> Likely, all of us could see some of ourselves in each one of those students. I also hope we could see opportunities to rise above those challenges through increased conversion and commitment to the Lord. It is my prayer that you will see this opportunity and use your time at BYU-Idaho to lay that foundation of a lifetime of improvement, growth, and development. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>He Lives<br /></strong>Welcome to devotional. Thank you for inviting the Spirit with both word and song. A special welcome to those of you here for your first semester and those of you joining us online or by some other media miracle. I have felt overwhelmed at this opportunity. After reviewing many inspiring stories and a plethora of memorable quotes, the message that I have been impressed to share is simply this: He lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few months ago, I found myself in a hospital room alone--waiting for test results--waiting for my husband to arrive. The minutes felt like hours. I started to question and painfully ponder, "Did I tell my children everything I wanted them to know? Did I tell them that I know Christ lives? Did I tell them that their Heavenly Father loves them and will never leave them? Did I tell them that love and living temple covenants keep families together? I wasn't sure that I had. I started to text them frantically--just in case this was really it. Well ... thankfully, that was not my last day on earth. I was given a second chance, and with that second chance I want to tell <em>you</em> the same things that I wanted my children to know. I know my Savior lives. I know this--not because of some magnificent vision in a sacred grove but because I found Him in the scriptures. I am here to testify that the scriptures truly lead us on the path home; they empower faithful men and women to stand as witnesses of Christ in all circumstances. And, finally, the scriptures saved my life and renewed my hope and joy in the truth that my Redeemer lives.</p>
<p>First of all, the scriptures lead to the path home, and through them we can come to know our Redeemer. &nbsp; <br /><br />The adversary knows the power of God's words, and works hard to keep us from studying them. He tirelessly places deceptions and distractions in our path. He has worked hard to set up many roadblocks to keep the scriptures from becoming part of our daily lives. We need to recognize these deceptions, be grateful for the prophets who sacrificed so much, and choose every day to fish from living waters. <strong></strong> <br /><br />My mom was raised on a dry farm in Squirrel, Idaho. (This was before she went to Chile to marry my dad.) Her dad would buy grease in five-gallon buckets. Once emptied, the buckets served multiple purposes. Grandpa often carried his tools around in these buckets. Sometimes they would hold chopped barley to feed the pigs and chickens. One summer Mom found a bucket placed outside the house under a faucet--not sure why. Having caught the summer-day boredoms, she decided to use the bucket as a fishing pond. She found a stick and a piece of string to which she tied one of Grandma's sewing pins. The pin made a perfect fish hook. That first day she fished for a couple of hours. She didn't catch anything. As the summer passed, she and her siblings spent several more hours fishing out of the would-be fish pond. She said to me, "By the end of summer, none of us had ever caught a fish." Now that she looks back on her fishing days with a bit more life experience, she realizes with a smile that there were no fish in that bucket. <br /><br />To catch fish, you must fish where fish live. To find Christ, we must fish in the rivers of living waters. There is no need to fish in empty buckets. We can find Christ in our scriptures, in words of latter-day prophets, and in personal revelation through the gifts of the Spirit. As we study God's words, we learn who we are, where we came from, and what Heavenly Father's plan is for us. We will also come to know the Savior and will feel our Heavenly Father's love. The adversary does not want us in the scriptures. He doesn't want us in church on Sundays nor to listen to general conference. He would distract us with thoughts that we are too busy or our testimonies are just fine. Missing church this once won't affect me. Yet this causal observance will make us weak and unprepared for the storms ahead. <br /><br />In 1 Nephi 8:30 we read, "He saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree." The iron rod guides us through the mists of darkness in this life. We cannot just casually hold on to the rod. We must cling to it, continually holding fast. This takes active effort on our part, not just a casual reading of the scriptures nor casual sacrament attendance. We must go to the scriptures and to our meetings with purpose, specific questions, humility, and faith that our Heavenly Father's words are found there. As we study, the Holy Ghost will open our hearts to hear the individualized messages our Heavenly Father has for each of us. <br /><br />The word was so important that the Lord commanded Lehi to send his sons back for the brass plates. Nephi said, "And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children" (1 Nephi 5:21). <br /><br />In Mosiah we read about the people in Zarahemla, who originated from the son of Zedekiah, who escaped Jerusalem around the same time Lehi did. His people had forgotten God and did not remember the great things He had done for them. Their language had been corrupted. A blatant difference between the Nephites and the Mulekites was that the latter lacked the written words of God. They did not have a cornerstone from which to build their foundation on the Lord (see Omni 1:17). <br /><br />By contrast, you and I have been blessed to live at a time when we have easy access to written revelation. Many have made sacred sacrifices so you and I could go to a shelf or to our phone and have the word of God within seconds. Back in the early 1500s, William Tyndale hid from authorities as he worked to translate the Bible into English. His hope was to put the scriptures into the hands of the commoner. He is known to have said, "If&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/God" title="God">God</a>&nbsp;spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough to know more of the Scripture, than [(the Pope)] dost." Having the words so accessible would thwart Satan's plans. Knowing this, Satan has continuously fought to keep the word from us. (D. Todd Christopherson, "The Blessing of Scripture," <em>Ensign</em>, May 2010) <br /><br />Tyndale fled from country to country and endured much tribulation as he continued his work. He was finally imprisoned and after a year and a half brought forth, strangled to death, and burned. Joseph Smith sealed his testimony of the truth with his own life. Countless other prophets have given all they had--many their own lives--to provide us with God's words. It is tempting to let distractions keep up from serious daily scripture study and prayer. Let's not let the prophets' sacrifices be in vain. Let's not let that which now is so easily found lie on our shelves unopened. There is power, faith, hope, encouragement, testimony, and guidance within the scriptures. They truly testify that the Savior lives. <br /><br />Secondly, the scriptures empower faithful men and women to stand as witnesses of Christ and proclaim with their lives, "He lives."<strong> </strong> <br /><br />Corrie Ten Boom, the daughter of a Dutch watchmaker, and her family courageously hid and rescued many Jews during the Holocaust. For this, she was eventually imprisoned along with her family. In her book <em>The Hiding Place</em>, Corrie ten Boom describes some of the sufferings she endured and witnessed at the German concentration camps (Corrie Ten Boom, <em>The Hiding Place</em>, 1971). At one point, Corrie shares the miraculous story of how she and her sister Betsie smuggled into camp a few pages of the Bible. They sacrificed their very lives to have the words of God accompany them into this dark world. <strong></strong> <br /><br />Corrie describes Betsie thanking God for the fleas which overran their sleeping barracks. Appalled at Betsie's gratitude, Corrie questions her sister. Betsie explains that the German guards choose to bypass their infested quarters while on patrol because of these heaven-sent bugs. Thus, each evening Betsie is safe to read aloud from the Bible. Prisoners crowd around. Translators whisper the words throughout the body-packed building, sharing the messages in various languages. These verses bring hope, light, and some solace during a time of darkness, evil, and tragic disregard for human life. Betsie continued to read from these pages until illness stole her from this world. Before she returned home, she clung to Heavenly Father's words to remind her of our Savior and a better world. <br /><br />With permission, I'd like to tell you about another person who held on tightly to the word and found guidance and solace in times of trial. When I married Brandon Moon, I was so excited to become his eternal companion that I didn't really care to ask him about his future career goals. He was good to me and loved me. He decided that he wanted to attend vocational school and pursue an associates in drafting. After being married 10 years, I found an old journal of his. In it he had written, "I want to be a mechanical engineer." Hmm. That was odd. Was it true? Did he really have different dreams before we married? <br /><br />I asked Brandon about this. He said he could never make it through the math. I understood this somewhat. When Brandon was 14, he was in a BMX biking accident which robbed him of sight in one eye and put him in Primary Children's Hospital during the beginning of his freshman year. When he finally returned to high school, he was quite behind in mathematics and never did catch up. So there it was. Mathematics was keeping him from accomplishing his goal. <br /><br />Sometime after our conversation, Brandon was impressed to go back to school. He was unsure of how he was going to accomplish this. He would need to cut back his hours at work. We decided I should not work full time--we still had young children. We would need to live on less. He had a very demanding church calling. In addition, his math background was insufficient for an engineering degree. School did not seem like a good idea. We needed a miracle. We needed the faith described in Moroni 7:33: "And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me."</p>
<p>So, with faith, very little money, and the promise that the Lord would support us, Brandon started back to school. He started in the very first math class--the one that doesn't count for any college credit--the one you take if you don't remember anything from your high-school education. Then he took the next one. Finally, after four years of preparation, sacrifice, and a little help from his wife, he applied to the engineering program at BYU-Idaho. He eventually graduated with the very first cohort in this brand new degree at this brand new four-year university. <br /><br />Along this journey back to school, I watched Brandon put the Lord first. He continued to study his scriptures and pray. He invited light into his life every day, and the Lord supported him. He did learn mathematics. He did become a mechanical engineer. He also learned that the Lord loved him. He had to start at the very beginning, but now he understands principles that he had skipped through before. <br /><br />At one point in his life, President Henry B. Eyring and his family experienced a similar circumstance. In a talk recorded in the October 2002 <em>Ensign</em>, President Eyring describes the beginning of his graduate-school days. He was in a program he felt ill-prepared for; he was struggling to meet the demands of his school work, a very busy church calling, and a young family. He knew it was a test of his faith as he tried to put the Lord first and trust that the Lord would help him with the rest. <br /><br />President Eyring says to college students, "You've carried your scriptures all day but still have not found a moment to open them. There is someone in your family who would be blessed by your thoughtful attention, but you haven't gotten to them yet. You go to a job tomorrow that barely pays enough to keep food on your table and pay your bills. Rather than finding ways to capture leisure time for learning, you are trying to decide what to leave undone. There is another way to look at your problem of crowded time. You can see it as an opportunity to test your faith." He continues, "The Lord loves you and watches over you. That is a true promise. When we put God's purposes first, He will give us miracles. If we pray to know what He would have us do next, He will multiply the effects of what we do in such a way that time seems to be expanded." <br /><br />I invite you to put God first and study faithfully while you are here. Ask him for guidance every day to lead you to what He needs you to do. As you seek Him first, the important things in your life will fall into place, and the rest will fall away. <br /><br />In Ether 6:5, 8 we read, </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass that the Lord God caused that there should be a&nbsp;furious wind&nbsp;blow upon the face of the waters,&nbsp;towards&nbsp;the promised land; and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea before the wind. &nbsp; </p>
<p>And it came to pass that the wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land while they were upon the waters; and thus they were&nbsp;driven&nbsp;forth before the wind.&nbsp;<br /><br />If the Lord had just sent a calm, gentle breeze, the Jaredites would not have made it to the promised land. It was the ferocious tempests that pushed the Jaredites to the place the Lord needed them to be. As with the Jaredites, the Lord will send each of us storms to help direct our barges to our own heavenly prepared promised lands--to places better than the ones we are at now. Remember, we don't travel alone. As we rely on the Lord to guide us through, He will help us find the light as long as we cling to Him through the darkness. <br /><br />When a student of mine, whom I will call Dillon, walked into my math class a few years ago, he lit up the room with his smile. He spread this joy and peace to all who worked with him that semester. He made my day. I don't know about other professors, but whenever I run into a former student, I rarely remember the grade they earned, but I always remember how I felt around them. Around Dillon, I felt like a daughter of God. <br /><br />When Dillon introduced himself that first day, he spoke of his fianc&eacute;e and their plans after BYU-Idaho. He was full of hope and promise. Now, I did notice that he had a peculiar physical characteristic for one so young. He was bald. I soon found out he had been battling cancer since his mission. That semester, the good news came that he was in remission. I was so happy for him and his future bride. He reminded me of the faith described in Hebrews 11: "Now&nbsp;faith&nbsp;is the&nbsp;substance&nbsp;of things&nbsp;hoped&nbsp;for, the&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1). Dillon's faith in his Savior was strong. <br /><br />In Hebrews it goes on to share many of the miracles of the Bible which came about by faith. By faith, Noah built an ark. By faith, Enoch did not see death. By faith, Isaac offered up his son. By faith, Sarah bore a child later in life. By faith, Dillon found hope and peace in his journey. <br /><br />The next semester, I received one of those campus e-mails that none of us likes to read. The e-mail let us know that Dillon had passed away. He had lost his battle here on earth. I didn't understand. He was so good, so faithful. Why didn't the Lord grant him healing? How could one so young and so good be called home so early? <br /><br />Sometime after Dillon's death, I returned to Hebrews 11. Further on it says that even the faithful are called home and sometimes tortured, mocked, scourged, and imprisoned. And yet in verse 40 of the Joseph Smith Translation for this verse, it states, "God&nbsp;having&nbsp;provided&nbsp;some better things for them through their sufferings, for without sufferings they could not be made perfect." Dillon had not lost his battle. He had won. He had come to know his Savior and lived a life which shared this testimony with all he knew. <br /><br />I have been inspired by the faith and diligence I observed in these examples and many others. I could easily see how the Lord had something better in store for each one. I understood with my mind how important the Savior was for Betsie Ten Boom; my husband, Brandon; and Dillon in their respective trials. Yet it wasn't until recently, when I had my own trial of faith, that I discovered how desperately I needed the Savior and His Atonement. I needed a lesson for my heart. <br /><br />Finally,<strong> </strong>the scriptures saved my life and renewed my own hope and joy in the truth that my Redeemer lives<strong>.</strong> <br /><br />In the fall of 2015, on the first day of the semester, I woke up with a searing pain through my chest to my back. After teaching my classes, the pain intensified. A battery of tests determined I had experienced a spontaneous pneumothorax, or a partial lung collapse. <br /><br />After some consultation, my doctor and the pulmonary specialist decided not to operate to inflate my lung. They were hopeful--as was I--that it would heal with rest and deep breathing. Wow. Rest. That turned out to be a challenge. <br /><br />My lung eventually began to improve, but I was not prepared for the emotional turmoil that followed. I had a sudden onset of fear. In addition to the collapsed lung, there were other events in my family which I began to focus on, and this misguided focus threw me into a pit of discouragement and deep despair. My faith was tested, and my hope was fading. <br /><br />I felt broken. It was more than just being anxious or downhearted. I lost my appetite. I no longer wanted to participate in daily activities. The depression finally became so debilitating I had to take medical leave from work. Sleep escaped me and magnified the intensity of the darkness. I began to worry for my life as I lost almost 30 pounds in one month. <br /><br />In addition to seeking medical help, I started searching the scriptures and general conference talks for answers. I had to know if I was going to make it through this. <br /><br />Where was my Heavenly Father? I felt alone and hopeless. I thought I had faith. Did I? As I kept searching and pleading for guidance, I found Elder Richard G. Scott's talk "Make the Exercise of Faith Your First Priority" (General Conference, October 2014). <br /><br />Elder Scott and his sweet Jeanene had lost two young children early in their marriage. Later in life, Sister Scott's untimely death left him to serve alone. If anyone knew about faith, he would. In his talk he encouraged me to make the exercise of faith a priority. He described exactly what this looks like. He invited me to study the scriptures every day, go to the Lord in heartfelt prayer, attend the temple, and hold family home evening. These were four things I could do. They were not out of reach. In fact, they were so simple I had been looking past them. <br /><br />In Matthew 14:26-31 the Lord teaches us what happens when we lose focus on Him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good&nbsp;cheer; it is I; be not afraid. <br /><br />And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. <br /><br />And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. <br /><br />But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was&nbsp;afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. <br /><br />And immediately Jesus stretched forth&nbsp;his&nbsp;hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little&nbsp;faith, wherefore didst thou&nbsp;doubt?</p>
<p>I had become like Peter and taken my focus off the Lord. I too had started to sink. I had let daily demands of life become more important than my daily scripture study, and I had allowed the focus of my family's turmoil to take my eyes off of Christ. I needed a realignment. It was time to refocus and use this time to find my Savior.</p>
<p>In addition to general conference talks, I found comfort in the Book of Mormon. One morning while home alone and struggling to start my day, I received a phone call from a dear friend. She had been studying the scriptures and found one she was prompted to share with me. It was in 1 Nephi 21:16: "Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands: thy walls are continually before me." Wow. That was a good one. To know that He had already graven me upon the palms of His hands helped me see that I was not forgotten. He knew me. Christ had already carried this burden for me. This truth seared deep into my soul. <br /><br />Then I found Mormon 5:23: "Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God?" Yes, I was in God's hands. My very life depended on Him every day. He was in charge. I could let it go. He had this. What a great place to put our lives--in His able and loving hands. " <br /><br />I posted Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's words on our family white board: "Don't you quit. You keep walking. You keep trying. There is help and happiness ahead.... You keep your chin up. It will be all right in the end. Trust God and believe in good things to come" (Jeffrey R. Holland, "An High Priest of Good Things to Come," <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1999). <br /><br />The scriptures became my friends. I started to text my favorite ones to myself. I put them on notifications to arrive later in the day. I posted them around my home. I started memorizing them. Because I had committed a few to memory, I could call them up whenever I needed a friend to encourage me or a friend to comfort me. They became my lifelines. <br /><br />Finally, Psalms 46:10 spoke to me: "Be still and know that I am God." We need a time each day to be still and remember. My medical leave turned out to be an unplanned blessing for me to refocus and remember what is truly important. The Lord needed to get my attention. As difficult as it was, I learned to be still--like the Sea of Galilee after a storm. Now that I am back into life, with deadlines and competing demands, it takes commitment and prioritizing every day to spend time in prayer and in the scriptures. We all have 24 hours. What we do with that 24 hours shows Heavenly Father and ourselves what is truly important to us. <br /><br />Like Joseph Smith, we each need our own Sacred Groves, where we can escape the commotion and noise of this world and seek our Heavenly Father. I invite you to find place and time every day to visit your own Sacred Grove. Find a time when you will not be rushed. Husbands may need to take the children for a while. Some of you may need to find a place away from your roommates. Whatever you do, decide today when that time and place will be. Be diligent. You will find peace and hope as you exercise your faith by studying His word, listening for His guidance, and talking with your Heavenly Father. <br /><br />I testify to you that spiritual power can flow into your life as you make this daily devotional part of your routine. These words will support you in trials and help you overcome. You will be conquerors. The word will keep you safe through the storms of life. "And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction" (1 Nephi 15:24). <br /><br />I testify that Jesus Christ lives. Your Heavenly Father loves you. The Holy Ghost is here to testify of these truths and lead us home. Heavenly Father's love for you is evident in His giving of His only perfect and begotten Son. These are the truths I wanted my children to know as I sat alone in a hospital room. These are the truths your Heavenly Father wants you to know and feel today. <br /><br />I know my Savior lives. If you are not sure about your testimony of Christ, don't wait for a trial. Immerse yourselves in the scriptures today. Find Him there. If you are in the middle of a trial, don't give up. He has already engraven you in the palms of His hands. Fish in the river of holy scriptures and words of the prophets; you will find Him there. As we study God's words, we are able to see and feel the Savior in our lives and the power of the Atonement in our hearts. Jesus Christ lives. His Atonement is for you and me. He carries our burdens, lifts our hearts, and grants the forgiveness we need to make us whole. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>General Authority Seventy</p>
<p>Elder Peter F. Meurs was sustained as a General Authority Seventy of The Church of Jesus<br /><br /> Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 2, 2016. &nbsp; Elder Meurs received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Monash University in 1980. He worked as an engineer for ESSO Australia and participated in the development of oil and gas production fields. He was a founding partner of Worley Parsons Limited, an international engineering services and project management company. He recently led an iron ore expansion project for Fortescue Metals and served as an executive director on the board. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Meurs has served in numerous callings, including branch president, counselor in a bishopric, bishop, high councilor, counselor in a district presidency, counselor in a stake presidency, stake president, counselor in a mission presidency, and Area Seventy. &nbsp; <br /><br />Peter Fletcher Meurs was born in Warrnambool, Victoria, Australia on December 21, 1956. He married Maxine Evelyn Thatcher in January 1979. They are the parents of four children.</p>

<p>In July 2014, I was working with YSAs to prepare for the first YSA convention in Perth on the west coast of Australia. The challenge we faced was to persuade YSA from the east coast to come. It was the equivalent of convincing YSA in Washington DC to travel and attend a convention in Los Angeles. <br /><br />The YSA decided to produce a series of YouTube promotion clips. They invited me to introduce a couple of them. Here is one example. &nbsp; <br /><br /><a href="https://byui-media.ldscdn.org/content/r71v1/entry/data/650/128/0_0tnolxl3_0_tmfpa8x9_2.mp4">https://byui-media.ldscdn.org/content/r71v1/entry/data/650/128/0_0tnolxl3_0_tmfpa8x9_2.mp4</a><br /><br />We filmed in July--midwinter in the Southern Hemisphere, so I'm glad it only took one take. The obvious differentiator is the suit with white shirt and tie. The clip continued with marvelous YSAs talking about and demonstrating some of their plans for the convention. &nbsp; <br /><br />Like the suit in the video, I hope that you realize that you have an incredible differentiator in your life. It sets you apart from the world. It makes you stand out from the crowd and is of immeasurable value. &nbsp; <br /><br />Your greatest differentiator is the gospel of Jesus Christ. As you live and apply the principles of the gospel, to your future career and every other activity in life, you will positively stand out from the world. &nbsp; <br /><br />Every part of your church experience, when applied to the world, is extremely valuable. Personal gospel study; the challenge of church callings; the things you learn as a full-time missionary; your ability to speak, to organize, to plan, to motivate; and your understanding of the joy found in service are all precious assets. When you combine these with your secular learning, you are prepared to make a significant contribution in your chosen field or profession. &nbsp; <br /><br />Let's consider six gospel based differentiators. &nbsp; <br /><br />1. Virtue--Unceasingly &nbsp; <br /><br />In the D&amp;C we read, "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God" (D&amp;C 121:45). &nbsp; <br /><br />One dictionary definition of <em>unceasingly</em> is "with unflagging resolve." When we listen to a true virtuoso musician, our emotions are stirred. It seems effortless, they naturally harmonize with fellow musicians, they evoke strong feelings in us, we want to keep listening. &nbsp; <br /><br />Similarly, in your future careers, if you let virtue garnish your thoughts unceasingly--as you demonstrate unflagging resolve to be virtuous in every situation, you will be sought after and valued. Virtues and principles such as honesty, frugality, dependability, integrity, unselfishness, respect for modesty and chastity, consistently speaking positively about others make for the equivalent of a virtuoso leader. As you exemplify these principles, you will naturally lift the level of thinking of all around you. &nbsp; <br /><br />Consider for a moment the life of Nelson Mandela. His virtuosity while in a prison cell in the apartheid South Africa for 27 years, inspired millions around the world. &nbsp; <br /><br />Individuals and organizations that establish cultures that truly value virtue are much more likely to succeed. They are trusted by their customers and service providers and naturally deliver greater value. &nbsp; <br /><br />2. Unwearyingness &nbsp; <br /><br />The Lord said to Nephi, "And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will" (Helaman 10:5). &nbsp; <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Unwearyingness</em> is a sermon in a word. It implies continuing when we are weary. It implies doing things when others would simply give up. &nbsp; <br /><br />In the October 2012 general conference, <a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/converted-unto-the-lord?lang=eng">Elder David Bednar</a> taught, "The key characteristics associated with conversion are experiencing a mighty change in our hearts, having a disposition to do good continually, going forward in the path of duty, walking circumspectly before God, keeping the commandments, and serving with unwearied diligence." &nbsp; <br /><br />Missionaries the world over know that miracles often follow a trial of our faith. The same is true in the business world. Twenty percent of salesmen get 80 percent of the sales mainly because they are consistent. They follow up and go back when so many give up immediately following the first rejection. &nbsp; <br /><br />As one of the founders and directors of a restarted company, Worley Engineering, in Perth, in 1988, I visited each of the previous customers. They told me about the demise of the former Worley and that they did not want to do business with Worley again. They rejected me and the new beginning I was proposing. What they did not know is that I was a returned missionary. To me rejection meant needing to increase my understanding of the concerns and needs of these potential customers so that I could offer them something more compelling. &nbsp; <br /><br />I found reasons to go back. Each time I would follow up on things that I had previously learned and offer something new that I felt could be of value. In the process, I discovered that it takes about seven visits to establish a business relationship. &nbsp; <br /><br />On the first visit, many people show little interest. <br />On the second visit, they are trying to remember if they have seen you before. <br />On the third visit, the discussion can move to business possibilities. <br />On the fourth visit, they listen to proposals, and the relationship develops. <br />On the fifth visit, you start talking details, and real trust becomes evident. <br />After the sixth or seventh visit, you often start working together. &nbsp; <br /><br />The natural man gives up after the first failure or rejection. The differentiator--unwearyingness, acting, following up or going back when others would not--can add blessings to your life that you can only imagine. &nbsp; <br /><br />3. Humility &nbsp; <br /><br />"I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them" (Ether 12:27). &nbsp; <br /><br />As a missionary, I learned that some of the companions that were most different to me could teach me the most and that our skills could be complementary as we respected each other and worked together. &nbsp; <br /><br />This has been an invaluable lesson in the business world, where I found that some of the most difficult people can offer incredible value in their field of expertise. It is often worth putting up with or seeing past some idiosyncrasies and differences. In fact, if you surround yourself by people just like you, you are likely to severely limit your potential. &nbsp; <br /><br />Our church experience helps us to develop the humility to work with and contribute as part of a team. At church and in the world, some indications of humility in a leader include: &nbsp; <br /><br /></p>
<p><br />My father taught me a principle of humility as a young man. He said, "Peter, whatever job you have, if you will work hard and consistently contribute more value than you are paid for, then one day you will be paid more than you can ever earn." &nbsp; <br /><br />This and the concept of always striving to add additional value have been guiding principles for my life--they lead us to search for ways to work smarter, challenge norms, and constantly think about the best ways to achieve important overall objectives. &nbsp; <br /><br />4. Revelation through Councils &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Ballard has consistently taught us about the power and effectiveness of councils.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">God called a grand council in the premortal world to present His glorious plan for our eternal welfare. The Lord's church is organized with councils at every level, beginning with the Council of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and extending to stake, ward, quorum, auxiliary, and family councils. <br /><br />President Stephen L Richards said: "The genius of our Church government is government through councils. I have had enough experience to know the value of councils. Hardly a day passes but that I see ... God's wisdom, in creating councils ... to govern his Kingdom. ... <br /><br />"... I have no hesitancy in giving you the assurance, if you will confer in council as you are expected to do, God will give you solutions to the problems that confront you" (Strength in Counsel, General Conference, October 1993).</p>
<p>In church and family leadership, we quickly discover that revelation, solutions, and change come through councils. The Lord consistently teaches us his pattern of councils in the scriptures. He says that council decisions "are to be made in all righteousness, in holiness, and lowliness of heart, meekness and long-suffering, and in faith, and virtue, and knowledge ... patience ... and charity.... If these things abound in them they shall not be unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord" (D&amp;C 107:30-31).&nbsp;<br /><br />I found that the principles of councils apply powerfully in the business world. As a leader, I was most effective when I engaged with my associates with a question, issue, or problem. In these settings, it was important to show confidence in the council's ability to deliver a solution. I continue to be amazed at the quality of the solution and the ownership participants in councils have in delivering results together.<br /><br />This is in stark contrast to the approach of many leaders who feel that they have sole responsibility and capability to come up with solutions to the big issues. They feel that their job is to roll out their solution rather than engage their associates in developing it.<br /><br />The concept can be extended to suppliers and contractors. Part of my career involved delivering major resource development projects. The normal engineering process is to send detailed specification documents to equipment suppliers and detailed procedure documents to contractors. While this is effective in controlling outcomes, it limits the opportunity for suppliers and contractors to apply their skills and experience to the solution. &nbsp; <br /><br />I found it more helpful to seek input and suggestions for delivering the required outcomes rather than initially constraining contractors and suppliers with specification requirements and contract terms. &nbsp; <br /><br />5. &amp; 6. Prayer and Repentance &nbsp; <br /><br />Amulek taught the importance of praying while at and about work. He admonished,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks. &nbsp; <br />Cry unto him over the crops of yours fields, that ye may prosper in them. &nbsp; <br />Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase. (Alma 34:20, 24-25)</p>
<p>The Lord speaking through the Prophet Joseph Smith declared in the D&amp;C, "He who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more. By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them" (D&amp;C 58:42-43). &nbsp; <br /><br />My first job was building an oil production pipeline to connect a new offshore oil platform to an existing platform, and hence the pipeline network. The offshore pipeline was the first in the world (in 1982) to be installed using the bottom tow technique. For many reasons, this was an exciting project for a young engineer. The excitement intensified when my boss, the project manager, was moved to another international assignment, making me the responsible project engineer. &nbsp; <br /><br />The project involved making up 1-kilometer-long strings of 12-inch-diameter steel pipe at a beach site, then towing lengths of pipe into the ocean and joining sections until a 3.5-kilometer pipeline was complete. A tow vessel would pull the complete pipeline 85 kilometers along the seafloor to the offshore location. Sophisticated deflection connection procedures, using winches and hydraulic connectors, were planned for the final connections. &nbsp; <br /><br />Success depended on towing the pipeline along a prescribed path, then stopping the tow so that it would be exactly positioned and aligned for subsea connection at 280-foot water depth. &nbsp; <br /><br />This was many years before GPS satellites. We used the best available navigation systems and acoustics transponders on the pipeline to track its position. &nbsp; <br /><br />The tow had some significant challenges; however, we followed the prescribed route exactly and felt that we had stopped the tow leaving the connecting sleds at the front and back end of the pipeline exactly in the target positions. &nbsp; <br /><br />With the tow complete, a survey boat pinged acoustic transponders on the pipeline and reported positioning data by radio to a control hut on one of the platforms. We were delighted as the survey confirmed that the front end was exactly in the right position and, a little later, that the pipeline alignment was also perfect. &nbsp; <br /><br />That, however, was the end of the good news. &nbsp; <br /><br />The final check on the tail end of the pipeline reported that it was 36 meters out of position. After triple-checking, we concluded that the pipeline was 36 meters too long. &nbsp; <br /><br />Everyone immediately wanted to know how we had measured and confirmed the length before the tow. As the responsible project engineer, I could not answer the question. I had been so deeply engaged and interested (as a young engineer) in all the high-tech systems and processes that I had missed the fact that the pipeline length was equally vital to success. &nbsp; <br /><br />Investigation identified the cause of the error. Late in the project, we needed a weight change for stability during the tow and added 3-by-12-meter lengths of heavy wall pipe to the tail end. We had inadvertently added 36 meters without taking anything off. &nbsp; <br /><br />I radioed the developments project director at Esso to report the problem. He simply said, "Meurs, don't come back onshore until that pipeline is connected." &nbsp; <br /><br />Things initially went from bad to worse. We were still able to complete the first pull-in procedure connecting the tail end of the pipeline to the new platform. We then decided to use the tow vessel to lift the other end of the pipeline off the seafloor by tensioning the tow wire. The plan was to walk the suspended length of pipeline sideways to use the extra length. &nbsp; <br /><br />With the pipeline under tension and lifted off the seafloor, we commenced the sideways maneuver. Partway through the critical move, the tow vessel engines stopped. Under tension, the boat was pulled backwards, and the pipeline hit the seafloor with such great force that a rubber shear sphere in the end dislodged. Sea water rushed in, and the pipeline weight went from 80 tons to 400 tons in a few seconds. &nbsp; <br /><br />What had seemed like a most exciting and challenging project for a young engineer suddenly looked like a disaster. I had been praying night and morning, but now I poured out my soul to Heavenly Father. I explained that I had served a mission, married in the temple, we had started our family while at university and now had two beautiful daughters. After all of this, it looked to me like my engineering career was coming to an end. I pleaded for inspiration and help. &nbsp; <br /><br />My prayers were answered, and within a couple of weeks, with promptings, hard work, and input from a wonderful team, we connected the pipeline and tested it. I returned to shore to face the music. The extra 36 meters had added $3 million to a $15 million project. &nbsp; <br /><br />I had to write a project closeout report. Thankfully I understood repentance.</p>
<p>To my surprise, my report was received very positively. Over the next two years, I led a team that installed longer and more complicated bottom-tow pipelines. Cost savings were more than twice the extra cost of the first installation. &nbsp; <br /><br />I had learned many more important lessons than checking the measurement before towing a pipeline--I had learned that Heavenly Father is willing to answer all our prayers, even when we pray about our work. I also learned the power, in the world, of stepping forward and taking responsibility when we make mistakes. &nbsp; <br /><br />Prayer and principles learned through repentance--taking responsibility and offering to be part of the solutions are valuable differentiators.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Conclusion &nbsp; <br /><br />My message today to you, the great students of Brigham Young University-Idaho, is simply this: You are blessed to study and learn in your chosen fields. You are blessed to be taught by a faculty that have been carefully selected based on their talents and secular achievements and their faith and commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ. As a result, you have the opportunity to prepare to make important contributions in a world that has great need of you. We live in an age of opportunity and change. &nbsp; <br /><br />It is my hope that you will ponder on the power of the combination of your secular education and the gospel of Jesus Christ. I hope that you will understand that applying gospel principles to everything you do will bless you and all those you associate and work with. I hope that you will resolve to be completely consistent in applying gospel principles to your lives. &nbsp; <br /><br />In the D&amp;C we read this comprehensive promise:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated-- &nbsp; <br /><br />And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated. (D&amp;C 130:20-21)</p>
<p>In his October 2016 general conference talk, President Russell M. Nelson taught us about joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If we look to the world and follow its formulas for happiness, we will never know joy. The unrighteous may experience any number of emotions and sensations, but they will never experience joy! Joy is a gift for the faithful. It is the gift that comes from intentionally trying to live a righteous life, as taught by Jesus Christ. &nbsp; <br /><br />"Every day that you and I choose to live celestial laws, every day that we keep our covenants and help others to do the same, joy will be ours."</p>
<p>I share my witness that our Heavenly Father lives and loves us, that His Son Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, and that the Father's plan presented by the Savior is a plan of happiness and joy. I know that applying gospel principles to every aspect of our lives will bring us joy on the earth and eternal success. &nbsp; <br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Guest Hosting and Institutional Events Coordinator</p>
<p>Patricia Woolley Gannaway was born and raised in Ames, Iowa. &nbsp;She graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor's degree in elementary education. In a Chemistry 100 class her first semester at BYU, she quickly learned that the most important chemistry was between her and classmate Joe Gannaway; they were married two years later.&nbsp; </p>
<p>She and Joe are the parents of four college-age sons, two grandsons, and a granddaughter on the way.&nbsp; Their youngest son is currently serving in the Tennessee Knoxville Mission. &nbsp; <br /><br />Sister Gannaway has served in almost every organization in the Church, and has loved every calling she has ever had. She is now working with the Cub Scouts in her ward, and is also enjoying the opportunity to get to know and love the students in the Rexburg YSA 29<sup>th</sup> Ward, where her husband serves as bishop.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Sister Gannaway works in University Relations as the Guest Hosting and Institutional Events Coordinator. Before coming to work at the university, she enjoyed teaching private piano lessons in her home while raising a house full of active boys with varied interests, many friends, and big appetites. &nbsp;She enjoys watching baseball games (especially the Chicago Cubs), working in the yard, and reading biographies</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2012, my husband and I were on a small tropical island in the Caribbean. Pretty much every single promotional piece about this island touts a picture of a natural rock bridge that spans 100 feet and is chiseled out from the ocean waves crashing against the rocky cliff shore. We were trying to be classic tourists, so we decided we had better go see it, but since it was on the other side of the island, we had to rent a car to get to it. When we were at the rental car place, we told the agent that we were going to go see the natural bridge. Our GPSs didn't work very well on the island, so he kindly showed us where it was on a map and the best way to get there. As we made our way across the island, we noticed several signs pointing the way, so we knew we were on the right track. We also had a tourist book with us in the car, and I began to read aloud the history of this landmark we were about to see. At the exact moment we pulled into the crowded parking lot at the site, I read these words from the book: "Unfortunately, the natural bridge collapsed on September 2, 2005." We looked at each other in disbelief! <em>What</em>? It's not even here anymore? We got out of the car, and sure enough, there was no natural bridge. We were so confused! All the advertisements, the rental car agent, the road signs, and most of the tourist book led us to see this landmark. Apparently we were trusting things that weren't trustworthy. <br /><br />What makes us trust people or things or ideas? Is it because everyone else trusts them? Is it because they look sure or dependable or experienced? As I have thought about trust, I've come to realize that it's a strong indicator for the basis of the decisions we make that eventually set the course for our lives. Every relationship we form, every activity we participate in, every decision we make, large or small, is closely correlated with who or what we trust. My question for you today is this: who or what are you trusting? What have you tethered yourself to that guides you? Is it the popular and attractive ideas that bombard you from every direction? A trend or fashion or prominent thinking that has caught your eye but won't withstand the test of time because it is shallow and dangerous?<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> Are you thinking of the countless others that will one day be affected by what you have chosen to trust? &nbsp; <br /><br />I want to show you something I did that caused me to think very seriously about trust. &nbsp; <br /><br />Two Christmases ago, our son Andy gave me a gift he really wanted me to experience. He gave me one skydiving jump. So on Labor Day, he and I headed to Moab, Utah, to board a tiny yet perfectly good airplane, each harnessed to a tandem buddy, and 10,000 feet later, we each jumped out of that perfectly good airplane. I learned a lot about trust that day. <s></s> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>What Are You Tethered To?</strong> <br />Whom or what do you have your life strapped to? Whom or what are you trusting with your life? Are you trusting your doubts? Are you trusting the Internet? Are you trusting what disgruntled or critical people say? &nbsp; <br /><br />In a tumultuous world of ever-increasing attacks on what is good and right, where people can so easily "just put their ideas out there," regardless of whether they are true or not, those ideas are heard by many, and it becomes very easy to get distracted and follow what you think sounds good. I know you want to make good choices because so much of your future depends on the decisions you make now. When you get right down to it, those decisions all depend on what you are trusting. &nbsp; <br /><br />I want you to know that following anything or anyone other than Jesus Christ will lead you to dead ends, severe consequences, and unhappiness. You can trick yourself into thinking that following something or someone else is okay because you haven't yet arrived at the consequences of your choices, or maybe you've hardened your heart to the point that you aren't noticing what you're headed for. With agency, you are welcome to go down that path. But the sooner you turn around, correct your ways, and trust the Savior, the happier you'll be. Never once has someone gone down the wrong path and the Savior has said, "Don't come back."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />The prophets will <em>never</em> lead you astray. The word of God will never lead you astray. &nbsp; <br /><br />So many people, many of whom you have not yet met, are depending on you to make good choices. &nbsp; <br /><br />While it's true that, as President Thomas S. Monson says, our decisions determine our destiny,<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> I have also come to know that what we choose to trust in our decisions affects countless other people's destinies, many we cannot foresee. &nbsp; <br /><br />For instance, when my father-in-law was a college freshman at a Baptist university on a football scholarship, he dislocated both of his shoulders during practice days before the first game of the season. Knowing he would have to sit the season out because of his injuries, he chose to quit the team and turn in his scholarship. The coaches assured him they still had a spot for him and he didn't have to relinquish the scholarship, but he insisted, saying it was the right thing to do. This changed the trajectory of his life, and rather than going to college to become a Baptist minister, he chose a different path, which eventually led him to the gospel and baptism into the Church. If not for his decision to turn in his scholarship, his life would have unfolded in a completely different way, including the fact that I wouldn't have met his son at BYU, and I probably wouldn't even be living in Idaho! I am forever grateful for the trust in God displayed by my father-in-law, whom I didn't even meet until 52 years after he turned in that scholarship. I'm sure when he made this decision, he did not have the Mormon church or me in mind. &nbsp; <br /><br />Because we hardly realize when we are about to make a choice that will have true, lasting value, we need to be sure that we have developed good habits, because those are what we will naturally defer to when decisions are made. This is especially true for the small choices. <em></em> &nbsp; <br /><br />One year ago, Elder and Sister David A. Bednar came to campus to speak at the devotional, and it was my job to assist in hosting them. They had a packed schedule from sun up to sun down, and I had to be on top of keeping things moving along so the day wouldn't fall apart. Each time I told Elder Bednar that we needed to be heading to the next event, his response was always, "Let's go to church!" It was a Tuesday; we obviously weren't going to church, but that was his enthusiastic reaction every time. At the end of the day, I told him that "Let's go to church" was one of the things I was going to remember about his visit. He said, "I like to go to church." It was clear to me that cheerfully going to church is a habit for him, one that he associates with any gospel-affiliated activity (which for an Apostle is basically everything). &nbsp; <br />What habits have you developed that help you make good choices? &nbsp; <br /><br />I have seen blessings in my life as I have created good habits, such as the habit of prayer. One of the blessings of this is that I feel confident that I can trust my Heavenly Father because we have established a relationship with each other. He knows He can trust me, and I know I can trust Him to give me the help and challenges I need. &nbsp; <br /><br />Last August, the night before our family was going out of town for a week, I thought I'd mow the lawn really quickly so it wouldn't be too unruly when we got home. I hardly ever mow the lawn (I was just trying to be helpful), and in my haste (and inexperience), I hit a sprinkler head, and it broke off of its pipe. Nobody else was home, and this needed to be fixed before we left early the next morning. I tried everything I knew, but I only made it worse. When it was almost dark, our son Tanner got home, and he and I worked on it together. Several times we thought we had fixed it, but then we'd test it, and it would sprout into a geyser and fall apart. After about the fifth attempt, covered with water and mud, we said a prayer, and the sprinkler worked. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now you could say that it would have worked even if we hadn't prayed, but what I know is that good habits have led me to do things that give me otherwise overlooked opportunities to trust Heavenly Father so He can see if I will trust Him. &nbsp; <br /><br />Think about your choice to come to devotional today. Why did you choose to come? Whether it was to take a break from homework, to be uplifted, to gather with other students who share similar values as you, or to just warm up on your way home, it was a small choice that is changing you little by little and is evidence of what you trust. You can easily make weekly devotional attendance a positive pattern in your life. &nbsp; Surround yourself with people you can trust to exemplify good habits. At this sacred and set-apart place that is BYU-Idaho, you have access to unparalleled spiritual resources that can assist in developing and deepening your devotion.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> You would do well to take advantage of these while you are here, in this stronghold of the Church. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Three Categories of Trust</strong> <br />While habits are tools we use when we make choices, they aren't necessarily the basis for why we do what we do. We have to go a little deeper to see what our decisions are based on, what we trust, and what we have tethered ourselves to. I want to discuss three main categories of opposite sources of trust. Think of which of these opposing ideas you have used as the basis for your choices. What have you tethered yourself to, and, more importantly, what do you need to tether yourself to? <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Faith or Doubts</strong> <br />The first category of trust is either our faith or our doubts. &nbsp; <br /><br />We all have faith in some things and doubts about other things. Most decisions require us to move forward in faith, not really knowing beforehand the things we should do.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> Faith is just that: not knowing or being able to see, but doing because we know it's right and we have hope and trust in a power higher than our own.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> If you have doubts about certain choices, that's a big red flag to hold off until you're confident you're doing the right thing and can move forward in faith. &nbsp; <br /><br />During the Savior's life, He taught some principles that He knew several of those listening did not believe.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> These disciples left and "walked no more with him."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />"Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou are that Christ, the Son of the living God."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Speaking of this incident, Elder M. Russell Ballard said, "In that moment, when others focused on what they could not accept, the Apostles chose to focus on what they <em>did</em> believe and know, and as a result, they remained with Christ." Elder Ballard went on to say that today is no different. For some, it's difficult to understand certain Church doctrines. Others struggle with concerns over the history of the restoration of the gospel or being a member of a church that requires so much or a number of other doubts and questions. &nbsp; <br /><br />Any doubts like these are what you should be questioning before you question what you know to be the truth. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, "We should not assume ... that just because something is unexplainable by us it is unexplainable."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> This is where faith comes in. Faith is to "hope for things which are not seen, which are true."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> &nbsp; <br />It's easy to get distracted. Our decisions show where our faith is placed and what we doubt. I love the lesson about distractions learned by Susan W. Tanner, former Young Women general president, as she was putting together the book <em>Daughters in My Kingdom</em> for the Church. &nbsp; <br /><br />After spending months in a study cubicle in the BYU library researching and writing, she got really stumped and didn't know what to do next. She says she doesn't normally have dreams that mean much of anything, but one night she had a dream where she was on a hike, and the person she was following turned a corner, and she couldn't see where he went. She tried to continue on the path, but she found herself lost in an amusement park with four walls around her (study cubicle). While she could see over the walls to where she needed to be, she couldn't see a way out of the amusement park. When she woke up, she wondered if that dream was not only symbolic of the distractions and amusements of the world encroaching on her spirit but on all of our spirits as we choose what to pay attention to and what to ignore in our lives.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />This reminds me of the words in a beloved hymn that say, "Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I love." But then follows the resolute voice of surrendering one's will: "Here's my heart, oh take and seal it; seal it for thy courts above."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Don't let distractions make you doubt what is right. Make sure that what you desire will allow you to bind your heart to His.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> He can see ahead and around corners. We just need to trust Him.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />"Trust&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;with&nbsp;all&nbsp;thine&nbsp;heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sacrifice or No Sacrifice</strong> <br />The next opposing foundational category of decision making is whether you are trusting the route that requires you to sacrifice or the route that requires no sacrifice. &nbsp; <br /><br />I am being very careful here to not call the route that requires no sacrifice the "easy route." The reason I need to be so precise is that I firmly believe that living the gospel is the easiest way through life, but that doesn't mean it's easy. In fact, it does require sacrifice. &nbsp; <br /><br />I had the sweetest conversation with a woman our missionary son had the privilege to teach the sweet gospel message to last year. She was excited to have found the saving truths she had been taught, and the relief of taking this step in her life was evident in her voice. I was genuinely thrilled for her, but I felt impressed to tell her that while, yes, joining the Church is probably the best choice she has made in her whole life, she needs to be aware that it's not going to necessarily make her life easy all of a sudden. If it's easy, it's not really worth it. Said another way, "A religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> You have experienced this in a different realm as you have noticed that your favorite classes are the ones that have required you to think a little harder and dig a little deeper. &nbsp; <br /><br />The Savior never said everything will be easy if we follow Him, but He does promise rest if we yoke ourselves to Him by coupling ourselves with His teachings and attaching ourselves to His commandments.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> Discarding the teachings of Jesus Christ, giving in to personal weaknesses, or staying away from challenges is never the best path to take. It might seem easier, but if it doesn't require a sacrifice on our part, it's not worth it. &nbsp; <br /><br />Think of the things Satan would have us allow into our lives: pride, addiction, dishonesty, sin. Yoking ourselves to these snares will bring us misery and stop our progress.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> For the most part, they require very little effort from us. <br /><br />I repeat, "Trust&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;with&nbsp;all&nbsp;thine&nbsp;heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />In 1962, United States President John F. Kennedy spoke at Rice University in Houston, Texas and pointed out why it is good to do challenging things when he said, "<em>We choose to go to the Moon!</em>&nbsp;...&nbsp;We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things,&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;because they are easy,&nbsp;<em>but because they are hard</em>; because&nbsp;<em>that goal</em>&nbsp;will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because&nbsp;<em>that challenge</em>&nbsp;is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and&nbsp;<em>one we intend to win</em>&nbsp;.." &nbsp; <br /><br />Doing hard, challenging things gives us a way to measure how much we are willing to sacrifice. In your faith and in your schoolwork, don't shirk away from being challenged. &nbsp; <br /><br />Most solid decisions require sacrifice. One tool to help us combat the temptations of the adversary is sacrifice. What have you done lately that feels like a sacrifice? Maybe it's difficult for you to take the time to do the prime things (those things that some people call "Primary answers" but that I think are prime to our progress). Maybe you could sacrifice a little sleep to do those prime things! Is it hard for you to hold your tongue when others are speaking ill of someone behind their back? Put your comments on the sacrificial altar and see if that makes you feel stronger in thwarting the temptations of the adversary.&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I'd like to share the experience of one young couple who were married shortly after they each returned home from their missions. In their case, keeping the commandments went against all logic and reason and required tremendous sacrifice on their part. &nbsp; <br /><br />When they were 26 years old, the husband graduated from college with a degree in agriculture, and with their two little children, they moved home to manage the 500-acre family farm. &nbsp; <br /><br />The crops were doing very well, and in August they had the prospect of an excellent harvest, so they borrowed $65,000 and purchased 400 head of yearling calves. They knew this was a good investment because of the profit they would make from selling the calves after feeding them from this bounteous harvest. Several of the other farming families in the community also borrowed money to purchase calves. &nbsp; <br /><br />Normally they begin harvesting in this part of the country at the beginning of September, and the date of the first snowfall is around September 20. On September 1, they were ready to harvest, and it began to rain. It rained all week and began to dry out at the end of the week. On Sunday it was dry enough to start harvesting, but since it was Sunday, they delayed until Monday. On Monday it started raining again, rained all week, and began to dry out by Sunday. This continued for three weeks, and the window of time to harvest was almost closed. Each Sunday they would go to church in this farming community, and the bishop would remind the ward members that the Lord would bless them if they would honor His day, but it was still hard to see their neighbors harvesting on Sunday. <br /><br />In late September, all of their crops went under the snow, and they tried to harvest in areas where the snow was not very deep, but it was useless. <br /><br />Meanwhile, their yearling calves needed feed, but there was none. About Christmas time, they were forced to sell them and made a meager profit from the small weight gain. &nbsp; <br /><br />So with a college degree in hand, the husband had to find odd jobs to provide for his family. &nbsp; <br /><br />The first week of January, hoof and mouth disease broke out in the area, which is a very serious and infectious disease in cattle. As a result, the price of beef cattle dropped overnight from 40 cents/pound to 11 cents/pound. This was a devastating financial blow to those who had harvested their crops on Sundays and had sufficient feed to keep their cattle. The young family that had kept the Sabbath day holy and were forced to sell their cattle for a small profit suffered very little financially. &nbsp; <br /><br />Twelve years later, this couple welcomed me to their family as their youngest child. I'm sure, during that harvest season, my parents didn't realize the impact their choices would have on their entire life nor that there was a higher purpose to that experience that has shaped the lives of their children, grandchildren, and a never-ending posterity. &nbsp; <br /><br />I wonder what decisions you are making during your "decade of decision,"<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> the decade to which you will be able to pinpoint the direction your life will go. &nbsp; <br /><br />I warn you to not simplify your life so much that you eliminate the important things. Sometimes we think if we could just get rid of some of the pressures that seem to take so much extra time, energy, and discipline, life would be so much easier. And so we start to pare down and eliminate and simplify. Have you simplified the important things right out of your life, the things that could be your best tools for making good choices that will affect you and your posterity? Don't be afraid to invest in things that seem inconvenient but that are actually imperative to your progress.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> Start today, and start small. Don't expect everything in your life to be perfect because you more fully incorporated the Savior into your life, but do expect things to be better as you consistently tether yourself to Christ. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>God's Plan or Philosophies of the World</strong> <br />The last area of opposites I want to discuss is whether our decisions have us tethered to God's plan or to the philosophies of the world. <br /><br />I wholeheartedly agree with Sister Bonnie L. Oscarson, who says, "If it is the Lord's plan, it should also be our plan!"<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />An essential element to His plan is agency.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> The intention of agency is oft misunderstood. We tend to think agency means we can do whatever we want. <em>That</em> is<em> mixed up</em>! &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Agency was intended for us to prove ourselves during our life on earth while we are away from our Heavenly Father, to see if we would do everything He taught us. Agency is <em>not</em> for us to do whatever we want to do and not do whatever we don't want to do. Are you using your gift of agency the way it was intended to be used? What if you knitted a sweater for me for my birthday and a few weeks later saw me using a piece of that sweater as a rag to mop the floor? Would you think to yourself, "Wow, I'm so glad she's using that sweater in a way that works for her! I thought she would wear it, but if this is the way she wants to use it, great!"? I'm pretty sure that's not what you would be thinking. Are you using agency the way it was intended to be used? &nbsp; <br /><br />Heavenly Father gave us agency not because He doesn't care, and not because He wants us to choose whatever we want, but because He wants us to be able to prove ourselves while we are away from Him. Our success is His work and His glory. He wants us to trust Him, and, more importantly, we should want Him to trust us.<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Every decision we make either leads us closer to the Savior or away from Him. On which side of that line are your choices putting you? If they are taking you away from the Savior, His gospel, His teachings, and all He represents, I encourage you to start making choices that will bring you closer to Him. Start with the small choices. &nbsp; <br /><br />The world would have you think that the most important things to seek after are the enticing, the exciting, and the fun; that your success and happiness depend on what you can do on your own without asking God for help; that there is no need for a Savior or repentance; that families aren't the basis for His plan to help us become who He wants us to be; and that making covenants is restrictive and unnecessary. Those are all lies, and you know none of those things are true. Do not trust things that aren't true. &nbsp; <br /><br />When all is said and done, so many things come down to what you trust. What do you need to change in your life to more fully trust God and tether yourself to Him? Trust your faith. Trust making decisions that require some sacrifice. Trust in God's plan. He is the source of truth. He who created the entire universe can be trusted in every decision you make. Tether yourself to Him with heavy-duty carabineers because He is the tandem buddy that your life depends on. "In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a> "His way is the path that leads to happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come."<a href="/devotionals/trish-gannaway#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Scriptures:</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I.</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, as some of you are already aware, this morning, at 10:00 a.m., the First Presidency made a very significant announcement of great importance to BYU-Idaho.<br /><br />A new higher-education organization is being created within the Church Education System, reporting directly to Elder Kim B. Clark, Commissioner, who is with us today. This new organization will have Church-wide responsibilities for online higher education and will include many of the online programs currently administered through the BYU universities and LDSBC. The certificates and degrees will continue to be granted by the institutions whose faculty do the teaching. The new organization will be called BYU-Pathway Worldwide. &nbsp; <br /><br />Significantly, the First Presidency also announced that President Clark G. Gilbert will be the president of this new organization, BYU-Pathway Worldwide. &nbsp; <br /><br />For BYU-Idaho, the functions to be assumed by this new worldwide organization are a significant recognition and magnification of the pioneering work you have done in an area of worldwide need for the whole Church, which pioneering work is now to join with and benefit online programs at other CES institutions. &nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, you will need a new president to succeed President Gilbert at the end of your current semester. We will say more of that in a moment. &nbsp; <br /><br />For the past two years, President Clark G. Gilbert has served with great distinction as the president of BYU-Idaho. His exemplary service has earned the trust and support of the board, faculty, staff, administrators, and students of this remarkable institution. His innovative efforts to develop online programs to bless the lives of many more students are an ideal resource for his leading the new BYU-Pathway Worldwide. &nbsp; <br /><br />President Gilbert's wonderful service would not have been possible without the support and love of his dear wife, Christine. On this important occasion, we recognize and commend Sister Gilbert and their children for their dedication to BYU-Idaho and the great influence they have had upon this entire campus community. &nbsp; <br /><br />President and Sister Gilbert, would you please join me at the podium for a moment to allow all who are present to show our love and appreciation for your marvelous service. We will hear from President Gilbert later. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now we turn to the future leadership of BYU-Idaho. The officers of the board, the First Presidency, have authorized me, as Chairman of the Board's Executive Committee, to announce the necessary change of leadership of this wonderful university. The Board of Trustees has chosen an individual to serve as the new president of BYU-Idaho, who will continue to build upon the solid foundation laid by President Gilbert and his many distinguished predecessors. We are pleased to announce the appointment, as the 17th president of BYU-Idaho, of Henry J. Eyring. President Eyring will formally assume his duties on April 10, 2017. &nbsp; <br /><br />As you know, Henry J. Eyring currently serves as your Academic Vice President. He has been at BYU-Idaho for more than 10 years, serving earlier as the Advancement Vice President and even earlier as Associate Academic Vice President with responsibility for outreach and learning. His Church service has included bishop, stake president, and president of the Japan Tokyo Mission.<br /><br />President Eyring and his wife, Kelly, are the parents of five children. We warmly welcome all of them to this new assignment. Sister Eyring, would you and your family please join us on the stand. Now, would each of you join with me in welcoming the Eyring family to this new assignment.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">II.</p>
<p>I feel very privileged to have been part of this historic occasion. In behalf of the board and its officers, I welcome Henry J. Eyring as the new president of BYU-Idaho. I have known him for many years, and so have many of you. I have admired his work as an educator, and so have you who have benefited from it. He is ideally suited to be the leader of this great institution, and I urge you to listen to his counsel, benefit from his direction, and give him your wholehearted support as you go forward to new heights of service in the work of the Lord. &nbsp; <br /><br />I join each of you in commending President Clark G. Gilbert for his marvelous leadership of BYU-Idaho. Now the Lord's servants have been inspired to call him to another assignment. As I thought about what I might say to you about that, I remembered an experience I had in 1972. It concerns President Harold B. Lee. &nbsp; <br /><br />When President Lee was called as President of the Church at age 73, we expected to have him as our president for many years. If he lived as long as his predecessor, he would have been our Church president for 22 years. Then, in 1973, just 18 months after he became President of the Church, he died suddenly. Shocked, like so many others, I wondered why the Lord would release a leader so vigorous and well prepared to lead the Church in that critical time. &nbsp; <br /><br />The comfort that settled upon my soul is precisely the comfort that is available to you as you think about the sudden departure of your well-loved and highly capable President Gilbert. I was comforted with the assurance that the Lord had transferred President Lee to another important assignment on the other side of the veil, and the Lord had another very capable Apostle to take up the reins of leadership--Spencer W. Kimball. Happily, President Gilbert's transfer, which follows that same pattern, is not accomplished in the same way as President Lee's. But the principle is the same. And happily, the Lord has prepared another leader, President Henry J. Eyring, whose gifts and vision and experience at BYU-Idaho are fully equal to the great responsibility of carrying on the vital work of this wonderful university.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">III.</p>
<p>You live in challenging times, including the political uncertainties attending a new administration in Washington. More important, values and standards honored for thousands of years are now being denied or cast aside. Selfishness is replacing service. Evil is being called good, and good is being called evil. &nbsp; <br /><br />Though men's hearts are failing them, you should take heart. There have always been challenging times. We, the generations of your predecessors, have survived daunting challenges, and so will you. The answer to all of these challenges is the same as it has always been. We have a Savior, and He has taught us what we should do. At the conclusion of His earthly ministry, He declared, "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). &nbsp; <br /><br />What overcomes the world is the power of God, manifested through His Son Jesus Christ and given to us through the principles and doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. That is what makes this university possible. &nbsp; <br /><br />In the stressful circumstances that surround us, we must trust in God and His promises and hold fast to the vital gospel teaching of hope. As the Apostle Paul told the Corinthians,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. (2 Corinthians 4:8-9)</p>
<p>When we trust in the Lord that all will work out, this hope keeps us moving. Hope is a characteristic Christian virtue. I know it will counter all current despairs. When you feel down, put faith and hope to work in your lives. While others may abandon progress, you of faith should hope on and press on with your education, your lives, and your families. As the Lord said to our early Church members, "Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if you are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail" (D&amp;C 6:34).<br /><br /></p>

<p>General Authority Seventy</p>
<p>Elder Kim B. Clark was sustained as a General Authority Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 4, 2015. At the time of his call he had been serving as the president of Brigham Young University-Idaho since 2005. He served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy, Idaho Area, from 2007 to 2014. He is currently serving as the Church Commissioner of Education.<br /><br />Elder Clark received a bachelor of arts, a master of arts, and a PhD, all in economics, from Harvard University. He became a faculty member at the Harvard Business School in 1978 and was named dean of that school in 1995. He served in that capacity until the summer of 2005, when he was named the president of Brigham Young University-Idaho.<br /><br />Elder Clark has served in a number of Church callings, including full-time missionary in the South German Mission, elders quorum president, ward executive secretary, counselor in a bishopric, bishop, high councilor, and counselor in a stake mission presidency.<br /><br />Kim Bryce Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on March 20, 1949. He married Sue Lorraine Hunt in June 1971. They are the parents of seven children. <br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is another great day at BYU-Idaho. It is, actually. It is a tremendous day. I was asked by Elder Oaks a few days ago to say a few words at this historic occasion, and I've been pondering what I should say. But I got a very clear message from the Lord. I, today, am to bear witness of the Lord Jesus Christ, for in this day and in these actions you can see firsthand, and you are witnesses of, a promise He made long ago at the very beginning of the restoration. <br /><br />In 1832, when there were very few members of the Church, the Lord gave to the Prophet Joseph this marvelous passage of scripture, the 84th section. And in this section, the very end, the Lord said this to Joseph and to us: He said, "For I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to exert the powers of heaven; ye cannot see it now, yet a little while and ye should see it, and know that I am, and that I am and that I will come and reign with my people" (D&amp;C 84:119). &nbsp; <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, what's happened today--the creation of BYU-Pathway Worldwide and the call of President Gilbert and Sister Gilbert to leave Rexburg, which they love with all their hearts and would--if they could, they would stay here forever, but the Lord has called them to serve in this new role. And you can also see the call of Henry J. Eyring and his dear wife, Kelly, to now serve as the president of BYU-Idaho. You can see the Lord's hand. The Lord has been at work for a long time, preparing this place and preparing these great brothers and sisters to serve Him in this new way for a long time. Many of you know in the 1930s, when the Church was in serious financial distress, the Church gave this institution back to the community for a couple of years, providing no financial support, and even tried to give this institution to the state of Idaho. That gift was voted upon the Senate of Idaho three times, and the last time it failed by one vote. If it had not failed, this place would have become a state college. As it was, it stayed Ricks College and could be then prepared by the Lord to become this great university. The Lord has been at work to prepare President and Sister Gilbert, amazingly, all along for years, years, and years, preparing them to do His work, and He has been preparing Kelly and President Eyring to serve this great place. President Eyring wasn't kidding when he was talking about decades. He was a little boy on this campus; he walked the halls and the sidewalks in a much smaller place when he was just a boy, never imagining as a six- or seven-year-old boy that one day he would stand at this pulpit. But the Lord knew, and the Lord has been watching over him and preparing him to be the president of His great institution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, brothers and sisters, that's my message. God watches over you in exactly the same way. Every one of you is precious in His sight. He has work for every one of you to do. Every one of you has responsibilities and opportunities to serve Him in His kingdom, to do work that will bless the lives of literally thousands and tens of thousands in your time here in mortality. You are here in this place by His design. He has watched over you and brought you here to come to know Him and love Him, that your testimony of Him might grow deeper in your heart, that your commitment to do what He wants done will be powerful and strong when you leave here, that you will go out and build His kingdom, because you will know what it means to live in Zion because you have been here in this sacred place. &nbsp; <br /><br />And so I leave you my witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer. He is the head of this church. He watches over and guides it and leads it in a very powerful, personal, and intimate way. I know He lives. I love Him. I am grateful for Him. I pray that we all will feel His love and grow and deepen our commitment to do what He wants done, for in His plan and in his way is life and truth in this life and eternal life in the world to come. In the sacred name of our Lord and our Savior, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>BYU-Idaho President-elect</p>
<p>Henry J. Eyring earned degrees in geology, business administration and law from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. He has worked at Monitor Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a strategy consultant; at BYU-Provo as an MBA director; and at BYU-Idaho as associate academic vice president over online learning, advancement vice president and his most recent role as academic vice president.<br /><br />President Eyring's time with BYU-Idaho extends back to 1971, when his father, Henry B. Eyring of the Church's First Presidency, was president of Ricks College (now known as BYU-Idaho).<br /><br />President Eyring and his wife, Kelly, are the parents of five children.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is unexpected in many ways, not the least to see my son Henry Christian and his wife Brooke here. They, as far as I knew, were in Boston today. I'm crying both for the joy of their sacrifice and also to think what it might have cost them to get here. We'll talk about that later. <br /><br />I am grateful for today's historic announcement of the creation of BYU-Pathway Worldwide, and the appointment of my dear friend, Clark Gilbert, as its founding president. &nbsp;I have been blessed to work with President Gilbert both professionally and ecclesiastically over three decades. I know of no one of greater heart and energy, character, and enthusiasm. Like you, I am inspired by the mission of the newly created BYU-Pathway Worldwide. As President Gilbert and his colleagues go forward now in their mission to take education to a worldwide church, we at BYU-Idaho will be a kind of home ward to them, supplying essential support. I'm grateful for consecrated colleagues on this campus who already support Pathway's mission with online curriculum and academic services. We have felt the blessing of providing this support, and we will strive for continued inspiration in increasing the university's capacity, according to prophetic pronouncements and promises made over many decades. &nbsp; <br /><br />I'm also grateful to my BYU-Idaho colleagues for their unstinting service to ever more students on this campus. I have enjoyed the sweet fruits of their labors in a very personal way through three of my children who are well-educated and appreciative BYU-Idaho alumni. This campus, generations now, has been hallowed ground to my family. &nbsp; <br /><br />We look forward to continued service in this richly blessed portion of the Lord's vineyard.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BYU-Idaho President</p>
<p>Clark G. Gilbert became the 16<sup>th</sup> president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in April 2015. <br /><br />President Gilbert brings a range of academic and professional experiences to his assignment in Rexburg. Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho in 2015, President Gilbert served as CEO of Deseret News Publishing Company and Deseret Digital Media. He also served as an associate academic vice president at BYU-Idaho, overseeing the implementation of online learning and the Pathway program. As a deeply committed teacher, President Gilbert had administrative responsibility for the Learning Model at BYU-Idaho. Prior to coming to Rexburg, he was a professor of entrepreneurial management at the Harvard Business School where he taught and studied in the field of organizational innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gilbert graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor's degree in International Relations. He earned a master's degree in East Asian Studies from Stanford University and a doctorate degree in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gilbert has served in multiple ecclesiastical roles, including counselor in a stake presidency, bishop, counselor in a bishopric, Young Men's president, Gospel Doctrine teacher, and Scoutmaster. He currently teaches the CTR 9 Primary class with his wife, Christine.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gilbert was born in California and raised in Arizona. He and his wife, Christine, are the parents of eight children.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you, President Eyring and Elder Oaks. We love BYU-Idaho. In Mosiah, chapter 18, verse 30, it reads, "And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon, yea, by the waters of Mormon, in the forest...of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer." <br /><br /> I know this is a sacred place, as President Eyring has suggested. Sister Gilbert often has said to the students of BYU-Idaho, "You are in the right place." When we left here six years ago, we just prayed we had enough of Rexburg in us. Once again, we will be leaving; and I hope, like so many students here, that when we leave, there will be enough Rexburg in all of us. <br /><br />To the BYU-Idaho employees, we love you. We have learned so much from you. We will continue to work together. I appreciate President Eyring mentioning the relationship between BYU-Pathway Worldwide and BYU-Idaho. We will continue to be intricately connected. &nbsp;<br />I would also like to speak a word of appreciation to the BYU-Idaho Pathway team. This will have tremendous impact on each of you. I want you to know we are praying for you. The creation of this university was an event that was born of sacrifice. So will be the case of the creation of BYU-Pathway Worldwide. <br /><br />I want to share with you briefly an experience I had two weeks ago as I listened to Elder Oaks and Elder Holland speak. In that setting, we were taught about the mission in the Muddy, when Brigham Young came to stake conferences throughout the early Church in Utah and called people right out of stake conference and asked them to serve on the mission in the Muddy. By the description of it, you can guess it may not have been the most desirable place to relocate. The story goes that one daughter started to cry as she realized all that would change in her life. The girl next to her said, "Why are you crying? My dad was called too. There's no way we're going." And then the first girl said, "My dad wouldn't be my dad if he wouldn't go." <br /><br />I hope that all of you watch this and know that in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, when we are asked to do hard things, we rise up, we do them, and the Lord blesses us. <br /><br />I also wanted to add my confirmation that President Henry J. Eyring is prepared in unique ways to lead this university. I have sat by his side and received his counsel. He knows and loves this university. He will be a tremendous leader in this university, and I commend him unto you. I also thank my family and Sister Gilbert for their great service. Accepting this new responsibility would not be possible without them. <br /><br />In closing, I would just reiterate the mission of BYU-Idaho, which is develop disciples of the Savior Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities. I want you to know that, above all, Sister Gilbert and I have a testimony of the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ. We know He lives. We know He loves us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>

<p>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
<p>Elder Neil Linden Andersen was named an Apostle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 4, 2009.<br /><br /> Elder Andersen was serving as the senior member of the Presidency of the Seventy prior to his calling to the Quorum of the Twelve. He was named a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy in April 1993, at age 41. He previously led the work of the Church in southern Brazil and, again as a member of an Area Presidency, oversaw the Church in western Europe. He has also assisted in supervising the work of the Church in Mexico and Central America. In addition, he supervised Church audiovisual production, including the filming of&nbsp;<em>The Testaments: Of One Fold and One Shepherd</em>, and managed construction of the broadcast facilities in the Conference Center as the Executive Director of the Church Audiovisual Department. He speaks French, Portuguese, and Spanish in addition to his native English. Prior to his call as a General Authority, Elder Andersen served as a mission president in the France Bordeaux Mission and as president of the Tampa Florida Stake. <br /><br />Elder Andersen was born in Logan, Utah, on August 9, 1951, and was raised in Pocatello, Idaho. <br /><br />He graduated from Brigham Young University, where he was a Hinckley Scholar, and earned a master's of business administration from Harvard University. After completing his education, he settled in Tampa, Florida, where his business interests included advertising, real estate development, and health care. <br /><br />Elder Andersen and his wife, Kathy Williams Andersen, are the parents of four children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you so much for who you are and for what you're becoming. We love you very much. I bring you the love of President Thomas S. Monson, the First Presidency, and the Quorum of the Twelve and express our deep and abiding love for you. <br /><br /> Happy Valentine's Day! It's a beautiful day. I want you to meet my valentine. <br /><br />Kathy, please come up here. Today is a day when we think of love and romance and kindness and friendship, right? And I would just like to say that I love her very, very much. We've had 43 Valentine's Days together, 42 that we've been married, and I've never had a Valentine's Day when I didn't get a very beautiful card, beautiful gifts, and, more important, beautiful hugs. Kathy, would you say something? <strong><em><br /></em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong><strong><em>Sister Andersen:</em></strong> We lived in France for a number of years, and loosely translated into English my favorite few lines from a French poem are "I love you more today than yesterday, but less than tomorrow." That is how I feel about this man, whom I love so much, and I'm so thankful for him, so thankful that he is my valentine. <br /><br />President Gilbert shared with you a few facts about my husband's life, and I would like to talk just a minute about him. It's been almost eight years since his call to the holy apostleship, and it's been a very sacred, very humbling time in our lives. When Jesus was on the earth, He called men to be His disciples, to bear testimony of Him in all the world. I bear my testimony to you today of my husband's sacred calling. He is an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. <br /><br />I have been an eyewitness to the preparation that has come in the talk that he will give to you today. I have seen him up in the middle of night, I have seen him on his knees, and I bear testimony to you today of the words spoken in the Doctrine and Covenants: "What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> <br /><br />As you hear the words that he will speak today, I bear testimony to you that they are the words that the Savior would have you hear, for he is truly one of His disciples and an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <strong><em><br /></em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong><strong><em>Elder Andersen:</em></strong> Today is Valentine's Day. You might know about the BYU-Idaho English student who received a B-minus on an important paper. In hopes of bettering his grade, and in the spirit of the Valentine's season, he left for his professor an extravagant heart-shaped box of chocolates with a preprinted inscription: "Be Mine." The following day he received in return a Valentine from the teacher. It read, "Thank you, but your grade is still be mine-us."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> <br /><br />A wonderful romance story was told to me by Elder Octaviano Tenorio, an emeritus General Authority from Mexico. He told me that he was getting into his late-20s, and his prospects for marriage were not improving. He met Rosa and wondered what he could do to impress her. Finally, he wrote her a long letter. Knowing that she was very devoted to the gospel, he explained: "Rosa, I know that I am not very handsome. I'm not very smooth in my conversations. And you are right to wonder about my athletic ability. But I want you to know that this is just mortality. In the Resurrection, I will be the physical equivalent of Brad Pitt." <br /><br />Actually, Octaviano is from a different generation, so his comparison was Paul Newman. Many of you probably do not know who that is. But Octaviano won Rosa's hand. <br /><br />I am the luckiest man in the world. For 43 years, my dear, precious, sweetheart, Kathy, has been my Valentine. And to quote a well-known poem:<em><br /></em><em></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Kathy, "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. ...</em> <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>"I love thee with the breath,</em> <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>"Smiles, tears, of all my life!--and, if God choose[s],</em> <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>"I shall but love thee better after death</em>."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>As it is Valentine's Day, we will talk more about love and romance, but let me start by talking about your future. Every person who has ever been born into mortality and is able to live his or her life into adulthood will experience both happiness and sadness; peace and challenges; good and evil. Whatever the generation, life has its highs and lows. <br /><br />Those living in Italy in the late 15th century experienced both the pain and unfairness of the Spanish Inquisition and the beauty of the opening of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. <br /><br />A young man or woman arriving in America on the ship <em>Mayflower</em> in 1620 would have been very excited as he or she stepped foot onto a new land. Later, as the settlers faced the harsh New England winters, they would have wondered if they had made the right decision to come. <br /><br />Those living in 1929 experienced the amazing discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in the same year as the complete collapse of the U.S. stock market. <br /><br />In recent times, 2001 brought both the terrorist attacks of September 11 and the first draft of the completed human genome, opening the door to the cures of many diseases. <br /><br />The year 2017 is now upon us. Your days, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">these</span> days in which you live are some of the most amazing that this world has ever seen. The appearance of the Father and the Son to the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove in 1820 brought the Restoration of the gospel and the dispensation of the fulness of times. You know why you are here and what the Lord expects of you. You have the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the priesthood of God is upon the earth. The Lord indicated to the Prophet Joseph Smith that it would not be just a time of spiritual revelations but also a time of understanding and progress in all areas. The Lord promised knowledge "that [had] not been revealed since the world was."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> <br /><br />These wonders would include remarkable achievements in science, medicine, manufacturing, transportation, and communication. <br /><br />William J. Bernstein, a noted financial theorist and neurologist by training (not a member of the Church), wrote about what he saw in the world's economic history: "When we look at the [facts], it becomes crystal clear that <em>something happened</em> ... in the early nineteenth century. ... [Up] until approximately 1820, per capita world economic growth [the single best way of measuring human material progress] registered near zero. ... Then, not long after 1820, prosperity began flowing in an ever-increasing torrent; with each successive generation, the life of the [child] became observably more comfortable, informed, and predictable than that of the father."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> <br /><br />I hold in my hand an example of the amazing blessing of technology--my iPhone. This small device is a mobile phone, a planner, a GPS, and a digital camera. It includes videoconferencing, books and newspapers, a video and music player, and so much more. There are apps for banking, word processing, social media, video games, and a thousand other purposes. Just the other day I was skiing with my son-in-law. As we started up the chairlift for the last run of the day, he said to me, "Dad, I'm going to go ahead and warm up the car." He pulled out his iPhone, and with the touch of his finger, his car more than a mile away started its heater, melted the snow off its windows, and prepared itself for our travel home. <br /><br />Advances in science, medicine, manufacturing, transportation, and communication will continue throughout your lifetime. There will be variety in entertainment and innovation never imagined. These are your days, and it's a beautiful time to be alive. <br /><br />However, in this time of prosperity and advancement, there are also real challenges. You live in a world that is sometimes divisive and contentious. Information is everywhere, and with it, a host of enticing voices attempts to pull you one way and then another. There is confusion and commotion, with many moving away from God and His commandments and away from the Savior. Think about these U.S. statistics:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Believe in God: my generation--81 percent; your generation--64 percent <br /><br />Believe Jesus is God or the Son of God: my generation--74 percent; your generation--58 percent <br /><br />Believe in the Resurrection of Jesus Christ: my generation--72 percent; your generation--55 percent <br /><br />You hear and read on your mobile devices the exact words of those who shot the arrows at Samuel: "It is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come"<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a>--or that an angel would deliver the Book of Mormon to the Prophet Joseph. <br /><br />You hear and read on your mobile devices modern-day Korihors saying or texting, "[You] that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope, why do ye yoke yourselves with such foolish things?"<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> <br /><br />Your days are a time of sifting in the Church. It will be very important for your eternal welfare that, as the Apostle Paul said, you are grounded, rooted, established, and settled in spiritual things.<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> <br /><br />There are great privileges, possibilities, and opportunities in this wonderful time of life. I admire you and respect you for your worthiness and preparations in being here at BYU-Idaho. <br /><br />Be wise in what you are learning. In today's environment, you need to know how to think, adjust, and mold yourself to a changing world. Be disciplined in planning your courses to ensure a timely graduation. Whether you are a young man or a young woman, you should be sharpening your professional skills, strengthening your ability to work on a team, exercising your mind so it is adept at many subjects, disciplining your commitment to work, and fortifying your character so you can be trusted with responsibility. I would advise my own sons <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and daughters</span> to prepare professionally. Women in this audience may be in a position to choose to use your unlimited intelligence, talents, and capacities full-time in strengthening your own children in your home, but in the event that is not your situation, you need to prepare to compete in the world should it be necessary. <br /><br />Even more important than your professional preparation is your spiritual preparation: prayer; the word of God; the importance of honesty, purity, and faith. <br /><br />As you seek to be grounded and settled, I repeat the advice given to you just one month ago by President Russell M. Nelson in his worldwide devotional for young adults. You will remember when he said this: <br /><br />"How can you <em>increase</em> in your discipleship? I have an invitation for you that will help--it's an assignment, actually--if you choose to accept it. Commence tonight to consecrate a portion of your time each week to studying <em>everything</em> Jesus said and did.&nbsp;... <br /><br />"This may seem like a large assignment, but I encourage you to accept it." Now, listen to his promise. President Nelson continues: "If you proceed to learn <em>all</em> you can about Jesus Christ, I promise you that your love for Him, and for God's laws, will grow beyond what you currently imagine. I promise you also that your ability to turn away from sin will increase. Your desire to keep the commandments will soar. You will find yourself better able to walk away from the entertainment and entanglements of those who mock the followers of Jesus Christ."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> <br /><br />I add my witness to this counsel and promise given to you by the President of the Quorum of the Twelve--a man whom we sustain as a prophet, seer, and revelator. Follow his counsel and you will see the realization of the blessings he promised you. <br /><br />The journey ahead will be a joyful journey if you will ground yourself spiritually and be diligent in your professional preparations. Oh, there will be challenges, but there will be tremendous happiness and beautiful satisfactions. There is no better time, no better place, no better conditions to live out your mortality than now. <br /><br />I realize that you come from many countries and many different situations. What I have said applies to all here today. <br /><br />Now, because it's Valentine's Day, I want to speak about love and marriage. Some of you are already married, and some of you will yet marry. My hope for you is that your marriage will be strong and loving, committed to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Some of you may not marry during the course of your mortality. But for all, regardless of marital status, there can be great happiness if we keep the commandments of God. Look forward with hope, and don't be fearful of what lies ahead. If you prepare yourself and are spiritually grounded, your future will be bright. <br /><br />The Savior said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If a man [loves] me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. . . . <br /><br />". . . Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a></p>
<p>I know this is true. <br /><br />I would now like to share a few thoughts with those of you who are not married but are in the exciting, thrilling, wonderful, and sometimes frightening and intimidating process of finding the person with whom you will ultimately spend the rest of your mortality and all of eternity. This can be a very sacred and deeply satisfying experience in your life. <br /><br />My first advice to you is to be courageous. Push yourself to develop one-on-one friendships--young men with young women, and young women with young men. You don't need to think every friendship will necessarily develop into romance, but much will be discovered in the one-on-one interaction. <br /><br />There are many traditions that need to be expanded. For example, in our culture it is still the norm that the young men generally invite young women to spend time together, one-on-one. Young women, you may need to step forward and not be afraid of forming a friendship with someone in a classroom or in a ward without pushing it to become more than that. There are many young men who have little history in meeting and forming close friendships with young women one-on-one. <br /><br />You young men may need to push yourselves through uncomfortable feelings to form these friendships. You have to be willing to speak, interact, and enjoy activities, one young woman with one young man. Group activities are not sufficient. Some years ago, Elder Dallin H. Oaks made this comment: "We counsel you to channel your associations with the opposite sex into dating patterns that have the potential to mature into marriage, not hanging-out patterns that only have the prospect to mature into team sports like touch football. Marriage is not a group activity--at least not until the children come along in goodly numbers."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> <br /><br />Elder Robert D. Hales later added: "Dating is the opportunity for lengthy conversations. When you date, learn everything you can about each other. Get to know each other's families when possible. Are your goals compatible? Do you share the same feelings about the commandments, the Savior, the priesthood, the temple, parenting, callings in the Church, and serving others? Have you observed one another under stress, responding to success and failure, resisting anger, and dealing with setbacks? Does the person you are dating tear others down or build them up? Is his or her attitude and language and conduct what you would like to live with every day?"<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> <br /><br />When you desire to expand a relationship beyond friendship into romance, it is so important that the laws of purity, discipline, and chastity are obeyed. Three weeks ago, a mother and her daughter came to my office. The young woman had been a freshman at BYU-Idaho. She came to Rexburg with all the hopes and dreams of every Latter-day Saint, but somehow she and a returned missionary had gotten too involved with one another and now both have been dismissed from school and she was on her way home with her mother. How could it happen? <br /><br />You know that you have strong physical emotions and passions that must be controlled and carefully governed to avoid excessive kissing or any kind of inappropriate touching. I assure you as an Apostle of the Lord that excusing yourself because you feel you care so much for one another, and moving inappropriately close to breaking the law of chastity, will not help you in the very important spiritual choice you are hoping to make. Your mind, your heart, and your spiritual senses will be clouded. Set your limits. Plant those limits deep into all you do together, so that they cannot be run over or moved aside as you feel strong emotion for each other. <br /><br />Next, don't be afraid to take a chance with someone who might not be an obvious choice. When Kathy and I began to know one another, to me she was not only a person of very deep faith and intelligence, but she was also a Florida princess. She wore nice clothes and had a certain sophistication. I was an Idaho farm boy. I came from a small dairy farm just north of Pocatello, in the little community of Tyhee. <br /><br />I have told young audiences before that one of my few advantages was that I had served my mission in France and young women liked to be spoken to in French. But I realized, as I got to know Kathy, that I had not learned the romantic words of love on my mission. So I would just start with "Ma ch&egrave;re," and then in a romantic cadence, I would recite the missionary discussion: "Je voudrais vous inviter a venir &agrave; l'&eacute;glise s'il vous pla&icirc;t." A person must use the advantages he has. <br /><br />So Kathy took a chance on me. I am sure my background was different from what she thought her potential husband would have. We don't have to meet only those who come from backgrounds just like our own. We look deeper and further into who they are and who they will become. <br /><br />I love this quote by President David O. McKay, who was the Lord's prophet upon the earth when I entered my first year at the university. Speaking to the men, he said: <br /><br />"If you meet a girl in whose presence you feel a desire to achieve, who inspires you to do your best, and to make the most of yourself, such a young woman is worthy of your love.&nbsp;... <br /><br />". . . In her presence you do not attempt to take advantage of her; in her presence you feel that you would like to be everything that [you] should become, for she will inspire you to that ideal."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> <br /><br />There are four words I want you to remember: complete honesty, unselfish humility. <br /><br />Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has said, "True love blooms when we care more about another person than we care about ourselves."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> <br /><br />As you progress in your dating to seriously considering sharing your lives together, you share your most private thoughts, your dreams, and your fears. You share who you are, who you have been, and who you want to become. Complete honesty and unselfish humility. If you struggle with pornography or have struggled in the past, a person considering you as an eternal companion deserves to know about your challenge and how you have faced it. If you have had difficulty with other addictions, keeping the law of chastity, lying or stealing, humility and honesty urges that you give to the person you love the opportunity to spiritually and prayerfully weigh the choices of going forward, before a proposal is accepted and announced. <br /><br />Here is a fair question: to be completely honest, does everything that has ever happened have to be said? You use your wisdom and good judgment. If you took Nancy's bubblegum out of her desk in the sixth grade without her permission, the subject can probably be forgotten. But if you had a two-year struggle with pornography, then that is more important. A thoughtful approach is to ask yourself what you would want to know if you were in the place of your companion, prayerfully preparing to spend your life with someone you love. <br /><br />Something from years in the past might be quickly understood and create no obstacle at all. If the problem or weakness or sin is more recent, it may cause the other to slow down the relationship and allow for more time and more experience in judging whether he or she is ready to move forward. It may require more prayer, discussions with parents or trusted leaders, and more experience with the person you hope to have with you forever. <br /><br />We should remember that no one is perfect. All of us have made mistakes. As the person you love speaks honestly to you, respect the courage that he or she is showing. If something is clearly in the past, keep this scripture in your heart: "He who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> <br /><br />I quote once again from Elder Holland: "No serious courtship or engagement or marriage is worth the name if we do not fully invest <em>all</em> that we have in it and in so doing trust ourselves totally to the one we love. You cannot succeed in love if you keep one foot out on the bank for safety's sake. The very nature of the endeavor requires that you hold on to each other as tightly as you can and jump in the pool together. In that spirit, . . . I want to impress upon you the vulnerability and delicacy of your partner's future as it is placed in your hands for safekeeping--male and female, it works both ways."<a href="/devotionals/elder-neil-l-andersen-winter-2017#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> <br /><br />Complete honesty, unselfish humility. <br /><br />I have addressed a serious topic. I want to end with a very happy story. <br /><br />Kathy Williams has been my valentine for 43 years. Next month we will celebrate our 42nd wedding anniversary. President Gilbert said we have 4 children, 16 grandchildren. At your age, we became grounded, rooted, and settled. Whatever came, we would face it together. Our life has not been without challenges that sometimes seemed as big as mountains. But through these many years, we have loved our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, and we have loved one another. She has been a perfect angel. I have been far less. <br /><br />The thought of having Kathy by my side forever stirs and illuminates my soul. I love her more than words can say. "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways." There are too many to count. She is my valentine today, tomorrow, and always. <br /><br />I give you my sure witness that Jesus is the Christ, that He is the Son of God, and that His gospel is the way to happiness. <br /><br />I promise you happiness and peace as you keep the commandments. I bless you that as you follow the counsel you have heard from this pulpit and felt from on high today, heaven will bless you in your decisions and in your eternal associations. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Many years ago, my wife and I were at a music concert at the outdoor square known as Residenzplatz in Salzburg, Austria. The square was very crowded, making it impossible for my five-foot-six-inch wife to see anything other than the people standing in front of her. So she carefully climbed atop my shoulders and was able to see the stage, and we enjoyed the concert together. <br /><br /> <img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional_Graphics/2017%20Winter/Richardson,%20Matthew/Images/" height="325" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Graphic-1_225x325.jpg" width="225" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a letter to Robert Hooke in 1676, Sir Isaac Newton wrote, "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> I have come to love this phrase as it evokes imagery that provides powerful and enlightening thoughts. For example, we see here a person with unobstructed views.<br />&nbsp;<img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional_Graphics/2017%20Winter/Richardson,%20Matthew/Images/" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Graphic-2_300x225.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />With clear vision they see a world of seemingly unlimited possibilities--independent of any other. In many ways, this could have been Isaac Newton, who was and still is considered to be among the most influential thinkers and scientists in history. But Newton had the rare ability to recognize that he was building upon the contributions of others that changed his sightline.</p>
<p><br /><img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional_Graphics/2017%20Winter/Richardson,%20Matthew/Images/" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Graphic-3_300x225.jpg" width="300" /> <br />He also realized that they built upon the contributions of others, who also built upon the contributions of those before them.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional_Graphics/2017%20Winter/Richardson,%20Matthew/Images/" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Graphic-4_300x225.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />And so on and so forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;<img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional_Graphics/2017%20Winter/Richardson,%20Matthew/Images/" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Graphic-5_300x225.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />Sadly, we live in a time where many do not make the connection between their opportunities to live in peace, make choices, have educational opportunities, enjoy the freedom to discover, earn a living, recreate, and dream, with the contributions of others. I have come to realize that much of what I see and experience today is possible, in large part, because I am perched atop the accomplishments, hard work, efforts, sacrifices, and ideals of those who have gone before me. <br /><br />Sometimes the shoulders that have impacted us most are not readily recognized, for they are buried in the heaps of generations past. <br /><br />&nbsp;<img alt="../../../Volumes/Devotional_Graphics/2017%20Winter/Richardson,%20Matthew/Images/" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Graphic-6_300x225.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />Not long ago, President Gilbert recognized the shoulders of those upon which you, here at BYU-Idaho, stand. He said, "At BYU-Idaho we draw on that same pioneer's heart, a gift of the early settlers who came to this valley and eventually founded this college." President Gilbert continued, "The pioneer's heart has been preserved by the Lord in the very location of this campus...'for such a time as this' when the Lord would significantly expand His educational gathering across the Church." With so much happening on this campus, it would be foolish not to stand on the shoulders of those that contributed so much to your success. <br /><br />My mother often reminded me that our family stood proudly and squarely upon the shoulders of our Danish ancestors. She loved to tell us that we are of "pioneer stock" and share their stories. These pioneer stories were usually filled with unbearable challenges, setbacks, and seemingly impossible odds. And at the end of the day, they circled their wagons, built a fire, sang, and danced--or at least, that's the way I remembered the stories. And what was their theme song? "Come, Come, Ye Saints" (<em>Hymns</em>, no. 30)<em>. </em>I always thought this was a strange theme song for those who were hungry, fatigued, and at the brink of devastation. After all, one verse reads, "And should we die before our journey's through, Happy day! All is well." <br /><br />All is well? Anybody could see that <em>all</em> was not well. And besides, most motivational songs do not have "death," "happy day," <em>and </em>"all is well" in the same sentence. As a teen, I wondered, just who were these overly optimistic people anyway? I believe that most, if not all, of us assume they must have been exceptional and even possibly super humans, which leaves most of us feeling and thinking, "Unlike me." While their shoulders were stout enough, I hope you will not think that you wouldn't measure up in comparison. "But Brother Richardson," you may interject, "I'm no Brigham Young, Captain Moroni, or Thomas Monson. I'm about as ordinary as they come." If you are feeling this way, then draw upon your BYU-Idaho pioneer heritage and stand tall on the shoulders of John L. Clark, president of this institution from 1944 to 1971. He believed that this school "was founded upon the firm belief there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people." <br /><br />Years ago, I was sitting on the stand in a chapel in Europe singing "Come, Come, Ye Saints<em>.</em>"<em> </em>A leader leaned over and whispered, "You know, the Polish translation of this song is quite different from the English version." "Really?" I countered. He said, "It doesn't really read 'All is well! All is well!'" I looked at him somewhat surprised. "The actual translation," he explained, "is 'Not so bad! Not so bad!'"<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a><br /><br />I couldn't help but quietly chuckle. Maybe the pioneers were pretty ordinary after all--just like me. Maybe everything wasn't always "well," but with their expanded vision and tremendous dedication, they <em>could </em>say, "This is not so bad...not so bad." Then with a deep breath, and renewed and relentless courage, they took yet another step and continued to forge ahead just as their ancestors did before them. Oh, to stand on the shoulders of giants and <em>to be a pioneer. </em> <br /><br />Our opening song today is a reminder that we are all pioneers. Of course, "You don't have to push a handcart, leave your family dear, or walk a thousand miles or more, to be a pioneer." A pioneer, by definition, is not merely "one who crosses the plains or homesteads," but also one who "ventures into unknown or unclaimed territory; opens up new areas of thought, research, or development; or leads the way, blazes new trails." This sounds a lot like you. So with this in mind, I turn to the second verse of "To Be a Pioneer<em>.</em>" "You <em>do</em> [have] to have great courage, faith to conquer fear, and work with might for a cause that's right, to be a pioneer!"<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> I would like to frame my remarks on those three simple but core principles outlined in this simple song. With your indulgence, however, I will present them in a slightly different order. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>1. Work with might for a cause that's right</strong> &nbsp; <br />At the core of any pioneering is <em>work</em>. Elder Neal A. Maxwell reminded us, "The gospel of work is part of 'the fulness of the gospel,'" and noted, "I have not seen any perspiration-free shortcuts to the celestial kingdom; there is no easy escalator to take us there."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> <br /><br />The Savior taught the early saints, "There is <em>a law</em>, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated-- And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> What is the law<em> </em>spoken in this verse? Consider Paul's teachings to the Galatians as he said, "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> It appears then, that the irrevocable law<em> </em>is the law of the harvest. Elder Robert D. Hales explained that "the law of the harvest is simply that you don't get something for nothing in life."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> Reaping what you sow, getting out what you put in, or obtaining what you pay for has been the modus operandi from the very beginning--even before the Creation of the world. Now, that's "old school!" No wonder President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said, "What we sow, we reap. That is the law of heaven. That is the law of God's harvest."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> <em></em> <br /><br />It is critical to understand that this law is <em>irrevocable </em>or, in other words, "not able to be changed, reversed, or recovered; final." Why make such a big deal about this? It is because the debate about the finality of the irrevocable law rages on. I remember my father teaching me that "honesty is the best policy" and that "cheaters never win." "But Dad," I whined in junior high school, "everybody cheats, and they are the ones that are always winning!" He also taught me that if you keep the word of wisdom, you will "run and not be weary ... walk and not faint" (D&amp;C 89:20). "But dad," I whined in high school, "all my teammates break the word of wisdom, and they actually run <em>really</em> fast. And besides, not one of them has fainted on the field." We can all recite instances when the law of the harvest seemed like it was defunct. The slovenly get the job, jerks get the girls, slackers get the A's, and the unemployed or underemployed seem to drive the best cars. And then there are those people that eat three dozen doughnuts with ice cream on top, wash it down with a soda, and somehow remain lean, mean, fighting machines. What can be said about this so-called evidence? <br /><br />"Be not deceived." Regardless of what you think you see or do, all efforts will be matched. Remember all the times when the law of the harvest did work. "God will not be mocked." Things will work out, as they should. And the old-fashioned pioneer grit still yields solid results. You see, "Old school is <em>still </em>good school." Your heritage has proven that. <br /><br />Because of this, Paul encouraged, "Let us not be weary in well doing: for in <em>due season</em> we shall reap, if we faint not."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> I like Paul's certain promise that "we shall reap," because I like blessings, and I always have. But wait a minute. What did he mean by "in due season?" And what about the phrase "faint not"? I gained a better view and understanding of this heavenly law by climbing atop my parents' shoulders when I was 12 years old. <br /><br />I loved snow skiing and found myself in a sporting goods store standing in front of a rack of brand new skis. One particular pair of skis seemed to call out my name, sing the Sirens' captivating song, and whisper, "Buy me!" I knew at that moment that I was meant to call these skis my own. Unfortunately, I didn't have the funds for a cheeseburger, let alone a pair of skis. So I found my mother in the mall, brought her to the sporting goods store, and stood her in front of the skis so she too could receive revelation and do what every inspired mother should do--buy skis for their beloved children. I stood next to her looking at the skis, waiting for the big moment. Nothing! No whispers, no singing, no light shining on the skis, nothing! Undeterred, I made my emotional plea, asking her to fulfill my dreams, and reminded her of her role as a good, honorable mother. Nothing! I told her it was her duty to help her children to be happy. Nothing! She finally turned, looked at me, and said calmly, "Matt, you'll appreciate these skis more if you earn the money to buy them yourself."&nbsp; <br /><br />What? I tried in vain to convince her that I <em>would </em>appreciate the skis if she bought them, and besides, where would I be able to earn money--I was 12 years old! Since Mom said no, then obviously I should ask Dad. Nothing! Well, actually he did say, "Matt, you'll appreciate these skis more if you earn the money to buy them yourself." <br /><br />I was convinced this was a conspiracy. Not long afterward, I found work on a local farm. I pulled and shucked garlic, fed chickens, and helped load the farmer's truck for market at 5:00 a.m. A neighbor saw me working early in the morning and asked if I was interested in stocking frozen foods at a local grocery store after my farming chores. This led to another person asking if I wanted to stock all the potato chips in the store as well. Obviously there were no child labor laws when I was young, and I wasn't complaining. <br /><br />I was able to scrape together enough money for a down payment to hold the skis, and then every two weeks, I walked to the mall and made a small payment on the skis. I would ask if I could see the skis, and the salesperson would bring them out from the storeroom. Oh, sweet reunion! After spending some quality time together, I would hand the skis back, wave longingly goodbye, and get back to work. It took a <em>year</em> to earn enough money to take those skis home. I have owned many pairs of skis in my lifetime. But there was only one pair that was never sold, given away, or sent to the local thrift store. It is this pair. <br /><br />I learned that the old-school pioneer law of the harvest really did work. It took much longer than I hoped, but in <em>due season</em> the reward did come. It was much harder than I expected, but I fainted not. Or, in other words, I didn't quit or stop, even though I had no idea when the harvest would actually come. <br /><br />I learned something else about the law of the harvest that I didn't quite bank on. Oh, I got the skis that I worked for, but I also received much, much more. For example, my mother and father were right. I did appreciate<em> </em>these skis more <em>because </em>I did buy them myself. I also harvested something of even greater and lasting value. I reaped a knowledge that I could find solutions to my challenges, that I could do difficult things, and that I could endure much better than I thought I could. I harvested experience, grit, and a determination that continues to bless me to this day. <br /><br />Those who "work with might for a cause that's right" will reap a harvest in spades. This is true of earning a degree, learning new skills, gaining a testimony, falling in love, and becoming converted to truth. President Uchtdorf testified that "God's harvest is unimaginably glorious. To those who honor Him, His bountiful blessings come in "good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over.... For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again (Luke 6:38)."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> <br /><br />I invite you to stand on the shoulders of your heritage, the scriptures, and other disciples, and <em>work</em> like there is no tomorrow. I promise that blessings will ensue--even beyond your expectations. So "Come, come, ye Saints! ... Why should we mourn or think our lot is hard? Tis not so; all is right. Why should we think to earn a great reward if we now shun the fight?" <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>2. You do have to have great courage</strong> &nbsp; <br />When Evan Stephens penned "While the enemy assaileth, shall we shrink or shun the fight?" in his hymn "True to the Faith," he answered with an emphatic "No!" It usually requires great courage to work with might for a cause that's right. More often than not, a demonstration of great courage will be required at the threshold of success--which typically comes when you least expect it. Of all the hundreds of papers, quizzes, and exams from my undergraduate degree, I am holding in my hand the only thing I saved from my <em>entire</em> undergraduate experience. This is a Chemistry 105 exam. I vividly remember watching the professor handing a big stack of exams to the person on the front row and saying, "Find your exam and pass the pile along." This was long before FERPA laws protecting privacy, so public humiliation or adoration (depending on how you performed) was always a looming possibility. I hastily retrieved my exam and hurried out of class. As I was walking out of the building, I quickly glanced at the exam and saw the number 76 scrawled across the top in red pen. "76?" I quickly stuffed the exam into my backpack. I felt as if someone had punched me in the stomach. My mind raced, and I started thinking that obviously I wasn't smart enough to be at a university, for surely everyone else in the class scored much higher than I did. I envisioned my fellow classmates celebrating together at the student center, toasting their success with chocolate milk. The number 76 kept flashing over and over in my mind as I walked toward my apartment by going down the stairs south of campus leading to a botanical pond. Nearing the bottom of the stairs, I pulled the dreaded exam from my backpack, hoping that I somehow read my score incorrectly. But sure enough, that red 76 was still there. But then I saw something I hadn't noticed before. My heart raced when I saw a tiny minus sign. You see, I didn't get a 76 on this exam; I <em>missed</em> 76! And sure enough, in the corner was the number 24. Surely this is the lowest score in school history given to someone who actually tried to do well. I was so stunned that my first impulse was to jump into the botanical pond, swim to the bottom, and hide from the entire world. Little did I know that botanical pond was less than three feet deep. So that plan would have also received a score of 24 as it too would have been doomed to failure. <br /><br />Now you may ask, "Why in the world did you save that particular exam as your only memento<em> </em>of your undergraduate academic experience?" It is because this experience impacted and shaped me in significant ways--ways I hope to always remember. I am not proud of failing (or failing with such absolute certainty). What happened next, however, was something that required pioneer-like<em> </em>courage. Somehow, I resisted the overwhelming urge to pack all my belongings into my car and drive home and leave school and all my humiliation in the rear-view mirror. It was during this time that I came across a quote that was attributed to Winston Churchill that read, "Success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup></a> I climbed up on Winston's shoulders and strained to see beyond this setback. But it took every bit of courage I had to get up, dust off my pride, place my ego in check, return to class, and get back to work. And because I couldn't muster that type of courage on my own, I climbed up on the shoulders of the pioneer Saints and listened to them invite me yet again to "Come, Come, ye Saints... Gird up your loins; fresh courage take. Our God will never us forsake; and soon we'll have this tale to tell-- All is well! All is well!" <br /><br />I occasionally look at this exam and remember that "failure is not fatal" and that it's the "courage to continue that counts." I remember that every storm will eventually break if you just hold on long enough. I remember that learning is a process and not an event and that I could do difficult things even when it takes more time, strength, effort, and courage than I think or feel I have. Most importantly, I am reminded that life is not determined by a singular performance, and there are times when you need to be courageous. So when your mettle is tested, please climb up on the shoulders of those who came before you so you can see further and know that it's "not so bad! Not so bad!" <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>3. Faith to Conquer Fear<br /></strong>We must have faith <em>to </em>conquer fear. Too many assume that it is faith<em> </em>that conquers fear. This implies that faith will do all the work while you sit on a couch, devouring a bag of Cheetos while binge-watching Netflix. On the contrary, in the <em>Lectures on Faith</em>, Joseph Smith described faith as "the moving cause to all action."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> You see, faith is not so much something that you merely possess as much as it is something that starts to possess you, causing <em>you</em> to act. No wonder James warned, "Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> Possessing faith but not doing something lacks all power. Faith would never cause a person to turn tail, hide, or disappear at the first sign of failure, self-doubt, challenge, or fear.</p>
<p>Your list of fears may include navigating the world of dating--or the world of <em>not</em> dating--exams, your major, or the future in general. Faith helps us to summon the courage and strength to take just one more step, which will be followed by another, and then another which will conquer our fears--small or large. When we draw upon this faith and act, we know that somehow--just somehow--it will all work out in the end. And if it doesn't work out, then this brand of faith assures us that this is not the end.</p>
<p>The key is living according to our faith. As you act on what you know to be right, to be loyal to your testimony, and do all that you can, I promise you that you will find power to conquer all fear. "And Christ hath said," wrote Moroni, "If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> Faith in Christ gives us the power to act as needed--regardless of our fears. <br /><br />Many years ago, our family planned to spend Christmas with my wife's family in Seattle. Because of my work schedule, I was not able to travel with my family but planned to join them a few days after they arrived. One night my wife's younger brother, who was in high school at the time, invited a group of friends to hang out. Unbeknownst to them, it started snowing, and soon all the roads were closed, leaving everyone stranded for the night at my in-laws' home. Trying to accommodate the group for the night meant that my wife ended up having a new roommate. They made small talk, eventually said goodnight, and turned out the light. As my wife was lying in bed, it dawned on her that she hadn't said her personal prayers before retiring. She didn't feel right saying her prayers as she lay in bed, but at the same time, she didn't feel comfortable getting out of bed and kneeling with a stranger in the room. She feared what this girl might think, especially if she didn't believe in God. She feared that maybe she might be considered a religious fanatic or some type of weirdo. She feared that somehow her new roommate might feel uncomfortable, be offended, or have a negative opinion of the Church. She even feared that she wasn't being true to her own conscience by not doing what she has done most every night of her life and pray kneeling by the side of her bed. What should she do? She decided to wait silently until her new roomie was asleep and then take action. <br /><br />Feeling certain that her roommate was indeed asleep, my wife carefully and silently slid out of bed, not wanting to wake her guest. She would have made the stealthiest ninja proud. She knelt by the side of her bed, offered her prayer, and then repeated the ninja-like return to bed. Mission accomplished. She had scarcely settled in when she heard a voice in the dark ask, "Lisa, were you just praying?" My wife answered, "Yes, I was." It was silent again for a moment, and then she heard, "All my life I've wanted to pray, but I just didn't know how." Another silent pause. "Will you teach me?" Lisa turned on the light, talked about a loving Heavenly Father, the power and process of prayer, and then they kneeled together, and a "first" prayer was offered. <br /><br />Lisa's faith drove her to action--to her knees--rather than to remain passive and overwhelmed with fears. I have been privileged to witness this woman of faith overcome her fears as she has acted on promptings, accepted callings that pushed her beyond her comfort, and courageously maintained her standards without dilution. She overcame the fears of what the future might hold--especially being married to me--as I worked through three university degrees, and full-time employment that was not in sight. Her first response to worry is to pray. Her first inclination when fear sets in is turn to God. I know saying this embarrasses her, and I will surely hear about this on our drive home today, but she is a fine example of what it means to have faith to conquer fear. <br /><br />So the next time you feel fear creeping in, whether about your future, failure, poor health, serving a mission, family shortcomings, getting married, remaining single, repenting, breaking habits, personal doubts, gender orientation, victimization, or whether or not the blessings promised in your patriarchal blessing will ever be fulfilled--please climb up on the shoulders of those who exhibit faith to conquer fear. The view is much, much better up here. Oh, "Come, come, ye Saints. No toil nor labor fear; but with joy wend your way. Though hard to you this journey may appear, grace shall be as your day." <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Conclusion<br /></strong>During a particularly trying time for Joseph Smith, when he could have been overwhelmed with discouragement, fear, and doubt, Jesus Christ revealed what we now call section six of the Doctrine and Covenants. In this section, Christ reveals that all disciples must have great courage (D&amp;C 6:13), embrace the law of the harvest (D&amp;C 6:33) and work with might for a cause that's right (D&amp;C 6:6). We also learn from this revelation that we must have faith to overcome all fear, as Christ said, "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not."<a href="/devotionals/matthew-o-richardson#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my favorite scriptural stories that illustrates the power of standing on the shoulder of giants is found in John 1:35-42. John the Baptist is standing with two of his disciples, or followers: John, son of Zebedee, and Andrew. Upon seeing Jesus Christ, John says, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" causing these two disciples to follow after Jesus (John 1:36). When Jesus noticed these two men following Him, He turned and asked, "What seek ye?" John and Andrew query, "Where dwellest thou?" Jesus replies, "Come and see" (John 1:39). The account states that they "abode with him [Jesus] that day." I like to think they climbed upon the Savior's shoulders and spent the day seeing farther than they had ever seen before. It forever changed them. They returned home and invited their brothers to come to "see" what they had seen that day. <br /><br />Upon meeting Andrew's brother, Simon Peter, Jesus immediately invited him up on His shoulders so he could see himself more clearly. "Thou art Simon the son of Jona," Jesus said upon meeting Peter for the first time. "Thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone" (John 1:42). Do you see what Jesus just did? He helped Peter see more in himself that he had ever seen before. "I will call you rock!" Have you ever considered how that statement made Peter feel about himself? Rock! Not pebble, not dirt clod. <em>Rock</em>. That has a rugged ring to it. I am certain Peter stood a little taller that day. And what about the nickname James and John received? They were known as the "sons of thunder" (Mark 3:17). How did that make them feel? Or what about their father, Thunder, himself? <br /><br />I testify that Jesus is the Christ. He sees more in you than you will ever see in yourself. So "come, come, ye Saints," and stand on His shoulders. It is my prayer that you will have great courage, faith to conquer fear, and work with might for a cause that's right. I promise that if you will make these characteristics your own, you will discern better and see farther in the future, giving you more confidence than you've yet experienced. I know these things to be true and that with Christ, "All is well! All is well!" In His name, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p>Anne Hendricks Papworth was born and raised in Rexburg, Idaho. After graduating from Ricks College, she served a mission in Oakland, California, and then completed a B.A. and M.A. at BYU, in Provo. She then worked as a professional writer and professor in upstate New York. In addition to her travels in the United States, she has been blessed to travel to 16 different countries. Proving that life loves irony, and despite all her travels, in 2000, Sister Papworth found herself back in her hometown of Rexburg, to teach in the English department. <br /><br />This decision has brought her both professional and personal happiness, as she met her husband, Jim, in this department. The day they married, Sister Papworth became a wife, a mother, and a grandmother. With her husband, seven sons, and soon-to-be 12 grandchildren, she has been blessed more than she ever imagined by that decision to return to Rexburg. &nbsp; <br /><br />Sister Papworth has served in the primary, Young Women's organization, Relief Society, and Sunday School. Currently, she works with the Beehives in her home ward, where she is learning to speak in emojis and exclamation points. The faith and enthusiasm of these young women inspire her to find joy in every day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a Ricks College student, I sat every Tuesday in the Hart Auditorium to listen to devotional. Most likely I was there because my friends were there, and that's what we did on Tuesday afternoons. Regardless of why I came, each Tuesday I spent that hour listening to doctrine, testimony, and music. I can't remember every speaker or every musical number, but I do remember feeling the Holy Spirit, which bore witness to me of Christ's divinity and my Heavenly Father's love. I pray that same Spirit will be here with us today.<br /><br /> Society considers <em>easy</em> one of the essential characteristics of life. In its commercials, one company claims shopping with them is like having an "easy" button. In fact, you can actually purchase an "easy" button that is linked to their website. Just push the button and order whatever you need when you need it. <br /><br />But in our desire to find the easy way, do we sometimes make things harder than they need to be? <br /><br />To illustrate, I'd like to share an experience I had with a Foundations English 101 class and their research paper. Because we were working on a long assignment, I'd broken the essay into several smaller (and hopefully easier) sections. The introduction was no problem for the students, and they felt comfortable with the summary that followed. But then we got to the hard part: the synthesis section. This wasn't something they had done before, and I knew that many students would struggle with this part of the assignment. But I wasn't too worried, because I had planned for this. First, we studied the concepts of synthesis. Then we looked at and analyzed writing samples, studying how others had completed this assignment. But eventually it was time for the students to try it themselves. <br /><br />That day's homework was to come to class with a draft of the synthesis section so we could workshop their essays and identify where they were still struggling. However, the morning this draft was due, a massive outbreak struck campus. At least, that was my thought as I walked into a room with about half of my students missing. It wasn't a flu epidemic that had kept students out of class that day, but an epidemic of a different type. Throughout the day I received emails from absent students who explained that they'd tried to write this section, couldn't figure it out, quit trying, and, because their homework wasn't done, decided to skip class. <br /><br />Now, the students who did come to class hadn't completed the assignment perfectly, but they came, having done what they could on their own. And because they did, they had a foundation to work from as we looked at their questions and addressed their confusion. As they walked out of class, these students were laughing and joking with each other, very different emotions from the frustration they'd expressed at the beginning of class. Many sighed with relief and expressed appreciation: "Thanks. Today's class answered so many of my questions."&nbsp; <br /><br />The students who skipped class that day because "the assignment was just so hard" were now even more behind. They still didn't have a draft, and now they didn't have the additional information and feedback to help them work through this difficult section. <br /><br />This experience reminds me of the parable of the ten virgins. As a child, I struggled with this story. I'd been to Primary. I'd attended elementary school. My parents raised me right. I knew that you were supposed to share with others. So why couldn't the five wise women simply share their oil with the five foolish women? <br /><br />As I grew older, attended seminary, and learned more about this parable, I came to understand why sharing wasn't an option. Elder Marvin J. Ashton taught, "The wise virgins could not share their oil with the foolish virgins because 'the oil of spiritual preparedness cannot be shared.'"<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> <br /><br />We cannot share our oil because of how we fill our lamps. President Spencer W. Kimball explains, "Attendance at&nbsp;sacrament&nbsp;meetings adds oil to our lamps, drop by drop over the years. Fasting,&nbsp;family&nbsp;prayer, home teaching, control of bodily appetites, preaching the gospel, studying the scriptures--each act of dedication and obedience is a drop added to our store. Deeds of kindness, payment of offerings and tithes, chaste thoughts and actions, marriage in the covenant for eternity--these, too, contribute importantly to the oil with which we can, at midnight, refuel our exhausted lamps."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> I can't help but think this principle applies to education as well. We are better off filling the lamps of our learning drop by drop--one chapter or lesson at a time--rather than trying to read an entire book or write an entire term paper overnight. It reminds me of the joke when a student comes to the teacher and says, "Uh, I know I haven't done anything all semester, but what can I do in the next five minutes to bring my grade up?" <br /><br />Like the student in this joke, even though it wasn't possible, the foolish virgins who didn't bring extra oil scrambled to find some at the last minute. Similarly, my students who skipped class that day tried to fill their lamps as best they could. In their emails to me, they asked every instructor's favorite questions: "Did I miss anything important?" and "Can you tell me what I missed?" But just as the foolish virgins couldn't fill their lamps last minute, it was impossible for these students to make up 90 minutes of discussion and learning in an email. <br /><br />This example with my class also illustrates a fairly understandable response to "hard." Some students felt the assignment was too hard and quit. I also struggle against the impulse to quit, trying to avoid difficulties when they occur. <br /><br />But I need to learn how to face difficulties, because hardship is part of life. Have you ever heard the phrase "I can do hard things"? My son Tavenor repeatedly heard this motto in his first swimming class, as he struggled with rainbow arms and ice-cream-scoop hands and when he worried about putting his face in the water. We hear this statement from the time we are small because parents, coaches, and teachers know we will be asked to do hard things throughout our lives. <br /><br />And doing hard things is ... well, hard. And it can be painful. To quote the Dread Pirate Roberts from <em>The Princess Bride</em>, "Life is pain. Anyone who says differently is selling something."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> <br /><br />Leaving behind motivational clich&eacute;s and humorous movie quotes, the scriptures teach us why there is hardship and pain in this world. In the Book of Mormon, Lehi teaches Jacob, "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> <br /><br />I love that Lehi offers this counsel to Jacob, of all his children. Second Nephi, chapter two, verse two, explains why Jacob might have needed this reminder that opposition is a natural consequence of the world: "Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain." <br /><br />Jacob, firstborn in the wilderness, had a life of afflictions. He never knew the ease of city life, where you could run to the store for groceries rather than hunting for your food. He never knew what it was like to live in a house with walls and a roof. Instead, Jacob "dwelt in a tent."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> The scriptures say he even suffered because some of his family members had lost their faith. Despite these hardships, Jacob is reminded, "Thou knowest the greatness of God." Jacob's challenges and hardships in the wilderness did not mean God had abandoned him. <br /><br />It makes sense that Lehi would speak to his children about the value of doing hard things. They were asked to do unimaginable things. Some of his children accepted these hard tasks with determination. Nephi's response is legendary: "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> Sam, Jacob, and Joseph responded likewise. But Laman and Lemuel wanted the "easy button." They didn't want hard: "They did murmur in many things against their father, because he was a visionary man, and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in the wilderness."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> Laman and Lemuel did not understand why they were doing these hard things. Because God had asked it of them. They thought their visionary father was just making their lives difficult "because of the foolish imaginations of his heart."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> <br /><br />Yet the Lord has repeatedly taught us why we <em>must</em> do hard things. His Apostle Elder Dallin H. Oaks reminds us that "the purpose of mortal life ... is to provide the experiences needed 'to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize [our] divine destiny as heirs of eternal life.'"<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> <br /><br />So how do we progress? How do we fulfill our divine destiny? Elder Oaks answers these questions as he reminds us, "We progress by making choices, by which we are tested to show that we will keep God's commandments. To be tested, we must have the agency to choose between alternatives. To provide alternatives on which to exercise our agency, we must have opposition."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> Let me repeat that. To progress, we must have opposition. Therefore, we will face difficulties and hardships. <br /><br />Although we need to recognize that hardship is part of life, we must also remember it is not the Lord's goal for our lives. Again, Lehi explains this distinction. Consider 2 Nephi, chapter two, which lists some of the sorrows we might face in life: opposition, challenges to our agency, captivity of the spirit through sin, and the power of the devil tempting us. But in the midst of all this chapter's list of hardships, Lehi reminds Jacob and us, "Men are, that they might have joy."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> <br /><br />Speaking of this principle, Elder Richard G. Scott teaches, "Sadness, disappointment, and severe challenge are events in life, not life itself. I do not minimize how hard some of these events are. They can extend over a long period of time, but they should not be allowed to become the confining center of everything you do. The Lord inspired Lehi to declare the fundamental truth, 'Men are, that they might have joy.'"<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> Elder Scott then cautions us that, although the Lord intends for us to have joy, our joy is conditional upon ourselves.<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> It depends on whether we seek the easy way through life--what we might call the Laman-and-Lemuel approach to life--or if we face opposition the way the Lord asks us to, with faith and determination, as Nephi and Jacob did. Fortunately, as we face opposition the Lord's way, we will not be facing it alone. Our loving Heavenly Father has given us tools to face opposition and to find joy. <br /><br />One of the primary tools Heavenly Father has given us is faith. Elder Scott proclaims that "your joy in life depends upon your trust in Heavenly Father and His holy Son, your conviction that their plan of happiness truly can bring you joy."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> <br /><br />How can faith in Heavenly Father and His holy Son help us overcome hard things and find joy? First, it is faith that encourages us just to try hard things. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf explains, "Faith is a strong conviction about something we believe--a conviction so strong that it moves us to do things that we otherwise might not do."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> <br /><br />As a young girl, I was horribly shy. For example, when I was 11 years old, my ward's Relief Society held a fashion show to spotlight the clothes made by the many talented women in our ward. Because my talented mother had made me a beautiful Sunday dress, she thought it might be fun for me to participate. At least, that's how she sold the idea to me. I'm sure she was just trying to get me to be brave and break free from my shyness. At first, it sounded OK, particularly when, to sweeten the deal, Mom offered to buy me my very first pair of nylons to wear with my dress. But that night, while all the other models lined up to walk the runway, I hid in the bathroom. And I hid there all evening. I just couldn't bring myself to walk out on that stage, even in front of neighbors and friends. <br /><br />How did I get from a "hide in the bathroom" girl to a missionary who made it a goal to speak to every person she could? It was faith; because as President Uchtdorf said, faith is "so strong that it moves us to do things that we otherwise might not do."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> <br /><br />A few years after this failed fashion show, I received my patriarchal blessing, which stated, "You will have the opportunity to serve a proselyting mission." Although this scared me, I had faith that my patriarchal blessing came from Heavenly Father, who loved me and wanted the best for me. So I had faith that I would be ready when the time came to serve that mission. <br /><br />Obviously, I had to do my part. I couldn't hide out in bathrooms for six years and then magically be able to speak to everyone when I was a missionary. Drop by drop, I had to fill my lamp of preparedness. I had to take advantage of the opportunities my parents helped me find, and I had to look for my own opportunities to speak out. I had to say yes when I had the chance to spend my junior year in Washington, DC. I had to say yes that same year, when my history teacher asked me, the only Mormon in my class, to do a presentation on Mormon pioneers and their westward trek. I had to say yes when I was called to be Gospel Doctrine teacher my first semester at Ricks College, teaching the Doctrine and Covenants<em> </em>to what seemed like a room full of know-it-all returned missionaries. <br /><br />At the time, these opportunities didn't seem like opportunities. They felt like hardships. But I had faith that these opportunities were from the Lord, and I had faith that He would help me. <br /><br />As we have faith in our Father in Heaven, we can have faith in ourselves. We are His children, and He will guide us through difficulties. President Uchtdorf explains, "The purpose of faith is not to <em>change</em> God's will but to empower us to <em>act on</em> God's will. Faith is trust--trust that God sees what we cannot and that He knows what we do not."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> <br /><br />For some of you here today, completing the semester's coursework might seem impossible, or at least incredibly hard. But you are here at BYU-Idaho because you have faith that you can and will learn. You have faith that you will master the concepts you seek to master. Remember that faith when you are tempted to skip class or to skip homework. Don't forget that faith as the semester progresses and tests and concepts get harder. <br /><br />Remember that your Heavenly Father knows what you do not. This doesn't mean that He'll give you the answers during an exam. You have to do your part. But He knows what you are capable of learning. Ask Him for guidance as you study. Ask Him for patience and long-suffering as you study, particularly when you have a lot of homework and you'd rather be hanging out with your friends. The Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, verse 118, makes this connection between learning and faith: "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith." <br /><br />Faith is a tool to help us through our hardships, but in times of difficulty our faith can weaken. Some may even begin to doubt Heavenly Father's love, asking, "How can a loving Father in Heaven allow this suffering?" <br /><br />If this happens, remember that Satan uses doubt and anger to counteract the power of faith. Nephi warned that Satan will "rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> If we question Heavenly Father in anger, we limit our access to the Holy Ghost, and we weaken our faith. <br /><br />At a time when I was in the middle of a great trial, my mother tried to comfort me with the statement "at least you know that you are a child of God." She was trying to remind me that, as a child of God, I should have faith in His plans for me and faith that I could get through this difficulty. My response, "Well, how does that help me right now?" was a response that stemmed from anger and bitterness, not faith. I felt that if I were a child of God, then He should take this adversity from me. And I was angry because He hadn't made the trial go away. So, at this point in my struggles, I felt that knowing I was a child of God wasn't much help. <br /><br />Although we should resist anger, having faith doesn't mean that we have to be at perfect peace in our trials. Even though we feel pain, we can use our faith in Heavenly Father to cope with that pain and to endure it. As I let go of my anger and leaned on my faith, I then changed my angry question to a faith-based question. No longer did I wonder, "How does knowing I'm a child of God prevent me from having pain?" but instead I learned to ask, "How does knowing that I'm a child of God help me heal from this pain?" This question directed me to the tools Heavenly Father had prepared for me: prayer, scripture study, temple attendance, a loving family, and many others who blessed my life at this time. <br /><br />If we face trials with faith, we are better able to see the blessings the Lord provides us to succeed in these hardships. It might be tempting to think that the times we are blessed are the easy times when we have little adversity. Instead, we need to recognize that true blessings come at the time of hardship, at the time we need the Lord's help. For example, a few years ago, my husband and I, along with two of our sons and two of their friends, were driving home from Island Park, where we'd had a fun weekend camping. On the way home, a driver coming the opposite direction drifted across the highway and hit us. While we were not injured, our truck was damaged, and the trailer we were pulling was obliterated. The young man in the other car nearly lost his leg, requiring many surgeries and months of rehab. <br /><br />It might be difficult to see the blessings in this hardship, but there were many. First, before the accident, we weren't entirely focused on the highway. Four loud and enthusiastic boys in the backseat can be a bit distracting. But in the seconds before that car drifted towards us, the truck became calm. For no apparent reason, we all stopped talking and focused on the road ahead. This quiet allowed my husband, Jim, to react quickly and swerve to avoid a head-on collision, which would have led to even greater injury and possibly death. <br /><br />Additionally, this accident occurred at one of the few turnouts on this highway. We had plenty of room to swerve without worrying about sliding off the road. This pull out also provided room for Jim and another driver, who'd stopped to help, to assist the young man in the other car. They were able to apply a tourniquet that reduced the bleeding and saved his life. It also provided room for the ambulance, police officers, and many others to work, as they used the Jaws of Life to remove the young man from the car. Finally, this man's severe injuries came from the impact of hitting our trailer, but, miraculously, the trailer was empty. Just minutes before we left the campsite, we decided not to haul home our four-wheelers, leaving them for the others who were staying behind. Had his car hit a loaded trailer, this young man would have died instantly. <br /><br />Yes, this young man had great difficulty ahead of him. But the very details of this accident reflected the blessings that we all received that night. <br /><br />Faith and suffering can and do co-exist. Joseph Smith's pleas in Liberty Jail show this. He agonized, "O God, where art thou?"<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> Yet his question was not one of doubt. It was a plea for comfort. His faith was strong even though he suffered, and he soon gained the comfort that he sought: "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> <br /><br />Through faith, we can trust the promise of the psalm: "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> <br /><br />While faith in a general sense will help us endure trials, faith in Jesus Christ will be our greatest tool in facing adversity and finding joy. Let me return to my original premise: despite the trials we face, we are that we might have joy. The Savior's mission on earth is essential to this joy. In fact, when the angel announced the Savior's birth, he proclaimed, "Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> <br /><br />As we consider how faith in Jesus Christ helps us through trials, we might first think of repentance. Sometimes we create our own trials: we make poor choices; we fail to keep commandments; we mess up because we aren't perfect. And we're not expected to be perfect. But when we sin, this sin causes us pain. <br /><br />Alma describes the intense pain he felt as he came to recognize his sins, declaring, "I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> Fortunately, we do not have to be trapped in this pain, and Alma teaches us how as he continues:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death. &nbsp; <br /><br />And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more. &nbsp; <br /><br />And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a></p>
<p>I love the promise given in these verses. We can be freed from the pain of sin, and we can be filled with the joy and marvelous light of being made clean. <br /><br />While the scriptures testify of the joy that comes through repentance, we should also remember that the Atonement extends beyond repentance. The Savior teaches us this key principle when He promises, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> <br /><br />One semester I had a student who needed the rest the Savior offers. She came to my office one evening in tears. Although her original purpose in coming was somehow related to our class, she soon started talking about her burdens. She had been married for almost two years and had a beautiful nine-month-old son. But her husband had a pornography addiction. <br /><br />At first he had been apologetic and repentant, but as their marriage continued, he had now become defensive and angry. He didn't see why his behavior mattered to anyone else but him. After all, he hadn't changed. He was the same man, the same husband, the same father. But this wasn't true. Sin changes us, even if we won't admit it. Caught up in his sin, he didn't realize or didn't care that he'd started demeaning his wife, verbally abusing her for her efforts in their home, with their son, and in their marriage. And lately he'd become impatient with their child.&nbsp; <br /><br />She wasn't really coming to me for advice; she just needed someone to listen. But as she finished, I couldn't help but make some suggestions. I recommended that she work with her bishop and a therapist to help her with the decisions she faced and to ensure her safety. I then offered comfort by reminding her that the Atonement could help ease her pain. She looked at me with great surprise and shock. <br /><br />"No, Sister Papworth," she said. "I'm not the one with the pornography addiction. It's my husband that needs repentance." <br /><br />This lovely, faithful young woman didn't understand that the Atonement means more than repentance. She didn't need to carry the burden of her pain and sorrow alone. Sister Linda K. Burton, Relief Society general president, explains that "our Heavenly Father ... [loves] us enough that He sent His Only Begotten and perfect Son to suffer for our sins, [but also for] our heartaches, and all that seems unfair in our own individual lives."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a> <br /><br />Like this young woman, we will suffer pain for reasons that are not our fault. Like this young woman, we might suffer pain because of others' choices. We might face physical or mental illness. We might face disappointment and anxiety. But, like this young woman, we can turn to our Savior, and He will bring us peace. As Elder Oaks has stated, "His Atonement reaches and is powerful enough not only to pay the price for sin but also to heal every mortal affliction."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a> <br /><br />This comfort might not be immediate. Spiritual and emotional healing isn't as easy as pushing an "easy" button. And often the healing power of the Atonement comes drop by drop, until it becomes a healing balm that can soothe our wounds. But the Savior has promised that, because of Him, our pain and suffering can end. Although it may feel eternal, our hardship will be "but a small moment."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a> <br /><br />Because we live in a world of opposition, we will struggle with adversity. But as we struggle to face hardship or to understand what we seemingly cannot understand, let us remember that the atoning sacrifice of the Savior can comfort and heal. The Lord has promised, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy."<a href="/devotionals/anne-papworth#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a> While we seek to overcome opposition, we should also seek to strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ, for that testimony, and His grace, can sustain us until we do. I bear testimony of this truth in His name. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Talks:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is an honor for me and my sweetheart, June, to be here with you. You represent a powerful force for good. I wonder what the future holds for each of you and how you will respond to the inevitable challenges of life. Nearly 37 years ago, Sister Pearson and I were married. There is simply no way we could have anticipated the challenges and adversity life would bring. The best decision I ever made was to marry a woman of great faith. She has been a tower of spiritual strength in my life. Our children reflect her faithfulness and commitment to truth and light. If her life could be summed up in one phrase, it might well be "Choose you this day whom ye will serve; ... but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a><br /><br /> I humbly invite the Spirit to be with us as we consider together one of the fundamental realities of mortality: our divine duty to seek light and truth. Each soul is accountable to God for the light and truth available in her or his time on earth. This responsibility is inescapable. "God judges men according to the use they make of this light which He gives them."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> <br /><br />All of us entered mortality with every intention to embrace light and truth. No one came to do otherwise. Your personal responsibility is heightened by attending this university and the sacred covenants with God made at baptism and in the holy temple. <br /><br />Some time ago, while speaking in a stake conference, I noticed a cute little girl sitting on the third row right in front of me. She had what appeared to be a small handmade telescope. I thought it might be a kaleidoscope, and she was just using the light behind me. I wondered what she could see. Suddenly our eyes met. Unfortunately, her mother realized what was happening and took the little telescope away. My little friend quickly slid under her seat and never returned. I was left wondering what lens she was looking through. <br /><br />As I stood there at the pulpit, I concluded that everyone was looking at me through a different lens: some through the lens of struggle and unfulfilled expectations; others, through the lens of doubt and disbelief. Still others seemed to be anticipating with faith and hope my message. A number were indifferently focused on their cell phones. &nbsp; <br /><br />I share this story for two reasons. First, to assure you that men really can do more than one thing at the same time! Second, to raise a question: What lens are you looking through?&nbsp; <br /><br />Consider this: When you look in a mirror, whom do you see? Do you focus on the physical image in the mirror, or do you look a little deeper for the real you?&nbsp;To see ourselves the way God sees us might require us to take a fresh view through a different lens. If you and I could see ourselves as we really are and as we really can become, it would change our reality and our destiny through the choices we make and the things we value. That is the power of looking through the right lens. <br /><br />Recent research on millennials suggests that the average young single adult spends nearly nine hours a day online, immersed in music, games, virtual entertainment, and otherwise living life through social media. Wow! Media is a powerful lens. It changes the way we all see and understand the world. However, it is not the right lens to find and understand the truth about your divine destiny and purpose. <br /><br />Truth is not a function of personal preferences, perspectives, or desires. Truth is knowledge of things as they really are, not as we want them to be. As such, truth is rarely popular; it can even at times feel hard, unbending, and uncompromising. Truth withstands the test of time and eternity. Thus, it frees us from the consequences of error. <br /><br />Consider how a lens works. A lens requires light. The human eye is regarded as one of the most complex organs in our bodies. The human eye, however, has only one lens. To see, we require light and a healthy, functioning lens. Some of us require corrective lenses because our natural lenses have hardened, are misshapen, or are even diseased to some extent. We need the aid of specialized lenses to see great distances or observe microscopic detail. <br /><br />Like physical sight, spiritual sight requires light. Jesus Christ is the true source of light.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><br />He is in the sun, and the light of the sun, and the power thereof by which it was made.... <br /><br />And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same&nbsp;<br />light that quickeneth your understandings."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a></p>
<p><br />Joseph Smith and Sydney Rigdon described their experience receiving answers to inspired questions regarding the Bible this way: "By the power of the Spirit our eyes were opened and our understandings were enlightened, so as to see and understand the things of God."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""></a>Each of us is endowed with the Light of Christ: the ability to discern spiritual light and truth. Our spiritual eyes, however, have two lenses. "Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> Heavenly Father sends divine light into our minds and hearts. Through these lenses, principles of truth are transformed into understanding, knowledge, and conviction. &nbsp; <br /><br />This is a critical time of life for establishing patterns. You will make some of the most pivotal decisions of your life during these years. These patterns and decisions will prepare you for other critical phases of life. Struggle and hardship are inevitable and indispensable to mortality. In the end, we are the masters of our own fate and soul. What we become will be the cumulative sum of the consequences of the choices we make. We will get exactly what we choose. <br /><br />Ultimately, we will either choose to look through the lens of truth with faith to overcome life's challenges and to understand the issues of our time, or we will choose a secular lens to filter truth and to rationalize life's questions. The lens you choose will determine your destiny. <br /><br />Lehi's family also lived in difficult and distressing times. The family encountered extraordinary challenges, physical hardships, and deprivation of every kind, including the complete destruction of their people. However, Nephi consistently chose to look through the lens of faith. He was willing to study, ponder, and ask in faith. "I, Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> Notwithstanding constant opposition and persecution over many years from Laman and Lemuel, Nephi remained steadfast and immovable. "O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> Nephi's response defines looking through the lens of truth. <br /><br />By contrast, Laman and Lemuel complained, disputed, and opposed Lehi and Nephi at nearly every turn. They were unwilling to study, ponder, and ask in faith. "For he [Lehi] truly spake many great things unto them, which were hard to be understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord; and they being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they ought."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> Nephi would repeatedly remind them to reconsider: "Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?--If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> The lens we choose determines our perspective and our destiny. <br /><br />Why are truth and light so difficult to discover and discern? What prevented the Jews from recognizing Christ, the very source of truth and light? Surely, each of us would have recognized and embraced Him! What deters us from recognizing and embracing Him now in the fulness of times? <br /><br />Some of Satan's most effective weapons are distraction, deception, and desensitization. Each erodes faith, obscures vision, and skews perspective. Together they constitute the great challenge of our time. <br /><br />Distraction is the opposite of focus. You can't see what you're not looking for. Not all distractions are bad. But if they effectively prevent us from finding, understanding, and embracing truth, they are harmful and ultimately destructive. The Lord warns about the consequence of distraction: "Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and [they] aspire to the honors of men," they are not chosen.<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> Distractions can be fatally deceptive. <br /><br />Deception is the enemy of truth. It sows doubt and disbelief. It breeds pride and enmity. It hardens hearts and destroys faith. "For there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and denominations, [including our Church], who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men ... and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> With unparalleled access to information and information technology in the fulness of times, surely anyone can find the truth! The mission of the Holy Ghost is to testify of truth. That is the only way to find it, in any dispensation. Possession of the gift of the Holy Ghost, however, does not ensure access to its power and influence. Without it, we are all exposed to distraction and deception. Think about your personal prayers. How often do you pray for the influence and companionship of the Holy Ghost? Remember, you get what you focus on consistently. <br /><br />Spiritual desensitization is one of the great diseases of every dispensation. Think of the influences in your life that are spiritually offensive. These influences harden our hearts and dull our spiritual senses. Spirituality is defined as the level of personal righteousness that enables the near constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. We are promised the Holy Ghost will never allow us to make a serious mistake without first warning us.&nbsp;If we allow our hearts to harden, we become unwilling and unable to recognize spiritual promptings and warnings. <br /><br />You simply cannot spend the better part of every day focused on video games, online entertainment, and offensive music, and expect to have the Holy Ghost on demand. Nor can you expect to find truth and the answers to life's most important questions in a podcast, personal blog, or YouTube video produced by someone looking through the lens of doubt and disbelief! &nbsp; <br /><br />The Book of Mormon is critical in this process. It was written for our day. It is not a history book; it is a prologue for our time. Have you ever wondered why there are so many chapters on war? Why so many periods of societal, governmental, and economic uncertainty? The Savior directed the inclusion of exactly what we would need to survive the distraction, deception, and desensitization of our days. <br /><br />Maybe Father Lehi was actually talking to us when he taught about agents and objects:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your profit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be acted upon.... <br /><br />... And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon.<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a></p>
<p>Faith is a principle of action and power. When you choose to exercise faith and look through the lens of eternal truth by the power of the Holy Ghost, you are an agent. An agent seeks knowledge, understanding, and truth. An agent seeks learning by study and by faith. An agent is proactive, accountable, actively engaged. An agent understands that happiness is a choice and that they have a divine destiny and purpose. An agent seeks to understand the world through the lens of the plan of salvation and trusts in Heavenly Father, and in the Savior and His Atonement. <br /><br />President Ezra Taft Benson taught that obedience is the first and great law of heaven.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The great test of life</em> is obedience to God.... <em><br /></em><em></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The great task of life</em> is to learn the will of the Lord and then do it.<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> </p>
<p>The great task of life requires us to be agents and not objects. Are you an agent or an object? <br /><br />Several years ago, I met a friend for lunch. We hadn't seen each other for many years. During my high-school and early-college days, he had been one of my closest friends. We did everything together. We knew each other very well. He was one of the strongest and most committed young men I knew. We attended seminary together, played sports together, and prepared for missions together. We attended the University of Utah, and we left for missions a few months apart. He married a very talented and wonderful woman from my stake. <br /><br />As the years passed, our lives took different courses. We moved to different cities. But, as is often the case, we eventually lost touch with one another (this was before Facebook). I still remember how stunned I was to hear that he and his wife had left the Church. Of all those I knew in my youth, he was the very last one I would ever have thought would leave the Church. But there we were, sitting in a small caf&eacute; having lunch. <br /><br />We reminisced over the friendship that had meant so much to both of us. We laughed again at some of the crazy experiences of earlier days. We talked about our families and tried to close the gap of time. Finally, I asked the obvious question: "Tim," I said, "what happened? You were so deeply converted and committed! Why did you leave the Church? What caused you to walk away from your temple covenants? Have you also left the Savior? We promised one another that we would be true and faithful to the end of our lives! What happened?" <br /><br />"Kevin," he replied, "I simply see things differently now. My view of the Church and its teachings has changed. I don't hate the Church--I just don't need it anymore." <br /><br />As we concluded our visit, I expressed my love and gratitude for a friendship I still value. Then, with deep feeling, I expressed my testimony. "Tim, I know these things are true. And you know they're true too. You have always known. You've simply lost the clarity you once had. But you can regain the light and understanding of the Holy Ghost you once had again. Please come back." As we embraced, he whispered, "I admire your conviction and passion. But how can you be so sure?" As I walked away, I reflected deeply on the impact of the choices we had made on our own lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren. <br /><br />My young friends, please don't let what happened to my friend Tim happen to you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Are you as steadfast, immovable, and converted as you think you are? When you encounter the inevitable and necessary challenges of life, where will you turn for peace and understanding? When your life gets dark and dreary, will you still instinctively and consistently think to pray? As criticism of the Church, its history, its leaders, and its teachings increases, where will you stand? As the beliefs and practices of an ever- darkening world collide with the principles of the restored gospel, what will you do? <br /><br />Remember the purpose of distraction, deception, and desensitization is not simply to undermine Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, Church doctrine, and its leaders--it is to attack the Savior and the Father's plan. It has always been so. When the inevitable fury of temptations and tribulations approach category-five spiritual storm conditions, will you still trust God and cling to truth? The penetrating question of the Savior unto the Twelve is still in force today:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Will ye also go away? <br /><br />Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. <br /><br />And we believe and are sure that thou are that Christ, the Son of the living God.<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a></p>
<p>I am reminded of a powerful statement by Heber C. Kimball. The Saints had safely arrived in the Salt Lake Valley and were quite pleased with themselves. Having overcome and endured so much, they were a bit prideful and overconfident. He stated,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Let me say to you, that many of you will see the time when you will have all the trouble, trial and persecution that you can stand, and plenty of opportunities to show that you are true to God and his work.... To meet the difficulties that are coming, it will be necessary for you to have a knowledge of the truth of this work for yourselves.... If you have not got the testimony, live right and call upon the Lord and cease not till you obtain it. If you do not, you will not stand.... The time will come when no man nor woman will be able to endure on borrowed light. Each will have to be guided by the light within himself. If you do not have it, how can you stand?<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a></p>
<p>I wish it were not true, but these are our days. We live in tumultuous times. But the question is not how the Church will fare--rather how you and I will. "The Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand [will] stop the work from progressing."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> Whether you and I progress with it is the only unknown. <br /><br />May I suggest six essential things each of us must do to survive spiritually.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Love and obey God first</span>. Loving and obeying God necessarily precedes loving and serving others. Sequence is important. Attempting to love others while disregarding God eventually leads to apostasy. Nephi taught, "For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> Heavenly Father loves us and is always willing to give us understanding. We must, however, put Him first in our lives. <br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal prayer is essential</span>. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, "The best way to obtain truth and wisdom is not to ask from books [he might have added blogs too], but to go to God in prayer and obtain divine teaching."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> You will never be unworthy to pray! If you want more answers, ask more questions. Constantly seek for and pray for the influence of the Holy Ghost. "And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> This is the light the Father sends that brings understanding. <br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seek learning by study and by faith</span>. Learning is a divine duty. Agents seek learning. Objects wait to be acted upon. Great leaders are great learners. The Church needs great leaders--women and men seeking greater light and knowledge, deeper understanding and conversion. The glory of God is intelligence! This requires commitment and dedication. You cannot find truth scrolling a wiki or searching the blogosphere. Remember, faith is kindled by hearing the testimony of those who have faith, not those who have lost it. Be patient. The answers and understanding don't come all at once. Don't let something you don't fully understand yet unravel everything else you do know and understand. <br /><br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, every day, every day, every day</span>! The Book of Mormon was expressly written to protect and preserve us as we navigate the conditions of our day. Regarding its power, Nephi testified, "And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> If you start to feel confused and lost, start again on page one, and immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon. Clarity, perspective, understanding, and peace will return. It is the lens of truth. <br /><br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus on the big picture</span>. You are part of the greatest movement on Planet Earth: the gathering of Israel and preparation for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. You have an important role to play! You have always been faithful. You came committed to being valiant in your testimony of the Savior. That is your divine identity. Don't get lost in the tall grass of small things. Focus on the big picture. The big picture is Heavenly Father's plan of happiness. It is the lens of truth. It is the context for all questions, issues, and concerns. "For the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> <br /><br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Above all else, trust in Jesus Christ</span>. "[He is] the Christ, the Son of the living God."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> "[He is still] the light and the life of the world . . ."<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> When you are encompassed and overwhelmed by doubt, difficulty, and temptation, trust Him. When life isn't what you expected and those you trusted disappoint and betray you, continue to trust in Him completely. May you respond as Nephi of old in equally distressing times:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.... <br /><br />O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever.<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a></p>
<p>Whatever you do, do not leave the Savior! Stay by the Tree!<a href="/devotionals/elder-kevin-w-pearson#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> <br /><br />My dear young friends, you are indeed the master of your fate and soul. Because of the Savior's Atonement, we are agents, free to act and not to be acted upon. Each of us will stand before Almighty God and account for the light and truth we have chosen. <br /><br />I promise you that if you will follow these principles and cling to truth, your faith will never fail. May God bless you to always choose to look through the lens of truth by the power of the Holy Ghost, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>In November, just a few days before Thanksgiving, I sat with my ailing mother. I shared with her that I had been asked to speak at a BYU-Idaho Devotional and said, "Mom, it would be great if you could come." She said, "I don't think I will be able to make it," but assured me that she knew I would do a good job. My mother passed away on&nbsp;Christmas Eve. Today I feel as if she did make it here with me. &nbsp; At the young age of 16, I found myself searching for what I should do with my life and asking the Lord if what I had been taught was true.</p>
<p>I remember one day finding myself along the Snake River in Idaho Falls, sitting on a rock, asking my Father in Heaven if the Church was true. I did not get an answer then, but it has come over the years as I have documented the things I have experienced and felt in my life, things that have helped me build my testimony. &nbsp; <br /><br />I was grateful that my seminary teacher during that time was a dear friend to me. He was even my home teaching companion during my high-school years. He would take me to play racquetball and share his testimony with me, which helped influence my life and helped me find the direction I wanted to go. &nbsp; <br /><br />In 1999 I was looking to change my career. I was working for a company and was in a management position. I managed several groups under a working contract that required negotiations of their work environment. Sometimes the process of negotiating was very uncomfortable for me. The tension was very high between the groups, and I felt as if we were at war, with a battle line drawn. With threats sometimes being made, it made for some very challenging times in my job. &nbsp; <br /><br />One day, after one of those intense meetings, I was traveling home from work to have lunch with my wife. All of a sudden, my car window got shot out. Not knowing where it had come from, or from whom, I was pretty rattled. I decided right then I was going to make a change in my life with regards to my employment and career. I began to search for other opportunities and thought, "You know, Ricks College would be a great environment and a great place to work." &nbsp; <br /><br />On March 1, I completed 18 years of working on this campus. When I started working at Ricks College, my oldest daughter had just completed her degree. I have been blessed to have all five of my children here on this campus. They have all graduated from Ricks College or BYU-Idaho and are here with me today. &nbsp; <br /><br />What a great place to be! &nbsp; <br /><br />In these last 18 years, I have witnessed many miracles take place in the development of these beautiful facilities here on this campus. It is a blessing to me to have been asked to speak with you today, here in this wonderful BYU-Idaho Center, where I watched the first shovel of dirt removed to the last thing completed. I have seen things happen, I have listened to things that have been spoken, and I have documented them as part of my testimony. &nbsp; <br /><br />About 25 years ago, a good friend of mine from Logan, Utah, and I were going on a business trip to Washington, DC where he left a big impact on me. &nbsp; <br /><br />We had just boarded a large L-1011 airplane. It holds almost 300 passengers, and it was a full flight. My wife and I were seated on one side of the plane, and my good friend and his wife were on the opposite side. &nbsp; <br /><br />Just before we took off, with seat belts on, my friend stood up and with a loud voice said, "Bishop Watson. Hey, Bishop Watson!" &nbsp; <br /><br />All I could think of then was, "What is my friend planning to do? Then he said, in that same loud voice, "Have we told you we love you today?" &nbsp; <br /><br />I replied no. &nbsp; <br /><br />Then he said, "We love you!" &nbsp; <br /><br />If you could have seen the look on most of the passengers' faces, it was one of those priceless moments. I could see their look because they were all looking at me. &nbsp; <br /><br />Just about the way I feel right now. &nbsp; <br />I documented what I felt in my heart that day. My friend was not afraid to act upon what he felt and what he had been taught to do in his life. &nbsp; <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, have we told you we love you today? We love you! &nbsp; <br /><br />On September 26, 1923, a young 23-year-old aerial photographer in the United States Army was in flight over the Island of Oahu, Hawaii. He documented this picture of what the Hawaii temple looked like in 1923, just four years after the temple was completed. &nbsp; <br /><br />He also documented in his journal personal thoughts while serving as a young 23-year-old in the army in Hawaii. This was his journal entry on Thursday, January 1, 1925. He said, "I woke up this bright sunny new year's morning in the land of liquid sunshine, Honolulu Hawaii. Had breakfast and spent the morning at the L.D.S. mission home. At noon Elder Don Nelson and I left for Luke field where we spent the afternoon looking about the field. We returned at five thirty after which I took in a movie."<a href="/devotionals/doug-watson#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />I will be forever grateful for that young 23-year-old aerial photographer, Willard James Watson, my grandfather, for documenting things of his testimony for me. I never met my grandfather. In 1950, at the age of 50, he passed away, before I was born. &nbsp; <br /><br />One day, I found his journal and began to read it. It took me into the early hours one morning. I had come to the end of his writings but could not put it down. Something told me there was more I needed to know inside. I searched the whole journal again when finally, in the very back, there was a page and part of the cover that contained a small pocket. &nbsp; <br /><br />These certificates are just some of the things I found in that small pocket. I know he left them for me to document his life and that he had a testimony of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. &nbsp; <br /><br />Have you documented your testimony? &nbsp; <br /><br />Let me give you my definition of a documented testimony. A documented testimony is something you have felt, heard, seen, read, experienced, or written, and you cannot find anything in this life to tell you it is not true. &nbsp; <br /><br />I pray today that the Holy Ghost will help each of us document, in some form, our testimony. It could be in your mind, your heart, your soul, or in some form of written documentation. &nbsp; <br /><br />In Doctrine and Covenants, section 62, it reads, "Nevertheless, ye are blessed, for the testimony which ye have borne is recorded in heaven for the angels to look upon; and they rejoice over you."<a href="/devotionals/doug-watson#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to talk about documenting your testimony in three areas: our minds, our hearts, and our souls. &nbsp; <br /><br />First, our minds. Let's talk about ways we can document our testimonies in our minds. This could be something you have heard, seen, read, or even written that the Holy Ghost has testified to you is true. In the Book of Mormon, there are many accounts of the Savior testifying. The multitudes saw the Savior and were moved to tears knowing it was Him. &nbsp; <br /><br />3 Nephi 17:5 reads, "And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them."<a href="/devotionals/doug-watson#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Have you ever had experiences that moved you to tears? &nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to share with you some personal experiences I have had that I documented as part of my testimony. In my journal, I documented the following experience I had right here on this campus. &nbsp; <br /><br />Dated Tuesday, September 7, 1999. I titled it "Meeting the Prophet." I wrote,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Today was one of the greatest days of my life. It was like a dream come true for me. I was able to meet the prophet today. The spirit has been in such abundance on the college campus this week, in anticipation for President Gordon B. Hinckley to be here to dedicate the new Spencer W. Kimball building. &nbsp; <br /><br />I have been serving on the dedication committee and felt the spirit preparing me for what he would teach us. The tickets for the dedication were being handed out to random staff, faculty and students to be present at the Kimball building. Upon receiving a ticket in the campus mail to attend, my heart felt as if it had stopped and I was touched by the spirit to know I would be seated in the first row directly in front of President Hinckley.</p>
<p>As I sat there that day, I was able to look into the eyes of the prophet, and, without any doubt, I knew he was a prophet of God. The Spirit bore in my mind a strong testimony of him to me. I know that he talks with God. His eyes were filled with the greatest love for all. He was a gentle giant. Elder Eyring sat next to him, and he treated him with the greatest love and respect, knowing he was the true prophet of God on earth today. &nbsp; <br /><br />What an awesome experience, to have sat at the feet of the prophet. It was also a pleasure to be able to attend a luncheon with President Hinckley after the dedication, and I was able to meet him and shake his hand. &nbsp; <br /><br />I then wrote this: "It has been a great day for me in my life. This is a journal entry day. &nbsp; <br /><br />Little did I know the Lord had been preparing me for this day several years prior, while serving as a bishop. I remember a dream I had where I met the prophet. In that dream it was President Brigham Young. Not knowing what that dream would mean to me when I had this experience with President Hinckley, I was touched to know he was a true prophet of God. Later that day, we were all taught by him, in the Hart Building, about not breaking the chain of eternal families. &nbsp; <br /><br />This was an event in my life where I had heard and witnessed things, and I could not find anything in this life to tell me it was not true. &nbsp; <br /><br />Second, our hearts. &nbsp; <br /><br />In Doctrine in Covenants, section 64, it reads, "Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days."<a href="/devotionals/doug-watson#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />How can we document our testimonies in our hearts? &nbsp; <br /><br />My mind goes back to a scene from the television show <em>Andy of Mayberry</em>, where his son, Opie, gets a new wood-burning set and wants to use it to write on everything he sees. His father, Andy, is in the kitchen and smells something burning and goes into the living room to see an electrical cord plugged in and going out the window to the front porch, where he finds Opie burning the house numbers into the front of the house. Andy asks, "What are you doing?" Opie replies, "I want everyone to know this is our house." &nbsp; <br /><br />As in the <em>Andy of Mayberry</em> scene, and as Opie did, have you documented your testimony by burning it within your heart? &nbsp; <br /><br />In Doctrine in Covenants, section nine, it reads, "But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right."<a href="/devotionals/doug-watson#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to share another personal experience with you that was burned into my heart. Again, from my own journal, I wrote of this experience. I titled it "Being Called to Serve."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Being called to serve was a very special time for me and a very special experience with the Holy Ghost. I remember the feelings before I was called. About six months before I was called, I began to feel the Spirit talk and prompt me. I would find myself talking to myself in the mirror getting ready in the mornings. Later realizing it was the Spirit, I thought I was going crazy. The Spirit would prompt me of things that I would do when I was to be called to be bishop. &nbsp; <br /><br />I said to myself, "What are you thinking? I don't want to be bishop." &nbsp; <br /><br />I began to realize that the Holy Ghost was preparing me for the calling of a bishop. As I would pray about it, I would ask our Heavenly Father to help me to know and be prepared to accept whatever this was. I remember the most important thing that was whispered to me. It was to have love for everyone and to have the pure love of Christ, as this is His Church, and He would want me to organize and lead the ward with His pure love. &nbsp; <br /><br />After a long six months, I remember getting up on a Sunday and the Spirit touching my heart--as if it were being burnt with a wood-burning set--that today was the day. I was very emotional and shaking as I went to church. I was the first counselor to the bishop at that time, and after sacrament meeting I remember getting a phone call in the clerk's office and being asked to have my wife and me come to the stake center to meet with the stake president. &nbsp; <br /><br />I went and got my wife, Janice, and took her to a classroom and told her of the phone call and then told her I knew I was being called to be the next bishop. As we went and met with the stake president and he read the letter from the First Presidency, I was crying, and my heart was burning with the love of our Savior to know I was being called to serve in such a capacity. &nbsp; <br /><br />The stake president told me my life would never be the same. I now know what he meant. I told the stake president that I had known this calling was coming for some time and already knew who my counselors would be.</p>
<p>I later documented this in my journal:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I know the gospel of Jesus Christ to be the only true gospel and the church to be the only true church on the earth, for the Spirit has born witness to me in this calling and through my experiences in no other way of life to not be true. I have felt his presence with me. The Lord watches over his kingdom always and forever, this is my testimony in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>
<p>In documenting our testimony in our hearts, look for the things the Lord testifies to us and teaches us in the scriptures. &nbsp; <br /><br />In Doctrine and Covenants, section six, it reads, "Behold, thou art Oliver, [or Doug] and I have spoken unto thee because of thy desires; therefore treasure up these words in thy heart. Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love." &nbsp; <br /><br />Now listen to verse 21 and the Savior documenting His testimony to us: "Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the same that came unto mine own, and mine own received me not. I am the light which shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not."<a href="/devotionals/doug-watson#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a><sup></sup> &nbsp; <br /><br />I love the words in the beautiful Primary song that the Primary children have been singing in church this past year titled "If I Listen with My Heart." The words are, "If I feel the Holy Spirit as He teaches truth and right, He comforts me in times of need, He testifies of Christ. He speaks to me in quiet ways that fill my soul with peace. And if I listen with my heart I hear the Saviors voice." &nbsp; <br /><br />Third, our souls. &nbsp; <br /><br />After you have documented your testimonies in your minds and hearts with things you have seen, heard, and felt, have you documented enough that your soul could be convicted of having a testimony? I once heard someone ask this question, and it caused me to think that I <em>want</em> to be guilty of having a testimony. &nbsp; <br /><br />In another one of my favorite Primary songs, the words describe some of those quiet ways the Spirit has whispered to my soul.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Whenever I hear the song of a bird or look at the blue, blue sky <br />Whenever I feel the rain on my face or the wind as it rushes by, <br />Whenever I touch a velvet rose or walk by our lilac tree, <br />I'm glad that I live in this beautiful world Heav'nly Father created for me. &nbsp; <br /><br />He gave me my eyes that I might see the color of butterfly wings. <br />He gave me my ears that I might hear the magical sound of things. <br />He gave me my life, my mind, my heart; I thank him rev'rently for all his creations, <br />Of which I'm a part. Yes, I know Heavenly Father loves me.<a href="/devotionals/doug-watson#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a></p>
<p>This song has helped my soul to become convicted. It explains the ways in my life that have helped me to document my testimony. &nbsp; <br /><br />What could convict your soul of having a testimony? &nbsp; <br /><br />Documenting your testimony in your mind and heart prepares your soul to stand as a witness and to be convicted of having a testimony. Documenting your testimony within your soul helps you prepare for the Savior, and when you see Him eye to eye, you will know Him. &nbsp; <br /><br />In 3 Nephi, chapter 16, it reads, "Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing, for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion."<a href="/devotionals/doug-watson#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[viii]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />We are the watchmen for Him. &nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to share one final personal experience with you. Several years ago, when the Pathway program had just started, and the call for speaking partners went out, I thought that would be something to look into. I was serving on the high council in my stake and was assigned the Pathway program responsibilities. So I went out online and signed up to be a speaking partner. I was a little nervous. Then I got my first speaking partner assignment. It was a student by the name of Jacob. &nbsp; <br /><br />Jacob lived in Mexico City. He was married with three children. He spoke some English but needed some work. I was assigned to help him learn English along with the spiritual teachings of Pathway. We began to Skype each other for 20 minutes two times a week. <br /><br />We began to learn all about each other and began to be very comfortable speaking with each other every week. As time progressed, Jacob was speaking his English very well, and even his wife was joining in on Saturdays to say hi and speak a little English. I was assigned to him for three semesters. As our time was drawing to an end, I had felt a very dear friendship with Jacob and was a little sad knowing he was about to move on, but I was very happy for him. &nbsp; <br /><br />As part of my assignment on the high council, from time to time we had to give a report of our responsibilities, and it was my turn the next Sunday morning, at 7 a.m., to give that report. I thought what a great idea it would be to share my experience about Jacob with our high council. I decided to ask the stake president what he thought about Skyping my speaking partner and having him bare his testimony to our high council in English. The stake president agreed. So that Sunday morning, at 7 a.m. in our high council room, I projected my iPad on to a screen, and over a speaker we Skyped Jacob in Mexico City. He bore his testimony in English and expressed his love to all of us. This was a time when the Spirit bore his witness to the souls of 16 grown men, who were all moved to tears. The very next Saturday Skype session I had with Jacob, he asked if his family could do something for my family. As we gathered around my iPad, Jacob's wife and children proceeded to sing the first verse of "I Am a Child of God" to us in English. It was a very emotional event for my mind, my heart, and my soul. I have documented this experience in my mind; it was burned upon my heart, and it convicted my soul of knowing that it was true. There was nothing I could find anywhere that told me that what I had seen or heard or felt from this experience was not true. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Dallin H. Oaks said, "A testimony of the gospel is a personal witness borne to our souls by the Holy Ghost that certain facts of eternal significance are true and that we know them to be true."<a href="/devotionals/doug-watson#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[ix]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Some of the facts of a testimony are that we know that God the Eternal Father created all for us, that Jesus Christ is our Savior and atoned for our sins, and that the Book of Mormon is the true doctrine of Christ documented for all who read it. These are eternal and significant for our souls to know. &nbsp; <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, have you documented your testimonies in your minds, in your hearts, and in your souls enough that you can be convicted of having a testimony? When you see Him eye to eye, will you be moved to tears that you know Him and He knows you, even our Savior, Jesus Christ? &nbsp; <br /><br />I bare my witness: I know my Savior Jesus Christ lives. I know that we have a living prophet on earth today. I know the Book of Mormon is the word of God and is documentation of our Savior Jesus Christ. This is the true Church of Jesus Christ. I testify to you that if you will take the things you hear in your mind and you burn them into your heart, your soul will be prepared for the time when you see Him eye to eye, and you will know Him. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, what a privilege it is to be with you here today.&nbsp; <br /><br /> When I was young, my two older sisters faced some very serious heart challenges. Julie Ann inherited hers at birth. Kimberly's developed later in her childhood. Their conditions were unrelated to each other, but both impacted the heart. Here is a picture of these two angel sisters.</p>
<p><img alt="Sisters" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Sisters_400x300.jpg" width="400" /><br /><br />Neither of them won their battles--but what a legacy of love they both left behind. Before long, doctors became concerned that some genetic tendencies may have been passed down to me and my younger sisters. <br /><br />They felt it would be wise to do some testing on the siblings. I recall being pulled out of school and taken to a children's hospital about an hour's drive away. They conducted a series of extensive and rigorous tests on my heart. I was fascinated with all the equipment and monitors. The burning question on my young boy's mind was, "Doctor, how's my heart?" Fortunately, they found all to be well. <br /><br />I would like to fast-forward a number of years now to a time when my wife and I were awaiting the arrival of our first child. I'll never forget that first ultrasound appointment. Like any soon-to-be father, I was excited and anxious all at the same time. I wanted to know that all was well. Here is a picture of one of those ultrasounds.</p>
<p><img alt="Baby ultrasound" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/ultrasound-1_300x225.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />To my untrained eye, I could not tell which end was up. For me, the question of that day was, "Doctor, where's the heart?" <br /><br />The nurse kindly pointed out to me which little blip was the heart. "See, there's the heart," she exclaimed. I wasn't sure I did. She moved it again. "Can you see it now?" And then, to all of our surprise, she said, "Oh my, there are two hearts in there. You are having twins."</p>
<p><img alt="baby ultrasound" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Ultrasound-1-2_300x225.jpg" width="300" /><img alt="baby ultrasound" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/ultrasound-2-2_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />We gasped. My wife cried. I don't know if they were tears of joy or fear. Maybe a bit of both. <br /><br />These two experiences highlight some questions I would like to explore with you today: "How's your heart?" and "Where's your heart?" <br /><br />To begin, I would like to stress, <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The condition of our heart matters.</strong></p>
<p>President Russell M. Nelson taught, "Just as a heart's physical integrity is essential to a person's physical well-being, spiritual integrity of heart is essential to a person's spiritual well-being."<sup>1</sup> The condition of our heart matters. In a gospel context, the heart can refer to our center; it can be the seat of our desires, a receptacle of revelation, or a motivator for action. When the physical heart is not functioning properly, it is unlikely that much else will. So it is with the condition of our spiritual heart. &nbsp; <br />Elder Marvin J. Ashton once asked, "Why the heart?" He then answered, "Because the heart is a synonym for one's entire makeup.... The measure of our hearts is the measure of our total performance."<sup>2</sup><br /><br />Notice in the following scriptures how the condition of our heart impacts blessings and opportunities not only in this life but also the next: &nbsp; <br /><br />"Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart" (Psalm 24:3-4). <br /><br />"Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen? Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men" (D&amp;C 121:34-35). <br /><br />"The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7). <br /><br />"For I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts" (D&amp;C 137: 9). <br /><br />The Lord looks on the heart. As fallen men and women, we sometimes neglect matters of the heart--for much less weighty matters. The external observables can easily dominate our attention. The functioning of the heart is often quiet and subtle, not drawing much attention to itself unless problems arise. President Nelson observed, "The heart's mitral valve opens and closes about 100,000 times a day--36 million times each year.... The work of the heart goes on day after day, year after year, with or without our awareness."<sup>3</sup> If or when problems surface, some do so gradually and almost without notice, and others will turn our world upside down in a moment. <br /><br />This, therefore, begs the question, "How's my heart?" A follow-up question might be, "How do I know?" Finding such answers may not be as straightforward as is the case with our physical heart. We may not have expensive electrical equipment to assist us, but there certainly are some indicators we can pay attention to. There are meaningful measures that can help us to monitor our condition. Here are a few diagnostic questions: <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>"What are the desires of my heart?"</em><br /><br />After hearing King Benjamin's inspired address, his people described a mighty change of heart. "We have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually,"<sup>4</sup> they earnestly proclaimed. Their hearts were changed so completely they no longer desired sin. It became distasteful to them. Righteousness was the desire of their hearts. The desire of our hearts is also a great indicator of our spiritual wellness. Desire motivates behavior, unlocks blessings, and determines direction. Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught, "Our desires thus precede our deeds and lie at the very cores of our souls, tilting us toward or away from God."<sup>5</sup> In His marvelous sermon to the Nephites, the Savior promised, "And blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost."<sup>6</sup> Do we desire righteousness over worldliness? Do we desire holiness over prestige, pleasure, or praise? Such desires can be heart indicators. &nbsp; <br /><br />Another diagnostic could be:&nbsp;<em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>"How do I react to the unexpected events of life?" </em><br /><br />In James we read, "Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? Either a vine, figs? So can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh."<sup>7</sup> What does the fountain of our heart send forth? What flows freely from our mind and mouth? What unrehearsed acts play out in our lives? These all could be heart indicators. &nbsp; <br /><br />C. S. Lewis shared a profound parable-like illustration. "Surely what a man does when he is taken off his guard is the best evidence for what sort of a man he is? Surely what pops out before the man has time to put on a disguise is the truth? If there are rats in a cellar you are most likely to see them if you go in very suddenly. But the suddenness does not create the rats: it only prevents them from hiding. In the same way the suddenness of the provocation does not make me an ill-tempered man: it only shows me what an ill-tempered man I am."<sup>8 </sup>Such reactions can be heart indicators. &nbsp; <br /><br />Yet another could be, &nbsp; <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>"What do I do and think about when I don't have to do or think about anything?" </em><br /><br />President Gordon B. Hinckley, quoting George Brimhall, summarized it this way: "You can't tell the character of an individual by the way he does his daily work. Watch him when his work is done. See where he goes. Note the companions he seeks, and the things he does when he may do as he pleases. Then you can tell his true character."<sup>9</sup> What direction do we drift when left to ourselves? Such tendencies can be heart indicators. &nbsp; <br /><br />Careful and regular heart monitoring can be difficult. As we look inward, we may not like what we find. Sometimes we resist going to the doctor, because we know if a problem is discovered, there may be some painful and expensive treatment required. So it is with our heart--there may be some tough medicine ahead. Elder Maxwell taught, "The 'mighty change' required by discipleship may seem roller-coaster like, as soaring revelations bring the gravity of humbling perspective.... 'Mighty' changing, however, is mighty hard work."<sup>10</sup><br /><br />I believe Alma desired to assist us in this challenging process of heart assessing and adjusting. Studying Alma chapter five is a bit like attaching ourselves to a spiritual cardiogram. These verses are full of pointed and powerful questions which, when answered honestly, can be effective tools in aiding our spiritual growth. We find questions like "Have ye been spiritually born of God?"; "Have ye received his image in your countenances?"; "Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?"; "Can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands?"; "Are ye stripped of pride?" Imagining the great day of judgment, he asks, "How will any of you feel?"<sup>11</sup> Questions like these invite us to look deep into our heart, and not just into what we are doing but what we are becoming. Refusing to honestly inquire of ourselves "Lord, is it I"<sup>12</sup> will not absolve us of sickness festering in the background. When our heart is in trouble, sooner or later it will demand attention. Elder Maxwell warned, "If we have grown soft, hard times may be necessary. If we are too contented, a dose of divine discontent may come. A relevant insight may be contained in reproof. A new calling beckons us away from comfortable routines wherein the needed competencies have already been developed. One may be stripped of accustomed luxury so that the malignant mole of materialism may be removed. One may be scorched by humiliation so pride can be melted away. Whatever we lack will get attention, one way or another.... If our hearts are set too much upon the things of this world, they may need to be wrenched, or broken, or undergo a mighty change."<sup>13</sup><br /><br />May I share one more question from Alma chapter five? "And now behold, I say unto you my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?"<sup>14</sup> If, after undergoing careful introspection, you discover that feelings you once had have faded or that desires which once burned bright have dimmed or that your heart just isn't in it any more, you may be asking, "Can I get that feeling back?" My answer is a resounding yes! <br /><br />This takes me to my next thought. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>We can rekindle, foster, and maintain a healthy, strong, and Christ-centered heart.</strong><br /><br />During my early years as a seminary teacher, I occasionally witnessed coworkers strive earnestly to cope with professional fatigue or with frustration in a particular assignment. For some, a natural response to such conditions was to request an environmental change, new surroundings, or a fresh assignment. Sometimes such requests were granted but sometimes not. In the case of the latter, I recall a wise supervisor often saying to a fatigued or frustrated employee, "Take a journey of the heart." To such counsel, a person could say "But this won't take me anywhere. Nothing will change; I'll still be in the same surroundings facing the same conditions." Over the years, as I have reflected on this simple but profound advice, I have come to realize that a journey of the heart is perhaps one of the most important journeys we can take. It is true that such a journey may not change the world around us, but it most definitely affects how we experience the world and how the world affects us. How can we embark on such a journey? How can we get our heart from where it is to where we want it to be? <br /><br />This past Christmas, our youngest daughter, as one of her gifts to the family, made us a calendar. It was filled with colorful and creative artwork. For each month, she painted a picture to represent that season.</p>
<p><img alt="Family Calendar" height="275" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Family-Calendar_400x275.jpg" width="400" /><br /><br /> Here are a few samples of her calendar creations. Parents love to dote on their kids. This is way more fun than hanging them on the fridge. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Butterfly Hands" height="350" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Butterfly-Hand-1-4_300x350.jpg" width="300" />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="Turkey hands" height="365" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Turkey-Hand-2-4_300x365.jpg" width="300" /></p>

<p>May I spend a minute on this one--the heart?</p>
<p><img alt="heart hands" height="325" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Heart-hands_300x325.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />Here is a little demonstration on how it was made. You may need an activity idea for your next family home evening. I think there is a point to be made with this picture. Notice how the hand and heart interconnect. When it comes to the condition and conditioning of our heart, the hands and heart are interrelated. In a physical sense, the health of a heart directly impacts a body's ability to operate. Conversely, operations of the body directly impact the wellness of the heart. President Henry B. Eyring described this relationship of heart and hands, of the inner and outer, from a spiritual perspective. "The things we do are the means, not the end we seek. What we do allows the Atonement of Jesus Christ to change us into what we must be. Our faith in Jesus Christ brings us to repentance and to keeping His commandments. We obey and we resist temptation by following the promptings of the Holy Ghost. In time our natures will change."<sup>15</sup> What, then, are some things we can do to help us become? Are there small and simple things that can help facilitate a mighty change of heart? Where our body is concerned, a healthy diet and exercise can go a long way. In other words, we want to watch carefully what we take in, and strive to keep ourselves active.</p>
<p><img alt="Heart hands demo" height="275" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Heart-hands-demo_300x275.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />To the first,<strong> </strong><em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Let's watch carefully what we take into our lives. </em><br /><br />If, hypothetically speaking, a doctor were to tell me that my cholesterol levels were a bit too high, I may need to make a few dietary adjustments. I would want to pay a little more attention to what I eat. This may not necessarily involve major changes. Sometimes small but consistent improvements can have profound and lasting impacts. I may choose, for example, not to cap off every night with a favorite cream-filled cookie and milk (perhaps just every other night). <br /><br />Spiritually speaking, what we "take in" also has an impact on our heart. We must guard carefully what we look at, listen to, and even think about. All these activities plant seeds in our heart that eventually sink roots and yield fruit. Our time in front of the computer, on the TV, in our music, and with our thoughts will have effects on how we feel, what we desire, and ultimately what we become. If we can win the battle in our mind and related to that, in what we feed our senses, we have won so very much. President Ezra Taft Benson years ago reminded, "Think clean thoughts. Those who think clean thoughts do not do dirty deeds. You are not only responsible before God for your acts but also for controlling your thoughts."<sup>16</sup><br /><br />Are we getting our daily doses of that which edifies and uplifts? Are we feeding our souls with the bread of life and with living water? <br /><br />Now, let's introduce a little exercise. <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>We can engage in a variety of heart-healthy activities. </em><br /><br />Such activities include regular time on our knees, careful reading of the scriptures, devoted worship in the temple, humble partaking of the sacrament, and willing service to others. These heart-healthy habits make it very difficult for the destructive buildup of pride and selfishness to accumulate. &nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, there are some conditions of the heart that cannot be remedied without the skillful touch of a physician. I know in my heart there are corners I cannot reach or soften or mend without the help of the Great Physician. I need the Savior's healing touch. How can we access this healing and mending of the heart? We can begin by getting on our knees and praying for help. &nbsp; <br /><br />In Psalms, chapter 51, we hear the heartfelt pleading of David: "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me."<sup>17</sup><br /><br />In 2 Nephi, chapter four, a humble Nephi cries, "O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin? May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite!"<sup>18 </sup><br /><br />Thankfully, God can make of us, and of our hearts, that which we are unable to do on our own. &nbsp; <br /><br />What now are we to do with this heart we are striving to carefully monitor and faithfully condition? We turn it over to God. With this, let's shift from "How's my heart?" to "Where's my heart?" &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>As we turn our hearts over to God, clarity, peace, and strength will increase.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>The Savior taught, "No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."<sup>19</sup> If we try to lay our hearts at the feet of the world and simultaneously at the feet of the Lord, I am afraid we may not be received by either. Such a dualistic approach leads to weakness of resolve, inner turmoil, and frustration. When our eyes, on the other hand--and may I add our hearts--are "single to the glory of God,"<sup>20</sup> clarity and power flow into our lives. We find satisfaction in doing good, because we are good. We show charity because we are charitable. We extend mercy because we are merciful. We act like Christ because it is Him we face. &nbsp; <br /><br />I love the phrase, in a favorite hymn of mine, "Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love; Here's my heart; O take and seal it; Seal it for thy courts above."<sup>21</sup> I believe of all the things the Lord asks of us, what He wants most is our heart--and not just half a heart but all of it. There is something special about whole-hearted devotion. Notice the emphasis in these scriptures,</p>
<p>Half-hearted just doesn't seem to suffice.</p>
<p>Elder Maxwell taught, "If we desire fulness, we cannot hold back part! Having our wills increasingly swallowed up by the will of the Father actually means an enhanced individuality, stretched and more capable of receiving 'all that [God] hath' (D&amp;C 84:38). Besides, how could we be entrusted with His 'all' until our wills are much more like His?"<sup>22</sup><br /><br />Here is a picture of my wallet.</p>
<p><img alt="Walet" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Walet_300x225.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />It is not uncommon for it to look like this: bulging at the seams. Sadly, however, you will see it is packed primarily with receipts. Some have been in there so long they have been rubbed blank. In some cases, so much time has passed I no longer remember what they were even for. Now, this may seem like a trivial thing. &nbsp; <br /><br />In fact, for some transactions, filing away a receipt is a wise practice. In my case, however, endlessly hanging on to a receipt is often an indication that I am not confident with my purchase. I am not quite sure I made the right choice, and I want a way out. On the other hand, if you see me throw away a receipt, you can know how I feel about my decision. I am staying with it. I am committed. Are we hanging on to spiritual receipts? Are we resisting full commitment? Are we waiting to get disappointed or expecting something to break? Do we want a foot in the Church but also a foot out in case we need an easy exit? Maybe we wonder if it is safe to trust God with our heart. I promise, you can. When it comes to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, this is a receipt you can throw away. You can commit--whole-heartedly, no looking back, all in. President Eyring testified that we believe in a "perfectly loving, all-powerful, all-knowing Father in Heaven, whose whole purpose, as that of His Beloved Son, is to give us eternal life, to give us all that He has, and to bring us home again in families to the arms of His love."<sup>23</sup><br /><br />Go with me now to the Sea of Galilee following the Savior's resurrection.</p>
<p><img alt="Christ talking with his Apostles" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Christ-with-apostles_400x200.jpg" width="400" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>As if to measure the depth of Peter's commitment, the Savior inquired of him carefully three times. Here we read, "Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep."<sup>24</sup><br /><br />Elder Jeffrey R. Holland offered a tender elaboration of this account in the October 2012 general conference. &nbsp; <br /><br />"Jesus responded ... perhaps saying something like: 'Then Peter, why are you here? Why are we back on this same shore, by these same nets, having this same conversation? Wasn't it obvious then and isn't it obvious now that if I want fish, I can get fish? What I need, Peter, are disciples--and I need them forever. I need someone to feed my sheep and save my lambs. I need someone to preach my gospel and defend my faith. I need someone who loves me, truly, truly loves me, and loves what our Father in Heaven has commissioned me to do. Ours is not a feeble message. It is not a fleeting task. It is not hapless; it is not hopeless; it is not to be consigned to the ash heap of history. It is the work of Almighty God, and it is to change the world. So, Peter, for the second and presumably the last time, I am asking you to leave all this and to go teach and testify, labor and serve loyally until the day in which they will do to you exactly what they did to me.'"<sup>25</sup><br /><br />This is not a half-hearted commitment the Savior is seeking. This is whole "heart, might, mind and strength."<sup>26</sup> I know He wants us with Him not just for today or for tomorrow but for always. &nbsp; <br /><br />Often opportunities to demonstrate our depth of commitment, our shore-of-Galilee-moments, come when disappointment and trials appear. When the floodwaters of heartache and sorrow flow, what rises to the surface? Will our hearts stay true? Elder Holland put it this way: "It is easy to be righteous when things are calm and life is good and everything is going smoothly. The test is when there is real trial or temptation, when there is pressure and fatigue, anger and fear, or the possibility of real transgression. Can we be faithful then?"<sup>27</sup> Such faithfulness, even in the midst of suffering and sorrow, was tenderly exemplified in an account told by Elder Maxwell: "Consider unselfish Melissa Howes, whose comparatively young father died of cancer several months ago. Just before, Melissa, who was then nine, was voice in family prayer, pleading, 'Heavenly Father, bless my daddy, and if you need him more than us, you can have him. We want him, but Thy will be done. And please help us not to be mad at you.'"<sup>28</sup><br /><br />The Savior gave us a perfect example of whole-hearted submission. From the Garden of Gethsemane, in agony beyond human comprehension, he cried, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."<sup>29</sup></p>
<p><img alt="Christ in Gethsemane" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Christ-in-Gethsemane_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />We will have many opportunities throughout our lives to show where our heart is. In fact, every sacrifice, every act of kindness, every offering of time, talent, and means are small ways we show God where our heart truly lies. Such sacrifice, Elder Ballard taught, "provides an opportunity for us to prove to the Lord that we love him more than any other thing."<sup>30</sup><br /><br />Elder Michael Teh witnessed just such a demonstration. He recalled, "May I conclude with the story of a 73-year-old widow whom we met during our trip to the Philippines: <br /><br />"When the earthquake struck the island of Bohol, the home that she and her late husband had worked so hard to build crumbled to the ground, killing her daughter and grandson. Now alone, she needs to work to support herself. She has started taking in laundry (which she does by hand) and has to go up and down a good-sized hill several times a day to fetch water. <br /><br />Elder Teh continues, "When we visited her, she was still living in a tent. These are her words: 'Elder, I accept everything that the Lord has asked me to pass through. I have no hard feelings. I treasure my temple recommend and keep it under my pillow. Please know that I pay a full tithing on my meager income from doing laundry. No matter what happens, I will always pay tithing.'"<sup>31</sup><br /><br />Now, I do not know much about this sweet sister, but I do know something about her heart. By what she has and will yet sacrifice, I know what she loves, and I know where her heart is. <br /><br />The Savior taught, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."<sup>32</sup><br /><br />It is my hope that in all our comings and goings, in all our endeavors, we will pause from time to time and remember to ask ourselves, "How's my heart?" and "Where's my heart?" It is my prayer that we will all have the strength to make changes where needed and the faith to commit our lives to God--with all our hearts. <br /><br />May I conclude with my testimony? It is simple but from my heart. I know Heavenly Father loves you. He sent His son. I know Jesus lives and loves you. He gave his life so we might live. I know Joseph Smith saw and experienced just what he said he did in that sacred grove. He gave his all so that we might enjoy all the blessings of the gospel in these the latter days. May we always be true to these great legacies of love is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Sister Gilbert is a native of Provo, Utah.&nbsp; She graduated from Brigham Young University in Family Science and taught elementary school before becoming a full-time homemaker.<br /><br />Sister Gilbert has served in multiple ecclesiastical roles, including Primary president, seminary teacher, and Gospel Doctrine instructor.<br /><br />She and her husband, Clark, were married as they graduated from BYU. They are the parents of eight children.&nbsp; Sister Gilbert has a love for learning, a passion for her family, and a commitment to the gospel.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>When I start to worry about unknown paths, I think of a phrase the Savior used throughout the scriptures to comfort both early disciples and the latter-day prophet, Joseph Smith. &nbsp;"Fear not, little flock"<a href="/devotionals/sister-christine-c-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> are words that reassured disciples and prophets and can be a source of strength for us today.&nbsp; <br /><br /> Two years ago as my husband and I sat in President Uchtdorf's office and were extended this assignment at BYU-Idaho, I felt a bit of fear as I thought about such a huge responsibility and all the demands of our growing family.&nbsp; While the conversation continued that day, it was as if the Savior Himself was whispering in my ear, "fear not, little flock." &nbsp;My heart filled with peace and comfort as President Uchtdorf provided two distinct and direct forms of counsel: "just be yourselves" and "teach the importance of the family by involving your family."&nbsp; <br /><br />As we have prayed and thought about that charge from a member of the First Presidency, it has led us to many different impressions of how we could teach the importance of the family as part of our service at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; When we first arrived in Rexburg, the university created a video to introduce our family to the students. &nbsp;I would like to play that video one last time today <a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/Meet+the+Gilberts/0_jombenv7">(<em>Meet the Gilberts</em> video)</a>.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope you noticed how the video reveals a window into our family's life and shows President Gilbert teaching the importance of standing for the family in our day.&nbsp; We have tried to share the experiences of our family in other ways by&nbsp;inviting wards into our home each week with our children for family home evening and&nbsp;giving glimpses into our daily life as we shared regular messages on social media.</p>

<p>Also, (picture #3) we have prepared devotional addresses focusing on the family and taught each semester in the Eternal Family course.</p>

<p>Another area we have had strong feelings about is encouraging the students at BYU-Idaho to develop a more consistent culture around dating and courtship.&nbsp; This has resulted in holding&nbsp;regular Date Nights and encouraging students to go on dates.&nbsp;As we have tried to teach the importance of the family, each of these efforts has reinforced to us how important families are in Heavenly Father's plan.</p>

<p><br />In this final devotional address, I will share two lessons that have strengthened and brought courage to our little flock. &nbsp;These lessons are accompanied by very personal and pivotal experiences that have taught me that happiness in family life is achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. <br /><br />LESSON #1: <strong>Families are created on the Lord's timetable, not ours</strong>.&nbsp; <br /><br />I recognize that not everyone in this life will be able to marry or have children of their own.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be easier if we could completely control the timing of these sacred events?&nbsp; Finding the right spouse is just the beginning on a long road of family life.&nbsp; We have shared with many of you the struggles we had in dating and courtship.&nbsp; President Gilbert seemed to know immediately that we should be married.&nbsp; For me, the answer took time and some level of sacrificing things I had been planning on; but the answer did come! &nbsp;In hindsight, I'm grateful for the process because it allowed us to establish our courtship on FAITH and PRAYER, and it helped prepare us for more difficult decisions and experiences ahead.&nbsp; <br /><br />The need to understand the Lord's timetable showed up later in our marriage as we sought to have children.&nbsp; I vividly remember starting the conversation about whether it was the right time for us to begin our family.&nbsp; Fears that I didn't realize were deep down inside me started to set in.&nbsp; I remembered kneeling as a young girl at the side of my bed and pouring out my heart to Heavenly Father, asking for help to get my body to work right. &nbsp;I feared that my complications might hinder my ability to have children someday.&nbsp; Heaven answered those prayers by an inspired mother who recognized my symptoms and arranged early on for the right medical care. &nbsp;Several years later I let out a sigh of relief as I received my patriarchal blessing promising that I would know the joys of motherhood.&nbsp; Years later, as my new husband and I discussed this topic together, I felt his RESPECT, LOVE, and COMPASSION for me with all of my concerns and insecurities.&nbsp; We walked together in FAITH and PRAYER to start our family.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I had known how difficult it would be to get our children here, I would have moved faster and more diligently!&nbsp; Today when you see our family of eight healthy children,&nbsp;it may be hard to believe that getting most of them here included countless tests, ultrasounds, fertility treatments, medical miracles, tears, and endless prayers.</p>

<p>At this moment in time, the story of our family weaves together beautifully, and we can see many purposes--including sharing our family with you for the past two years. &nbsp;This path provided an amazing opportunity for us to act in FAITH and taught us the lesson that families are created on the Lord's timetable, not ours. <br /><br />LESSON #2: <strong>Challenges can bring us closer to our families and to the Lord.&nbsp; </strong> <br /><br />We know that each of our lives will be filled with challenges.&nbsp; My challenges won't be the same as yours; but if we let our trials lift us, they can bring us closer to our families and to the Lord.&nbsp; Elder Quentin L. Cook has said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The refiner's fire is real, and qualities of character and righteousness that are forged in the furnace of affliction perfect and purify us and prepare us to meet God.<a href="/devotionals/sister-christine-c-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>A literal refiner's fire for our family began ten years ago tomorrow. &nbsp;We were living in Rexburg with our then six children, under the age of 10.&nbsp; Our twin daughters, Mary and Grace, were not even two months old. &nbsp;When moving to Rexburg the year before, we bought land and started building our home.&nbsp; We planned to raise our children in this home and gave thought and purpose to every detail. &nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of March 29, 2007, I awoke early to feed and settle our little babies, help the older children get ready, and send Paige (our kindergartener) and James (our 4<sup>th</sup> grader) out the door for school.&nbsp; I left the twins and three-year-old Emma with a sister who was visiting and attempted to drive the preschool carpool for the first time in many months. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This carpool just happened to be through the same neighborhood where the home we were building was located.&nbsp; I loved every chance I had to drive by and see the progress.&nbsp; It was an unusually windy day; and as the roof of our new home came into view, I could see dust billowing over the top of the house.&nbsp; As I turned the corner, I realized it wasn't dust but smoke accompanied by flames coming through the upstairs windows.&nbsp; Our five-year-old Johnny in the backseat screamed, "Mom!&nbsp; THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE!!"&nbsp; With the combination of wind and lack of pressure from the nearby fire hydrants, it was an impossible task to salvage anything.&nbsp;Over the next few minutes, Clark (who raced to my side from campus) and I watched as our beautiful home burned to the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="In front of the house burning down." height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/House-Burning_250x300.jpg" width="250" /></p>
<p><br />While this was for us a very visible and financially difficult trial, heaven was mindful of our needs.&nbsp; I will never forget how in the days and months after the fire our family became the recipients of countless acts of love and service. &nbsp;We were able to find peace as our family relied heavily on FAITH and PRAYER like never before.</p>
<p><img alt="Standing inside their burnt home." height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Insite-Burnt-House_225x300.jpg" width="225" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(The kids even thought it was an adventure the day we dressed in black and took this picture in the ruins of our home.)&nbsp; We learned powerful lessons in REPENTANCE and FORGIVENESS as we faced mistakes that had been made and moved on.&nbsp; Most of all, we grew closer as a couple and as a family while we WORKED together to build our home back up again.&nbsp; This is a picture of our family 18 months later.</p>
<p><img alt="Family photo with temple behind them." height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Family-Picture-temple-in-background_225x300.jpg" width="225" /></p>
<p>At this point, we were settled in the rebuilt home and had just welcomed our little baby Lucy who miraculously came to us without any of the earlier mentioned medical help. &nbsp; <br /><br />I am a witness that challenges can bring us closer to our families and to the Lord as we are willing to learn and grow from the trials we face.&nbsp; <em></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We hope that you will remember our commitment to the family and our efforts to share our family and fulfill the charge we received in our assignment at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; We hope you will also remember that we aren't perfect and that we have simply tried to do our best.&nbsp; So "fear not, little flock."&nbsp; You can find assurance even when His timetable is not what you expect and even when you face hardships in your lives.&nbsp; I know that as each of us strives to establish and maintain our marriages, families, and lives on the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ, we can find joy and happiness. <br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>BYU-Idaho President</p>
<p>Clark G. Gilbert became the 16<sup>th</sup> president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in April 2015. <br /><br />President Gilbert brings a range of academic and professional experiences to his assignment in Rexburg. Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho in 2015, President Gilbert served as CEO of Deseret News Publishing Company and Deseret Digital Media. He also served as an associate academic vice president at BYU-Idaho, overseeing the implementation of online learning and the Pathway program. As a deeply committed teacher, President Gilbert had administrative responsibility for the Learning Model at BYU-Idaho. Prior to coming to Rexburg, he was a professor of entrepreneurial management at the Harvard Business School where he taught and studied in the field of organizational innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gilbert graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor's degree in International Relations. He earned a master's degree in East Asian Studies from Stanford University and a doctorate degree in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It was a pioneer's heart that enabled the Lord to gather His Saints at the opening of this dispensation.&nbsp; Those early pioneers brought a spirit of frugality, a faith and optimism for the unknown, a longing for prophetic direction, and a spirit of personal sacrifice to their trek west.&nbsp; It was those same attributes that allowed the Lord to reveal the ideas and innovations needed to gather His people . . . .<br /><br /> At BYU-Idaho we draw on that same pioneer's heart, a gift of the early settlers who came to this valley and eventually founded this college.&nbsp; The pioneer's heart has been preserved by the Lord in the very location of this campus.&nbsp; It has been carefully cultivated in the Spirit of Ricks.&nbsp; Regardless of its origin, the pioneer's heart was held in this valley "for such a time as this"&nbsp;when the Lord would significantly expand His educational gathering across the Church.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p><br />These words come directly from my inaugural response.&nbsp; Today, I would like to explore once again how we can preserve the pioneer's heart even in periods of great change.&nbsp; In doing so, I will draw heavily on the institutional identity of BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; I hope you will recognize what President Henry B. Eyring has taught--that our students can learn patterns for their own lives by watching the people and the work of the university.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp; <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><strong><em>Spirit of Frugality</em></strong> <br /><br />A spirit of frugality is the first characteristic in preserving the pioneer's heart. &nbsp;Forward-thinking pioneers realize that the very uncertainty of their journey requires the preservation of resources for uncharted paths.&nbsp; In his foundational address <em>A Steady, Upward Course,</em> President Henry B. Eyring discusses the turbulent future BYU-Idaho students will face: "We will live for better or for worse with rapid change and the uncertainty it brings.&nbsp; You and I want to make that change work for the better for us and not for the worse."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>&nbsp; In fact, President Eyring mentions the word "change" over forty different times in his message.&nbsp; Later in the talk he turns to the topic of frugality.&nbsp; He uses phrases like "doing more with less," "the management of resources," and "spartanism." When I first recognized these clear themes in his talk, I began to highlight references to change in green and references to frugality in red.&nbsp; At first I thought I had found two separate talks within an overall message--one talk on change and another on frugality.</p>
<p><img alt="Marked up foundational addresses" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Foundational-addresses_300x200.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>However, the more I studied his message for the university, the more I realized that these themes were actually one and the same.&nbsp; In other words, I believe President Eyring was trying to teach us that there is a relationship between being frugal and being innovative.&nbsp; You see, when we are frugal, we cannot get very far without asking whether we are on the right path, on His path.&nbsp; Being prudent with the Lord's resources also allows us the flexibility to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, keeping nimble as the terrain changes.&nbsp; For example, when BYU-Idaho first started the Pathway program, wise leadership counseled us to start with only three pilot sites.&nbsp; As we experimented, we found many changes to our initial assumptions that needed considerable adaptation.&nbsp; Because we were still small, we could pivot and change, allowing us to learn from our early efforts.&nbsp; <br /><br />This has implications in our personal lives as well.&nbsp; I remember when Sister Gilbert and I were asked to leave Boston and come to Rexburg.&nbsp; I was grateful that we were living well within our means and that we had some savings so when a new direction came, we could follow without encumbrance.&nbsp; The spirit of frugality also provides more than simple flexibility.&nbsp; A sense of scarcity, financial or personal, keeps us reliant on the Lord and reminds us of our dependence on Him.&nbsp; <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><strong><em>A Faith and Optimism for the Frontier</em></strong> <br /><br />The second characteristic required to preserve the pioneer's heart is a faith and optimism for the unknown that comes on the frontier.&nbsp; Again, President Henry B. Eyring has taught that "[t]he purpose of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to change you so that you're not trying to resist change."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a>&nbsp; Change can be frightening, but facing such fear with faith and optimism is what the Lord expects of His pioneers.&nbsp; In fact, Elder Kim B. Clark has taught that "[i]f you want to know the Savior, go to the frontier because that is where you will see Him in action.&nbsp; It is at the frontier where He does <em>His </em>work."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> <br /><br />At BYU-Idaho, that frontier came with President Hinckley's announcement of a student-centered, teaching-focused university.&nbsp; For BYU-Pathway Worldwide, those frontiers involve distributed gatherings using online and onsite instruction to build hope and confidence in students across the Church.&nbsp; A <em>new</em> frontier is emerging for both institutions through prophetic counsel given to stay close to each other.&nbsp; BYU-Pathway needs the expertise of the faculty and the strength of the online organization on this campus.&nbsp; BYU-Pathway also needs the modesty and frugality so well modeled from the faculty and staff on this campus.&nbsp; In turn, BYU-Idaho needs the opportunity to serve a worldwide Church made possible through BYU-Pathway.&nbsp; Consider President Henry B. Eyring's inaugural response in 1971 where he said: "Finally, I believe the community which education should serve is the whole world.&nbsp; Just as our obligation is to our local students . . . We must also find ways for this college to serve young people . . . who may not be able to come to this campus."&nbsp; Elder Bednar spoke to this same charge in his inaugural response where he described the need "to serve ever better the thousands of students we have on campus while simultaneously reaching out to bless the lives of tens of thousands of young latter-day Saints throughout the world."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> &nbsp;The need for BYU-Idaho to serve a worldwide Church is grounded in its prophetic destiny.&nbsp; The need for BYU-Idaho to stay close to BYU-Pathway also provides added protection to help avoid overshooting the needs of its own students right here on campus.&nbsp; You see, many of the students across the Church are not so very different from the everyday students we might unknowingly look past on campus. <br /><br />I have been speaking of institutional frontiers.&nbsp; Of course, there are also personal, spiritual frontiers for each of us individually.&nbsp; I remember a time when Sister Gilbert and I were living in Boston and President Hinckley extended a challenge to the whole Church to read the Book of Mormon by the end of the year.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a>&nbsp; Sister Gilbert and I had already been searching for direction in several career choices, and we took this invitation as a gift to go further in our own efforts to be close to the Spirit.&nbsp; It was during this very season that we received an unplanned call from Elder Kim B. Clark to consider coming to BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; In hindsight, Christine and I believe we were ready for such an invitation because we were searching for the frontier in our own lives.&nbsp; Each of you will have opportunities to go to your own spiritual frontiers.&nbsp; Remember, the Lord's pioneers go to the frontier.&nbsp; They are not satisfied to stay where they are or to stay who they are.&nbsp; The Lord's pioneers change, they repent, and they go to the hard places the Lord needs them to go. <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><strong><em>A Longing for Prophetic Direction</em></strong> <br /><br />The third characteristic in preserving the pioneer's heart is to seek prophetic direction.&nbsp; You see, it is not enough to simply be willing to go to new places.&nbsp; We need to want to go to the places the <em>Lord</em> wants us to go.&nbsp; To know that, we need direction and guidance from His servants.&nbsp; In this sense, the Lord's pioneers are very different from the world's pioneers. &nbsp;Both groups came to the frontier, but the world's pioneers came seeking adventure, wealth, or even self-ambition.&nbsp; In contrast, the Lord's pioneers came under the direction of a prophet, and this made them unique.&nbsp; Even the vanguard pioneers who went out ahead of the body of the saints went <em>under the direction</em> of Brigham Young.&nbsp; With the Lord's pioneers, there was a spiritual deference, even with their pioneering initiative.</p>
<p><img alt="Picture of pioneers" height="150" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Picture-of-Pioneers_475x150.jpg" width="475" /></p>
<p>Let me describe again how this works at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; In his announcement of the creation of the university, President Hinckley introduced the school as having a "unique role" that would be "distinctive from the other institutions of higher education."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a>&nbsp; That announcement included an unequivocal declaration that the school would be teaching-oriented and that effective teaching and advising would remain the primary responsibilities of its faculty.&nbsp; President Hinckley also described calendaring innovations and advancements in technology that would allow the school to reach many more students.&nbsp; Regarding our curriculum, President Eyring later added clarification to President Hinckley's announcement: "He said there would be focus, not a growth and spread, in the academic offerings.&nbsp; He expected that people would willingly sacrifice what they do best and love most for what the Lord wants even more for our students."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a>&nbsp; Accordingly, curriculum would not simply focus on adding more and more disciplinary content but on building "natural leaders who know how to teach and how to learn."<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>&nbsp; All of this is part of what Elder Bednar meant when he described BYU-Idaho as a ship of curious workmanship, different from other educational models of the world.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, having prophetic counsel does not mean we have all the answers.&nbsp; President Hinckley did not explain to us how the three-track system would work or how our online courses should be designed.&nbsp; President Eyring did not tell us how many academic programs we should have.&nbsp; But there is on this campus a spiritual deference that comes when we seek prophetic direction.&nbsp; I have seen how our employees lean on BYU-Idaho's foundational addresses to find guidance in their work.&nbsp; I have seen it as our deans review proposals for new degrees.&nbsp; I have even seen it from a department that rewrote their entire senior capstone project once the faculty realized they were overshooting the needs of the majority of everyday students.&nbsp; I am grateful for so many of the Lord's pioneers who have studied the prophetic direction given to this university and sought to innovate within the parameters the Lord has set. <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><strong><em>Spirit of Personal Sacrifice</em></strong> <br /><br />Finally, preserving the pioneer's heart requires personal sacrifice.&nbsp; I shared the following story on the day of the announcement of BYU-Pathway Worldwide.&nbsp; It comes from Elizabeth Claridge McCune who wrote of her father's call to serve in the Mission on the Muddy.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a>&nbsp; The exchange came during a meeting where Brigham Young simply called out names at a conference for those assigned to the mission.&nbsp; When Elizabeth heard her father's name called, she cried and cried.&nbsp; Trying to console her (and I'm paraphrasing), a friend said, "I don't know why you are so sad. &nbsp;My father's name was called, and there is no way he'll go." &nbsp;Elizabeth replied in tears, "My father wouldn't be my father unless he would go." <br /><br />I felt echoes of this story in the lives of so many Pathway employees as they watched a live stream of the announcement of BYU-Pathway Worldwide.&nbsp; Beyond the initial excitement, there was also some trepidation when President Uchtdorf announced that the new organization would be moving to Salt Lake City.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Meeting of Pathway Employees" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Pathway-Employee-Meeting_300x200.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>Throughout the ensuing weeks, many of those employees had to ask whether their call to the frontier would require a modern sacrifice--affecting not just livelihoods, but also whole families.&nbsp; With his approval, I share the story of one of those BYU-Pathway employees.&nbsp; The note was titled "The Pioneer Spirit," and it comes from Bryan Pope:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tuesday's announcement has become a waypoint in our lives. &nbsp;It is a point that JaNan and I will look back on and mark the progress of our faith and our testimonies of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; <br /><br />My great grandfather helped settle this valley. &nbsp;He was the first to dry farm on the Rexburg bench. &nbsp;The grain was so hard he had to pull his wagon all the way to Mud Lake to find a mill strong enough to grind it. &nbsp;My youth was spent following in my grandfather's legacy--dry farming, ranching, and serving others. &nbsp;JaNan and I have worked very hard so that we could return to Rexburg and raise our family in the shadow of that legacy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tuesday marked the day that we decided that living in their legacy is insufficient, and that we need to harness their pioneering spirit and forge our own legacy of faith. &nbsp;We feel called to this work and know that in our extremity the Lord will bless both this program and our family--Minerva Teichert could not have known how well she painted our feelings.<a href="/devotionals/president-clark-g-gilbert-final-devotional-winter-2017#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a></p>
<p><img alt="Painting of pioneers" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Winter%202017/Graphics/Pioneers-Heart_262x300.jpg" width="262" /><br /><br />Thus, I end where I started.&nbsp; The painting by Minerva Teichert shows a pioneer sister beaconing all of us to forge our own legacy of faith and to gather for His purposes. <br /><br />Some of you might say: "Wow, President.&nbsp; I don't know if I can make those kinds of sacrifices."&nbsp; But you do and you can.&nbsp; I see it in a first generation university student who is forging his own path to succeed here at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; I see it in a new married couple who is weighing decisions about work, graduation, and when to start a family.&nbsp; I see it in a student who is trying to overcome anxiety and is not sure how to do it. &nbsp;And, of course, I see it in so many of our faculty and other employees who are searching to become the Lord's pioneers here at this unique and distinctive university.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is my prayer that each of us can preserve the pioneer's heart by maintaining a spirit of frugality, a faith and optimism for the frontier, a longing for prophetic direction, and a spirit of personal sacrifice.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also hope you know what a special road you have ahead of you with President Henry J. Eyring and his wife, Sister Kelly Eyring.&nbsp; They love this place and you students like we do, and I know you will love them.&nbsp; It is impossible for us to tell you how much we will miss serving with you.&nbsp; But I also hope you will remember that when the call came to our family and so many others, we responded with the faith and optimism of the Lord's pioneers.&nbsp; <br /><br />As we say farewell, I invite our family to the podium.&nbsp; We love you, and we will continue to pray for your success in the Lord. <br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>General Authority Seventy</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elder L. Whitney Clayton was sustained as a&nbsp;General Authority Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on March 31, 2001. He has served as a member of the Presidency of the Seventy since 2008 and was named Senior President of the Quorums of the Seventy on October 6, 2015. He assists Elder Dallin H. Oaks in supervising the Mexico Area and Elder Jeffrey R. Holland in supervising the Middle East/Africa North Area. <br /><br />Elder Clayton served as a counselor in the South America South Area Presidency from 2002 to 2003 and as President from 2003 to 2006 while living in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Previously he served as an Area Seventy for the North America West Area for six years.<br /><br /> He has served in a number of Church callings, including full-time missionary in Peru, regional representative, counselor in a mission presidency, stake high councilor, bishop, stake mission president, and Gospel Doctrine teacher. <br /><br />Elder Clayton earned a bachelor's degree in finance at the University of Utah and a law degree at the University of the Pacific. He was an attorney in California, USA, from 1978 to 2001.<br /><br /> Elder Clayton was born in Salt Lake City, Utah on February 24, 1950. He married Kathy Ann Kipp in August 1973. They are parents of seven children.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>President Gilbert; members of the faculty, administration, and staff of BYU-Idaho; graduates; brothers and sisters; and friends, Kathy and I are very grateful to be here tonight to celebrate this marvelous occasion. Graduations are significant since they represent so much accomplishment and so many transitions. <br /><br />Let's take a few moments to offer deserved commendation to the faculty and administration of BYU-Idaho. They are charged with the noble responsibility of educating and helping prepare generations of young adults for the opportunities and challenges of life. They bear their charge beautifully. Please join me in an expression of appreciation for those who make BYU-Idaho so productive and valuable. Thank you, dear friends. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We remember the key role of parents in making a BYU-Idaho education possible for their children. In most cases, you parents have borne the financial burden of tuition, living expenses, books, and travel between home and school. Many of you sacrificed some personal enjoyment or luxury to support your student. Thank you, parents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Let's honor as well the spouses and children of today's graduates. Thank you for supporting and helping these graduating students reach this day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Finally, and importantly, let's recognize The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Church members who selflessly sustain its inspired objectives. BYU-Idaho and its sister organizations in Provo, Laie, and Salt Lake City exist because of the contributions of individual tithe payers all over the world, literally from Albania to Zimbabwe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's worth pausing for a moment to reflect on this point a little longer. The cost in dollars and cents of operating BYU-Idaho dwarfs what students and parents pay in tuition and associated expenses. The Church's expensive financial sponsorship of BYU-Idaho is absolutely intentional. It is an investment in the rising generation that is intended to be realized across decades and generations. <br /><br />Now, a few thoughts about the substance of this graduation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We call the first month of the year January after the Roman god Janus. In ancient Rome, Janus was said to be the god of beginnings and endings, of transitions, time, doorways, and passages. Romans believed Janus looked to the future and to the past, so he was usually depicted as having two opposite faces<a>.</a>&nbsp;<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> Graduations invite us to reflect both back on where we have been and forward toward where we are going. We do well to take time now and then to look backward and to look forward. Then, having taken stock, we are better prepared to move on to productive, satisfying, and useful next steps. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Let's look back together--there is so much of good to look back on and remember. There are the noble examples&nbsp;of forebears, in the generation immediately past or in earlier ones. We collectively enjoy the benefits of the exertion and faith of past generations. In 1676, Isaac Newton observed, "If I have seen further [than others] it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."&nbsp;<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> We all stand on the shoulders of those who faced down the challenges and overcame the problems of their lives. They bequeathed to us all we enjoy--&nbsp;cities with electricity and peace with prosperity. With only a few troubling present exceptions around the world, we each live in a "good land." Consider what Moses taught the children of Israel in the wilderness: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />"A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />"A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. "When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.<br />"Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of not forgetting, when we look back we should remember that our blessings of freedom in this "good land" were purchased by the blood and sacrifice of ancestors. They lived and died to bequeath to us the right to exercise our moral agency without unreasonable restraint by government action. Their social and civic legacy is fragile. Our precious freedoms are in peril, but few even notice. Freedoms can be stripped from us by force, although that is not common in the Western world today. It is more common that we negligently surrender them through apathy and self-absorption. We fail to remember the price paid to secure these rights and the immeasurable value of our national and individual birthrights. When we look back, we should recognize that our freedom came at a very high cost in human life, suffering, and treasure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most important for us to remember when we look back is the fact of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the latter days. God has set up a kingdom "which shall never be destroyed." We know that it shall overtake and eventually "consume all [other] kingdoms" and that "it shall stand for ever."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> Our sweetest blessings and happinesses are made possible by the Savior, who is "King of kings, and Lord of lords,"<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> and His Church. Whether we look back or forward, we should always remember Him. After all, we promised to remember Him when we were baptized, and we promise anew each week. Helaman taught his sons Nephi and Lehi to "remember," repeating that word 13 times in seven verses.<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> Really remembering Him in all we do is the key to mortal success.</p>
<p>As we look back, we should take time to "count [our] many blessings; name them one by one," and remember the abundant mercies and generosity of God. "What the Lord has done" will indeed "surprise" us if we account honestly for all that we enjoy.<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phrase "looking back" is sometimes paired with the sorry decision made by Lot's wife to look back&nbsp;on Sodom. Her looking back must have been influenced by some sort of yearning for the unrighteous culture that ultimately caused the "cities, and all the plain" to be destroyed. The Genesis account reminds us that our looking back should be motivated by righteous purposes only. Looking back&nbsp;to remember or long for past romantic connections, questionable conduct, or inappropriate indulgences would never be appropriate but is akin to Lot's wife's action.<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Graduations also invite us to look forward. Looking into the future is not easy for those not ordained as prophets, seers, and revelators; nevertheless,&nbsp;there are principles that extend our long-distance vision. One such principle is the law of the harvest. Paul explained the law of the harvest as follows: "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> To a much greater extent than we realize and remember, our lives are the product of our daily decisions. Faithfulness with the little daily acts of faith yields a harvest of peace and protection emotionally, physically, and spiritually. Such faithfulness&nbsp;becomes a protective shield against the "fiery darts" of the adversary.<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> Little daily acts of genuine faith are like bricks that, layer upon layer, build mansions of happiness and security for life. <br /><br />Your study and accomplishment at BYU-Idaho are a form of looking forward. One obvious benefit of a college education is that it prepares students to earn a future living. Your future career will be greatly enhanced by what you have learned here. Your learning literally opens doors of opportunity that will not swing open for those whose more limited preparation shrinks their horizons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a><br /></a><a></a></p>
<p>More important,&nbsp;your college education will bless you in nonfinancial ways as well. It will enhance your capacity to be successful marriage partners and, later, to be loving, effective parents and grandparents. Your homes will be enriched by the training you have been given here. The most important application of your learning will be in your homes. <br /><br />Your capacity to serve in the Church and in the community also has been expanded. You leave here more useful than you were when you entered. As college graduates, you join a worldwide minority who have been trained in a superior institution of higher learning. Your diploma will certify that you are an educated man or woman. One of the principal advantages of being such is that you are prepared to be self-reliant. Self-reliance is a key virtue for disciples of Jesus Christ to seek to develop in this life. A Church handbook teaches: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Self-reliance is the ability, commitment, and effort to provide the spiritual and temporal necessities of life for self and family. As members become self-reliant, they are also better able to serve and care for others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />"Church members are responsible for their own spiritual and temporal well-being. Blessed with the gift of agency, they have the privilege and duty to set their own course, solve their own problems, and strive to become self-reliant. Members do this under the inspiration of the Lord and with the labor of their own hands."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a></p>
<p>There is inevitably an element of the unknown as we consider the future. The Preacher in Ecclesiastes observed that "time and chance happeneth to them&nbsp;all,"<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> including each of us. We don't know how long we will live, how the decisions of others will affect us, or what the influences of politics and economies will be. However, as we "press forward,"<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> we don't need to see the end from the beginning. God does, and that is sufficient for us. <br /><br />Thus, when we look forward, we should not expect to see everything that is ahead. When interviewed about the process of writing fiction, the novelist E.&nbsp;L. Doctorow, who wrote <em>Ragtime</em><em>,</em> said, "It's like driving a car at night: you never see further than your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> <br /><br />The beloved hymn "Lead, Kindly Light" teaches a similar comforting thought about trusting God as we "press forward":</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Lead, kindly Light, amid th'encircling gloom;<br />Lead thou me on!<br />The night is dark, and I am far from home;<br />Lead thou me on!<br />Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see<br />The distant scene--one step enough for me."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a></p>
<p>Paul noted that "for now we see through a glass, darkly."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> Still, we do look through that glass to see all that we can. We shine the headlights into the fog or the "encircling gloom." We hold up the "kindly Light." The Lord once condemned those who did not see the "distant scene," saying, "Their hearts have waxed hard, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes cannot see afar off."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we are expected to look forward and backward and to do our best both to remember and to anticipate. The scriptural record is rich with sacred history and with prophetic prediction, and there is much to remember about the past and the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some things about the future are absolutes. Here's one: "The eternal purposes of the Lord shall roll on, until all his promises shall be fulfilled."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> <br /><br />Here's a second: "Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> That promise is still in place. Its tried and tested formula for success should not be underestimated. Keeping the commandments is powerful medicine. It prevents or greatly reduces injury to heart, mind, and emotion. By inviting the blessings of the Savior's Atonement, obedience helps heal individual broken hearts, wounded spirits, and the souls of entire nations. <br /><br />Wherever you go from here, to a greater degree than you can now imagine, your faithful adherence to the commandments of God will bless and prosper you in your "good land."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> It will bless your marriages and families. It will bless your careers and your homes. It will bring joy to your days and peace to your hearts. So go forward to your tomorrows with faith, remembering or looking back to the past and anticipating or looking forward to the future as best you can. You have more control over your tomorrows than you realize, based on your faithful adherence to the commandments. And then, having done whatever is in your power, be calm and trust in God. Things will work out for your good.<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> Remember this counsel from the author Victor Hugo: "[Have] courage for the great sorrows of life, and patience for the small ones. And .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when you have [finished] your daily task, go to sleep in peace. God is awake."<a href="/speeches/elder-l-whitney-clayton-winter-commencement-2017#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> <br /><br />I bear testimony of the loving Heavenly Father of us all, of His Beloved Son, and of the Restoration of the gospel in the latter days. May God bless and keep you all. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, this is a happy day in your lives and a very happy day in the lives of your families and friends. I am happy for you! <br /><br />I want to share a thought with you this evening about the Holy Ghost and the journey ahead. I hope it will be helpful to you. &nbsp; <br /><br />Many years ago, I served a mission in southern Germany. When I arrived in the mission field, the mission president sent me to my first area and assigned me a companion. It was a blessing to have a companion who knew the language and how to navigate around the city. It was an even greater blessing to have a companion who had a testimony of the gospel, who knew how to teach, and who loved the people and the work. &nbsp; <br /><br />The mission president had impressed upon me the blessings and protection that would come to me if I would always stay close to my companion. His concern was real and intense. I felt it, and I believed his promises. All through my mission, I stayed close to my companion. &nbsp; <br /><br />You and I experience this same pattern in our mortal journey. We prepared and qualified to come to the earth in the pre-mortal realm. We accepted the Father's plan and followed the Savior. Heavenly Father called us into mortality. Once we arrived and made sacred covenants with Him in the waters of baptism, Heavenly Father assigned us a divine companion: the Holy Ghost. &nbsp; <br /><br />That assignment means that Heavenly Father gives us the privilege to have the Holy Ghost with us all the time, all through our lives. The greatest gift God gives us in mortality is to have the Holy Ghost as our companion. &nbsp; <br /><br />The Holy Ghost knows the language; He knows the way; He knows what to do; He will guide us and warn us against danger and evil; He will bear witness of all truth; He knows how to teach us, comfort us, bless us with spiritual gifts, purify our hearts, sanctify us, and make us holy. &nbsp; <br /><br />This is why Heavenly Father has inspired His prophets to implore us with real and intense concern to stay close to this marvelous divine companion--to listen to Him and act on His promptings. Here is a beautiful example from the Prophet Joseph: &nbsp; <br /><br />Tell the people to be humble and faithful and be sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach [them what] to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom.... The Holy Ghost ... will whisper peace and joy to their souls ... and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness, and build up the kingdom of God. Tell the brethren [and sisters] if they will follow the Spirit of the Lord they will go right.<a href="/speeches/elder-kim-b-clark-winter-commencement-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />The Prophet makes it very clear that having the Holy Ghost with us is not supposed to be a rare event. The Father sent His Son to suffer and die for us so that we always could have the Savior's redeeming and strengthening power in our lives through the ministry of the Holy Ghost. Each week when we partake of the sacrament, we hear this glorious promise: "that they [might] always have his Spirit to be with them."<a href="/speeches/elder-kim-b-clark-winter-commencement-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> The Holy Ghost is always there, always ready to bless us, if we will receive that gift and stay close to our divine companion. &nbsp; <br /><br />We stay close to the Spirit by living the plain and simple principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ: &nbsp;have faith in Jesus Christ, repent of our sins, keep our covenants, say our prayers, read the Book of Mormon every day, worship in the temple, and keep the Sabbath day holy. &nbsp; <br /><br />So, brothers and sisters, this is my message to you: Just be good. Don't do anything that will drive the Holy Ghost away. Temptations are all around you. Don't let them into your heart. Stay close to your divine companion. Listen to what He tells you to do, and act on His promptings. If you do, I promise you that the Lord's blessings will flow into your lives through the power of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp; <br /><br />I know this promise is true from my own experience and by the witness of the Holy Ghost. I leave you with my witness that God lives. Jesus is the Christ. His mercy, His grace, and His love make possible the gift of the Holy Ghost, a divine companion to every one of us. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Clark G. Gilbert became the 16th&nbsp;president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in April 2015.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Gilbert brings a range of academic and professional experiences to his assignment in Rexburg. Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho in 2015, President Gilbert served as CEO of Deseret News Publishing Company and Deseret Digital Media.

<p>As you look around this evening, I hope you will remember the feeling of gathering in this auditorium with the strength of the Church in such a sacred and set-apart place. In many ways, I hope the gatherings that have happened here, at devotional and at graduation, will become a great symbol of your experience here at BYU-Idaho. And, in a distant time and place when you feel under attack or feel that your values are being challenged, I hope you will reflect back on these assemblies as a source of strength and a memory of what it feels like to gather with so many who share your values. So look around tonight. Remember this feeling. Take it into your soul and your spiritual memory. Take it with you into a future when you will need it again. In some ways, you have been living in Rivendell, and you are about to leave to the plains of Mordor, where the peacefulness and goodness of a protected place will give way to the attacks of those who do not seek for the happiness of man. But this should not hold you back or keep you from opening new doors. As J. R. R. Tolkien has penned, "The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot forever fence it out."<a href="/speeches/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-commencement-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> So as you leave tonight, leave with courage in the knowledge that you have been in a place that has prepared you for the next part of your journey. Leave with courage to know that you have been taught what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ. You can build Zion wherever you go. That starts in your own heart and in your own mind. As John Milton stated in <em>Paradise Lost</em>, "The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, [or] a hell of heaven."<a href="/speeches/president-clark-g-gilbert-winter-commencement-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> Make it a heaven. <br /><br /> Sister Gilbert and I know a little of what you feel tonight. We have now had the experience of leaving Rexburg twice--both times to new assignments that we knew would take us where the Lord wanted us to be. But as we left, we found ourselves praying that there was enough Rexburg in us. Tonight I testify that there is enough Rexburg in all of us if we will look back and draw on those experiences that prepared us here at this university. So as you leave tonight, take courage, and take Rexburg with you wherever you go. Prepare to lift and build others in your future homes, in the Church, and in your work. I leave this invitation and a promise of strength to all of you who have experienced this sacred and special place so abundantly. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>BYU-Idaho President</p>
<p>Henry Johnson Eyring became the 17th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in April 2017.<br /><br />President Eyring and his family have had a long association with Rexburg and BYU-Idaho. He first came to the area as a child, when his father, President Henry B. Eyring, served as president of Ricks College. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />He returned to Rexburg and the relatively new BYU-Idaho in 2006. Over the ensuing 11 years at the university, he has served as Associate Academic Vice&nbsp;President over&nbsp;Online Learning, Advancement Vice President, and Academic Vice President. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Previous to his work at BYU-Idaho, President Eyring worked as a strategy consultant at Monitor Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and as MBA Director at BYU in Provo. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Eyring has served in various callings in the Church, including full-time missionary in the Japan&shy; &shy;Nagoya Mission, bishop, Mission President in the Tokyo&nbsp;Japan North&nbsp;Mission, and President of the Rexburg Idaho YSA 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Stake. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Eyring earned a bachelor's degree in Geology, a Master of Business Administration, and a Juris Doctorate from Brigham Young University. While attending BYU, he married his high school sweetheart, Kelly Ann Child. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Sister Eyring graduated from BYU with a bachelor's degree in English. She has served as a stake Young Women president, Primary president, and is currently serving as a Laurel adviser. President and Sister Eyring are the parents of five children. Their three oldest children are graduates of BYU-Idaho, and their younger two children still live at home.&nbsp;They also have three grandchildren.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Quotes:</strong></p>
<p>"It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship...There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal."<br /><br /> -C. S. Lewis</p>

<p>PRES. EYRING: It's wonderful to be with you at devotional today. Sister Eyring and I appreciate the preparations you've made. More than 22,000 of you have accessed the devotional I-Learn site, and more than 800 have commented on your preparation. That will help us to enjoy a deeper learning experience. It has also allowed Sister Eyring and me to select two students, Sierra Schaefer and Howard Saavedra, who will join us at the pulpit of the BYU-Idaho Center auditorium today.<br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Our topic is the expression of friendship. Together we'll explore our power to lift one another. Each of us has the ability to bless everyone we meet, even if that meeting lasts only for an instant. It is a great opportunity and a spiritual duty. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: Each of us is a daughter or son of God, created in the image of our heavenly parents. We are spirit brothers and sisters, with a common spiritual heritage. We are all destined to be powerful and radiant beyond anything we can now imagine. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Yet our mortal frames differ dramatically. Some are more attractive by mortal standards and fashions than others. These physical differences often cause us to be treated differently. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: That is too true. I have experienced differential treatment throughout my life, particularly so in recent years. I look very different today than I did when Kelly first met me.</p>
<p><img alt="Henry J. Eyring's graduation photo" height="325" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring%202017/Graphics/Henry-J.-Eyring_225x325.jpg" width="225" /></p>
<p>SIS. EYRING: It was at the back-to-school dance at Bountiful High School in 1980. Henry had spent the summer lifeguarding, and his sun-bleached brown hair was thick and golden. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: Luckily, Kelly fell in love with me and consented to marriage before I lost my hair. It was a monumental case of what salespeople call "bait and switch." &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: As a child, Henry occasionally experienced partial hair loss due to a condition called alopecia. At times of emotional stress, such as the move from Rexburg's six-room Lincoln Elementary School to the comparatively gargantuan Madison Junior High School, his hair would fall out in spots. Fortunately, when the stress subsided, his hair grew back. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: But in 1995, when I was 32 years old and living in Utah, worries about my professional challenges and Kelly's loss of two pregnancies caused my hair to fall out completely--not just on the top of my head, but from head to toe, eyebrows included. The loss was gradual and patchy. When there was only enough hair left to make me look as though I had stood a little too close to a nuclear reactor, I asked Kelly what to do. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Henry really did look unhealthy, and his friends and business associates were worried. I invited him onto our back porch and used an electric razor to shave his head. To help him feel better, I saved what was left of his hair in a small plastic sandwich bag. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: Friends quickly grew accustomed to my new appearance, though the lack of eyebrows worried strangers, who wondered about my health. The real problem, though, was a persistent and emotionally painful case of mistaken identity. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Just six months before, Henry's father had been called to fill a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Dad's new position made him recognizable to all Church members, in addition to many other people in Utah. That meant that strangers often mistook Henry for Elder Eyring. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: [To Kelly] Personally, I don't see the resemblance. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Good for you, dear. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: For those who didn't know me before, my new appearance and my father's heightened public profile naturally led them to treat me differently than I was accustomed to. And the difference in treatment began to change the way I felt about myself. My sense of self-identity was hard to maintain, and my confidence dropped. Fortunately, over time my eyebrows grew back, and I learned to appreciate the blessing of representing my father to the many people who wish they could meet him. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: But Henry's experience has helped both of us think more carefully about making judgments based on the physical appearance of others. Particularly in the case of those we've never met, he and I try to see beyond outward appearance. We try especially hard to avoid drawing negative conclusions based solely on what we can see with our eyes. As Henry learned when he appeared to be sick, an unwelcoming or disapproving look can cause pain even when no words are spoken. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: In just the past few months, though, I've learned that a look of approval, even from a stranger, can be a wonderful blessing. Since the announcement of my job change at BYU-Idaho, walking across the campus has become even more delightful than before. Almost everyone smiles at me, and most people say hello. The emotional effect is wonderful. I feel as though I'm being carried on the shoulders of those I meet. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Though my hairstyle isn't as uniquely recognizable as Henry's, I enjoy similarly warm welcomes from you. But he and I know that not everyone enjoys this kind of confidence-boosting welcome. We wish it could be so. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: In fact, there's no reason we can't all have such experiences on this campus all of the time. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: As Henry noted earlier, each of us is truly a child of God, with inherent spiritual beauty and divine potential. Our physical appearance is the product of earthly factors, particularly genetic inheritance. Unfortunately, judgments of physical attractiveness are artificial and often mistaken relative to spiritual reality. The scriptures indicate that the Savior wasn't notable for His physical appearance in this life. But listen to this description of Him by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple: &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: "His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters."<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-spring-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Given the divine heritage of everyone in this life, we are wise to look beyond the outward appearance of those we meet. Christian scholar C. S. Lewis said it this way: &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: "It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship.... There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal."<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-spring-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Because we know that all of us are children of God with divine heritage and potential, doesn't it make sense for us to recognize them accordingly? Certainly we should make that effort as members of the BYU-Idaho family. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: Amen to that. Each member of this educational family is enrolled in a modern-day School of the Prophets, sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and presided over by President Thomas S. Monson and the members of the Church Board of Education. Here, of all places, we should greet one another warmly and enthusiastically. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: In fact, there is a formal greeting specified in the 88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. It was given by the Lord to Joseph Smith, who presided over the School of the Prophets. According to this commandment, the teacher of the school was to greet each new student with these words: &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: "Art thou a brother or brethren? I salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in token or remembrance of the everlasting covenant, in which covenant I receive you to fellowship, in a determination that is fixed, immovable, and unchangeable, to be your friend and brother through the grace of God in the bonds of love, to walk in all the commandments of God blameless, in thanksgiving, forever and ever. Amen."<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-spring-2017#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Of course, if we were to stop and give this greeting to everyone we pass on campus, we'd all be late for class. But perhaps a simple "hello" or "hi" is enough to signal our feelings of respect and friendship. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: It really doesn't matter what word we use. In fact, even a smile can be enough. The key is simply to signal our recognition and approval of those we meet. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: A friendly "hello" is more than just a greeting. To the recipient, that greeting conveys a wealth of pleasant meaning. It says, "I have noticed you. You are my peer. If time permitted, we could be friends." &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: Such a greeting is a confidence booster even when our confidence is already relatively high, as I've learned in the past two months. Think of how much more valuable it can be to someone who lacks self-confidence, someone who has few friends or is self-conscious of their appearance, as I was when my hair was falling out in patches. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: The really good news is that lifting others this way has the effect of simultaneously lifting us. When we outwardly recognize the worth of those we meet, the Holy Ghost immediately conveys to our hearts the Savior's approval and appreciation. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: Whatever spiritual and emotional burdens we may be carrying are lightened. As we attempt to build hope and optimism in others, we feel the lift ourselves. In the words of a nineteenth-century American poet, "If thee'll lift me while I lift thee, / We shall go up together!"<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-spring-2017#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: At times of personal difficulty, you may be tempted to think, "I can't lift anyone. I can't even lift myself. In fact, I'm not even sure I belong at BYU-Idaho."&nbsp;<br /><br />PRES. EYRING: But unless the Holy Ghost is telling you to go elsewhere, you know that's not true. Only the adversary would tell you that you simply don't belong here. If you are ever tempted by such thoughts and feelings, cast them out of your mind and heart immediately. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: We hope you'll believe that BYU-Idaho can be the right place for you, as it was for three of our children. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: And we promise that greeting others as though you were confident and happy here will lift not only them but also you. "If thee'll lift me while I lift thee, / We shall go up together." &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: I'd like to invite Sierra Schaefer to join me at the podium. Sierra is one of the students who accepted the challenge to say hello to those she met on campus for a full day. Sierra, tell us where you're from and how long you've been a BYU-Idaho student. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIERRA: I'm from central California, and this is my seventh semester here at BYU-Idaho. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Oh, that's wonderful. Can you describe your experience of saying hello? &nbsp; <br /><br />SIERRA: Saying hello was definitely awkward at first. I think some people gave me the head tilt and were trying to figure out if they've had a class with me before or why I was saying hello to them. But as I continued to say hello to students, I felt more comfortable and was able to look beyond what they were dressed as and what they looked like, and just say hello to everyone and treat them equally. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Good work. How did your experience make you feel? &nbsp; <br /><br />SIERRA: It made me feel great, especially the times when people said hello back. It uplifted me, and it made me feel more comfortable in my own skin, which was surprising, since I was trying to serve other people. I feel like I received service in return. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Do you think it made a difference in your life or in the lives of those that you said hello to? &nbsp; <br /><br />SIERRA: I truly hope so. I love the quote the president said from C. S. Lewis that says there're no ordinary people. I felt as I said hello to others, and as others said hello to me, it made me feel extraordinary, and I hope I did the same for them. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: That is wonderful. Thanks, Sierra. Now we'll let the men have a turn. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: Those are great insights, Sierra. I'd like to invite my new friend Howard Saavedra to come up. Howard, can you tell us where you're from and how long you've been a BYU-Idaho student? &nbsp; <br /><br />HOWARD: I was born in Lima, Peru, but right now my family lives in Salt Lake City, Utah. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: Wonderful. Howard, you had an interesting, unusual experience as you were saying hello to one fellow in particular. &nbsp; <br /><br />HOWARD: Yeah, so aside from living in Peru and in Utah, I also lived most of my life in Florida, and we bounced around different cities. And it was really hard for me to communicate with my friends that I'd met there. But as I was here and I accepted the challenge to say hello, I actually ran into one of my childhood friends, and we caught up on life. And from that experience, I know how Alma felt when he finally got reunited with the sons of Mosiah. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: In your post you mentioned that, in the beginning, you weren't sure that was your friend. &nbsp; <br /><br />HOWARD: Yeah, I didn't know who he was at first, and so I asked him. I said, "You look familiar. Where have we seen each other?" His mom was actually my Primary teacher growing up, so that was pretty cool. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: That makes me think of what it may be like in the next life, that we will see people who, on this earth, appear to be strangers, and we'll realize we knew them before. That's a great experience. What recommendations do you have for having a good experience as you greet people? &nbsp; <br /><br />HOWARD: Aside from saying hello and just smiling, I feel like a challenge that we students can have is to remember their names. I think that Joseph Smith had a very personal experience when God called him by name. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: That's wonderful. I have to say that President Gilbert is so good at that, and it's a gift I don't have. I can't remember anybody's name unless it's Henry. I'm going to work on that. Thank you very much. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now it's your turn. Please form groups of two or three and share your experiences of saying hello. For those of you joining devotional online, you can either talk with someone you've already contacted or participate via our I-Learn discussion board. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Don't feel hesitant to share negative experiences or doubts. There are no bad responses. Take a minute or two. Here we go. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: It's hard to stop such valuable conversations, but we can continue them after devotional ends today. The discussion board will stay live through Thursday night. We hope that you can see and feel the benefit of our greeting one another as friends. Ideally, saying hello to future friends we're just encountering for the first time will become a hallmark of BYU-Idaho. The emotional and spiritual benefits to us all can be vast. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Now, we feel the need to offer a gentle but serious warning to those who may say, "I don't need or want to say hello to strangers when I'm walking on the campus or taking an online class. That's my personal time; it's the only time I've got to myself. Sometimes I just need to relax and take a break." &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: It's natural to have these feelings, especially when our day is already stressful enough with assignments and deadlines and social obligations. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: However, the temptation to withdraw from others may be just that--a real temptation. Our purpose in this life is to lift our spirit brothers and sisters. They need us, and we need them, to withstand the constant temptations subtly put forward by our common adversary. To deny the sociality and support of others is to put ourselves at grave risk. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: That spiritual reality can be inferred from a passage of the Doctrine and Covenants which describes those who, when this mortal life is over, will receive no spiritual glory. Section 88 explains how each of us will, following the "quickening" of the Resurrection, inherit a kingdom of glory matched to the level of spirituality we sought in this life. Some will be fit for celestial glory, others for only terrestrial or telestial glory. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Section 88 also refers to those who will receive no glory at all. The reference in that section seems to suggest not an externally imposed punishment but rather a personal choice. Consider carefully these words: &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: "And they who remain shall also be quickened; nevertheless, they shall return again to their own place, to enjoy that which they are willing to receive, because they were not willing to enjoy that which they might have received."<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-spring-2017#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: This reference to returning to one's "own place" should make us think carefully about our attitudes toward other people. We know through modern revelation that Eve's creation saved Adam from an aloneness that was declared "not good."<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-spring-2017#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: We also know that gathering is a pervasive theme of the Lord's Church, especially in these latter days. It is the reason for BYU-Idaho's existence. This university is made possible by the tithes of all Church members, many of whom will never be able to come to the Rexburg campus, take an online course, or otherwise receive the blessing of gathering with the Saints. BYU-Idaho exists because there is spiritual safety and happiness to be found in what Elder David A. Bednar has called "righteous sociality."<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-spring-2017#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a> We gather together to share and increase our spiritual strength. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Of course, we all need some personal time during the day, time to reflect and plan and relax privately. That time might include listening to music, watching a movie, or playing a video game. But it is spiritually dangerous to establish a pattern of choosing to go to your "own place" when all around you are potential friends to lift and be lifted by. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: When we isolate ourselves from others, even in what seem to be harmless activities, we expose ourselves to the subtle influences and lies of our spiritual adversary. In our isolation we may lose the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Without realizing, we can expose ourselves to temptations of loneliness and self-doubt. Before we know it, we may fall prey to even more serious sin. Private entertainments in which we hoped to find relaxation and refreshment can turn into emotional and spiritual traps. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: A simple but powerful way to avoid these traps is to reach out with love to those around us. That's not just a way to avoid the emotional and spiritual danger of isolation; it's also a way to fulfill the prophetic promise that President Henry B. Eyring has made to the students of BYU-Idaho. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: In 2001, just one year after the announcement that Ricks College would become BYU-Idaho, President Eyring said this about you, the future graduates of this great university: &nbsp; <br /><br />HENRY B. EYRING: You can imagine the joy of an employer or a Church leader when such a graduate arrives. The graduates will be at personal peace by having kept the commandments. They will be natural leaders who know how to teach and how to learn. They will have the power to innovate and improve without requiring more of what money can buy. Those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become--and this is a prophecy that I am prepared to make and make solemnly--those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Henry and I know that this prophecy about the graduates of BYU-Idaho is being fulfilled. We have seen it in the lives of our children, who are grateful BYU-Idaho graduates. We can see it in you as well. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: A simple way to hasten the fulfillment of President Eyring's prophecy of natural leadership in your life is to greet your BYU-Idaho colleagues with a hearty hello. You'll lift them and yourself at the same time. That's natural leadership at its best. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: The good news is that every one of us can enjoy the wonderful experience of lifting and being lifted by the people around us. We don't have to become president of BYU-Idaho or look like Henry B. Eyring. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: Each of us is truly a child of God, destined to receive all of the power and beauty of our heavenly parents. We can remind ourselves of that truth by treating one another as though it is already true. There is no better place than BYU-Idaho to do that. &nbsp; <br /><br />SIS. EYRING: Let's do it together. &nbsp; <br /><br />PRES. EYRING: In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Jack and I are grateful to be here at BYU-I. I marvel that I would even have this opportunity to speak to you today. We love Rexburg, and we love this campus. We have fond memories of our college years. It's a time of learning, stretching, growing, and discovering yourself, and sometimes falling in love. I hope you feel our love today, because we love you!<br /><br />For months now, I have pictured you as I have prepared for this devotional. I have visualized your faces, your apartments, and you walking to class. There is something about this campus and the energy we feel here. You are standing on the springboard of life. My advice to you is to jump high and dream big. Imagine where you will land 10 years from now, even more firmly anchored in your faith in Jesus Christ. Along your path, may you continue to discover the incredible blessing of being a member of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />That takes me to the story of my friend Doug, who was approached by his friend, who said, "I've always wanted to talk to a Mormon. Tell me, what would be in it for me <em>if</em> I joined your church?" Some of you have responded as to what you would say under those same circumstances. But I have asked two of your fellow students to participate today to tell me what they would say. So let's begin with Rachel Northrop. Rachel, tell us where you're from, and what's your major here at BYU-Idaho? &nbsp; <br /><br />NORTHROP: I'm from Pocatello, Idaho, and I'm studying child development. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: And we discussed earlier, we both love children. It's a given, right? What would you say in such a circumstance as Doug? &nbsp; <br /><br />NORTHROP: I would draw from my own experience, what I have been blessed with. And that is a personal relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Being a part of this church has helped me learn how to pray, and through praying I've been able to feel of Their presence and Their strength. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: And how old were you when you first learned how to pray? &nbsp; <br /><br />NORTHROP: I learned to pray when I was little, but my first testimony of prayer came when I was in middle school. And I was praying about homework and was helped by Heavenly Father to finish my homework in middle school. And the Spirit testified to me that that's what had happened, that Heavenly Father did help me. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: Who taught you to pray? &nbsp; <br /><br />NORTHROP: My parents. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: Right. And your experience in church all those years? Your testimony is strong, Rachel, and I appreciate you sharing today. It's a relationship with our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. &nbsp; <br /><br />NORTHROP: Absolutely. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: Thank you. Love you. Okay, now let's have Lance Plumb come and join us, if you would please. I am looking up at Lance, today, in more ways than one. I have great respect for his height. How tall are you, Lance? &nbsp; <br /><br />LANCE: I am 6-foot-5. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: Lucky you. Now, are you married? &nbsp; <br /><br />LANCE: I am not. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: You must promise me that you will marry a tall girl. &nbsp; <br /><br />LANCE: I can't promise you that. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: Because I'm a tall girl, and when I would see a tall boy marry a short girl, I would think, "Darn it, that's not fair." Tell us where you're from, and what is your major? &nbsp; <br /><br />LANCE: I'm from Leamington, Utah, and I'm an exercise physiology major. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: And if you were in Doug's situation and someone approached you, what would you tell them about this church? &nbsp; <br /><br />LANCE: I would say that I've gained many blessings from being a part of this church, but the greatest blessing I've ever received is having a relationship with God and His Son, Jesus Christ. I know that in my life, my greatest joys and happiness come as I've had relationships with my family and my friends. And as I have been a member of this church, I've gained a relationship with God that has brought me even more happiness. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: How are you different now than you were even five years ago? &nbsp; <br /><br />LANCE: I would say I'm a much happier person. I've learned what it's like to listen to Heavenly Father's voice and be able to follow that, and it's brought me a lot of happiness because of it. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: Can you even imagine where you'll be five years from now? &nbsp; <br /><br />LANCE: Way happier than I am now. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: I promise you will if you keep living it like you do right now. Thank you so much for participating. &nbsp; <br /><br />There's something about that relationship. Now, all of you have ideas or thoughts in your minds. I'm going to give you a minute to turn to the person next to you, and would you share maybe one or two sentences about what you would say that defines your view of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Go ahead. &nbsp; <br /><br />(AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION) &nbsp; <br /><br />Did it cause you to take a fresh view of your beliefs? Someone once said, "This restored gospel of Jesus Christ is great and marvelous. To those who take the time to view it properly ... it is breathtaking." &nbsp; <br /><br />Now imagine this breathtaking visual. I see a little green plant bursting through a crack in black asphalt. Its lime-green stems have pushed the thick, coarse pavement out of its path. The bright green leaves on this sturdy stem are reaching for the sun. Nothing can stand in its way. How is this visual like us living this gospel of Jesus Christ in this world? <br /><br /> <img alt="../../../Volumes/DevotionalGraphics/2017%20Spring/Wixom/Images/sprout-1" height="250" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring%202017/Graphics/Plant-from-the-asphalt_300x250.jpg" width="300" /> &nbsp; <br /><br />President David&nbsp;O. McKay said, "The purpose of the gospel is ... to make bad men good and good men better, and to change human nature."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> That's it! The gospel of Jesus Christ is about change--constantly changing our hearts and strengthening our faith for the better. It's about progressing, becoming, and ascending upward. &nbsp; <br /><br />Alma asks us, "Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?"<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Look back over your shoulder--see where you have been and how far you have come. President Henry B. Eyring said, <em>"</em>If you are on the right path ... it will always be uphill."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />There is a Greek word, <em>metanoia</em> (<em>metonya</em>). The translation denotes a change--a change of mind, or, for example, a fresh view about God<strong>, </strong>about oneself, and about the world. The Bible Dictionary tells us that word is "repentance." Today let's consider how "repentance" is like a fresh view about God, about oneself, and about the world &nbsp; <br /><br />First, I have to confess, as a child the word "repentance" was a scary word. I viewed it as the ultimate difficult task, the very last resort--almost as if "repentance" existed in a box tied up with a ribbon and put on a shelf. I thought, <em>if</em> I were lucky enough and careful enough to obey all the commandments, I could get through this life without ever having to take the box down, untie the ribbon, and experience the process of repentance that was inside! Wrong! &nbsp; <br /><br />I did not see the fresh view it would offer me like the plant emerging through the asphalt. But I was right on one thing: repentance is a gift, and it comes from God, who loves us with a love we cannot even begin to comprehend. There is nothing we can do that will diminish that love God has for us. And this gospel of Jesus Christ gives us hope that we can change and become better through repentance. <s></s> &nbsp; <br /><br />Without repentance, we cannot progress or fulfill our purpose on earth. What makes this gift of repentance possible? It is the atoning sacrifice of our Savior, Jesus Christ. He paid the price for our sins. He said, "I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer <em>if</em> they would repent."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> He is the one that allows us to feel the relief and peace that comes when the burdens are lifted and the asphalt has cracked open. Repentance is not optional for salvation; it is a commandment of God, and it comes out of God's love for us. <s></s> &nbsp; <br /><br />So let's first look at how repentance helps us discover a fresh view about God. &nbsp; <br /><br />The scriptures tell us, "This is life eternal, that they might <em>know</em> thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a><em> </em>We come to know God and His Son as we draw closer to Them, and we draw closer to Them as we repent and change for the better. The very moment we kneel to pray and say "Father in Heaven," He is listening. &nbsp; <br /><br />Our prophets, past and present, have taught the following truths about our view of God: &nbsp; <br /><br />President Brigham Young spoke of the premortal existence when he said, "There is not a soul of you but what has lived in His house and dwelt with Him year after year, and yet you are (now) seeking to become acquainted with Him, when the fact is, you have merely forgotten what you did know."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />President Ezra Taft Benson added, "Nothing is going to startle us more when we pass through the veil to the other side than to realize how well we know our Father and how familiar His face is to us."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a><strong> </strong> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <br /><br />President Thomas S. Monson: "I am certain that we left our Heavenly Father with an overwhelming desire to return to Him."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> <s></s> &nbsp; <br /><br />God wants us to draw closer and again discover that "fresh view" of Him, but how does He do it? The Lord said, "If men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <br /><br />Elder Bruce C. Hafen said, "If you have problems in your life, don't assume there is something wrong with you. Struggling with those problems is at the very core of life's purpose. As we draw close to God, He will show us our weaknesses and through them make us wiser, stronger. If you're seeing more of your weaknesses, that just might mean you're moving nearer to God, not farther away."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />My friends, no matter how brilliant we think we are or how resilient we attempt to be, we cannot do it alone. God, through our Savior Jesus Christ, can make more out of us and our weaknesses than we ever could. It's not about us. We cannot get through this life on our own. <em>It's not about white knuckles. It's about bended knees</em>. It's about coming to a broken heart and contrite spirit. It's about the consistency of doing the simple things in our lives while we try each day to strengthen our faith in God. It's about daily prayer. It's reaching for our scriptures and reading and then pondering His words. It's about doing everything we can to invite the Spirit of the Holy Ghost into our lives, and it's about the constant courage to repent--creating a steady, mighty change of heart. It's about looking up. It's about seeking the higher ground and discovering a fresh view of God. &nbsp; <br /><br />Number two: Let's look at how repentance helps us discover a fresh view of one's self. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Holland said in this past conference, "Believe in yourself, and believe in Him."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> We can all relate to Nephi in 2 Nephi 4 as he experienced repentance. I choose to read phrases from verses 17 through 34. Listen for Nephi's change of heart:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">O wretched man that I am!... My heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.... <br />...My heart groaneth because of my sins.</p>
<p>Here's the turning point: "Nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted." Then turning to God and remembering, Nephi says,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions ... he hath preserved me.... <br />He hath filled me with his love.... <br />He hath confounded mine enemies.... <br />...[And] he hath heard my cry....<em></em> <br />Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.... <br />O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a></p>
<p>Nephi began his experience with the words "O wretched man that I am." He recognized his need for change. Each one of us has experienced that gnawing need to change and to repent of a thought, an action, or a habit, and it is painful. We think of ourselves at times as wretched. We may even delay repentance. Then we take that box called "repentance" off the shelf, open the lid, and look the contents straight in the eye. Then we, like Nephi, have that "nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted<em>" </em>moment, and we humbly seek the Lord's help.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />C. S. Lewis wrote <em>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</em>, a fantasy story for children. The story refers to Eustace, who hides in a dead dragon's cave to escape a sudden downpour. The dragon's treasure arouses his greed. He fills his pockets with gold and jewels, but as he sleeps, he is transformed into a dragon. As a dragon, he becomes aware of how bad his previous behavior was. He attempts to shed his dragon skin without success. It is only with the help of Aslan, the lion, who actually pulls off the thick, dark, knobbly-looking dragon skin, that he is able to become human again, though the process is painful. &nbsp; <br /><br />Eustace says, "The very first tear he made was so deep that I thought it had gone right into my heart. And when he began pulling the skin off, it hurt worse than anything I've ever felt. The only thing that made me able to bear it was just the pleasure of feeling the stuff peel off....&nbsp;And there was I--smooth and soft as a peeled switch and smaller than I had been."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Like Nephi in the Book of Mormon, and like Eustace in C. S. Lewis's fantasy, we experience, with the prodigal son, "coming to ourselves."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> We recognize the need for repentance, and we discover a fresh view about ourselves. Our potential is greater than we think. &nbsp; <br /><br />President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said, "God sent you here to prepare for a future greater than anything you can imagine."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />There is a famous Belgian artist by the name of Ren&eacute; Magritte. He painted a visual of himself seated before an easel with a paintbrush in his hand. He is looking to his left at a white egg sitting on a table, yet on the canvas in front of him, he is painting a large and beautiful bluebird with its wings outstretched. The painter in this painting sees more in the egg than meets the eye. He sees a great future and great potential. He does not just see the shell of an egg, but he sees the beautiful bird inside. Surely, God also sees in us great potential--much, much more than we could ever imagine! &nbsp; <br /><br />Someone once said, "Point your life in the right direction and prepare to be astonished!"<em> </em> <s>&nbsp;</s> <br /><br />Number three: How does repentance help us discover a fresh view of the world? &nbsp; <br /><br />President Thomas S. Monson said, "Today, we are encamped against the greatest array of sin, vice, and evil ever assembled before our eyes."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a> What's interesting is President Monson said that 50 years ago! I have watched as that wickedness has only increased. But we must not fear. We have the fulness of the gospel! The gift of the Holy Ghost allows us to discover a fresh "real" view about today's world and where we stand. And, I might add, living the gospel takes the fear out of living in the world.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <br /><br />I love Romans 12:2: "Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God." &nbsp; <br /><br />We do not need to conform to worldly ways. Elder Robert D. Hales tells us when we repent and are baptized, we come into God's kingdom. Then he said, "By choosing to be in His kingdom, we separate--not isolate--ourselves from the world."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Jerry Earl Johnston, a columnist for the <em>Deseret News</em>, recently wrote an article entitled "When People Call Me a Sheep, I Say Thank You." He makes reference to the latest label Mormons have received: that of "sheeple." He wrote, "Some are viewing Mormons as half-sheep, half-people. Mormons follow the leader. They go with the group. And in today's world, that means they're mindless." He goes on to explain, "We live in an era that salutes the individual.... [We are a] self-absorbed society." He continues,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Both the plural and the singular for "sheep" is "sheep." The animals are of one mind and heart. Perhaps the time will come," he wrote, "when people realize that thinking less of yourself doesn't make you less; it makes you more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Like raindrops falling in a lake, maybe we'll see that sacrificing individuality means becoming immense. <br /><br />Perhaps the day's coming when we'll know that losing ourselves is how we find ourselves.<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a></p>
<p>We are blessed to follow a leader, especially when that leader is a prophet of God, now President Thomas S. Monson. What the world does not understand is that President Monson is called of God. He holds all the priesthood keys on this earth and speaks to us for God Himself, to warn us and lead us in these latter days. &nbsp; <br /><br />An illustration of this truth was shared in a story told by President Harold B. Lee:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[A] traveler was leaving by boat from Stockholm, Sweden, traveling out into the Baltic Sea. To do so, the boat had to pass through a thousand or more islands. Standing on the forward deck, the traveler found himself becoming impatient because of what seemed to him to be a careless course. Why not a course near to this island or another and more interesting than the one the pilot had chosen? Almost in exasperation he was saying to himself, "What's wrong with the old pilot? Has he lost his sense of direction?" Suddenly he was aware of markers along the charted course that appeared as mere broom handles sticking up in the water. Someone had carefully explored these channels and had charted the safest course for ships to take.</p>
<p>President Lee continued,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So it is in life's course on the way to immortality and eternal life: "God's engineers," by following a blueprint made in heaven, have charted the course for safest and happiest passage and have forewarned us of the danger areas.<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a></p>
<p>When we follow the prophet, our course will lead us safely back home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If we are going to make a difference in this world, we must be different. We must be constantly progressing, repenting, and drawing closer to the Lord to discover a fresh "real" view of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My friends, today we have talked about discovering a fresh view about God, about one's self, and about the world. I hope you have discovered that <em>that fresh view is within you</em>. Let your heart constantly change for the better with the help of our Savior Jesus Christ. Like the little green plant, you are emerging through the asphalt, and God is helping you prepare for a future greater than you can imagine. <br /><br /> <img alt="Plant growing from asphalt" height="250" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring%202017/Graphics/Plant-from-the-asphalt_300x250.jpg" width="300" /> <br /><br />I challenge you to strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ and make the time to define all that is good about this magnificent gospel of Jesus Christ. Live it, breathe it, courageously defend it, and speak freely of it. Like my friend Doug speaking to his friend, we can discover a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world and share it comfortably with others--for all to see the view is breathtaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I close with these words from Peter in the book of Acts: "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord."<a href="/devotionals/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a> That time of refreshing is the current Restoration, and it is unfolding right now. This is the last dispensation, the dispensation of the fulness of times, and we are all blessed to view it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify of the reality of our Father in Heaven, of His Son Jesus Christ, and the power of the Holy Ghost. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true Church on this earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /> &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Former Primary General President</p>
<p>Sister Rosemary M. Wixom served for six years as the 12th general president of the Primary.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was released in April General Conference of 2016.&nbsp; She has served on the Primary general board, the Young Women general board, and with her husband as he served as president of the Washington D.C. South Mission.<br /><br />She was raised in Salt Lake City and attended Utah State University, where she graduated in elementary education. She and her husband, B. Jackson Wixom, are the parents of six children and have sixteen grandchildren.<br /><br />Sister Wixom is drawn to the scripture, "Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come" (D&amp;C 68:6).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here we are tonight sitting side by side (wherever you are), gathering strength from the Spirit of the Holy Ghost and from each other. I believe our Heavenly Father is very much aware of us, his daughters, here tonight. His love for us is evidenced in that fact that He gave His Only Begotten Son so that we could return to Him. I believe He would say to us, if He were here<em>, </em>"I gave you my Son--use Him." He wants us to turn to Him with every need. Nothing is unimportant to our Father if it is important to us. God wants us to come to know Him and His Son, Jesus Christ, for "this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>We knew God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ in the premortal existence, yet we stepped through the veil, and now we are trying to relearn what we once knew. This earth life is actually a very short time in the perspective of eternity. The Apostle James asked, "For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> We must make good use of our present time on earth to come to know our Father and His Son again. No wonder we hear in the sacrament prayer each week, "that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember Him."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> For President Ezra Taft Benson said, "Nothing is going to startle us more when we pass through the veil to the other side than to realize how well we know our Father and how familiar His face is to us."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> I pray tonight that we may remember Him and feel an abundance of His love. &nbsp; <br /><br />It's interesting--as women of the Church, we may not know each other's hearts, but we do feel empathy for one another. We may not know each other's burdens, but we know we all carry them--so we gather together at times like this, giving glances of hope. &nbsp; <br /><br />In Acts 4 we read, "And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> I believe the Quaker proverb "Thee lift me and me lift thee, and together we'll ascend to heaven"<em> </em>could be an unspoken truth among the women of the Church. Our lives are different, our ages different, our circumstances and languages are different, yet we share a common goal--that of eternal life, where we can again live in God's presence. And with that "unspoken truth," we link arms, and we are all about helping each other get there. &nbsp; <br /><br />Hence the title of my message tonight: "Live in the Present, but Keep Your Eye on Eternity." &nbsp; <br /><br />As we live in the present (each one of us in our cubby holes of life), we must keep our eyes on eternal life. Elder Bruce C. Hafen said, "We can have eternal life if we want it, but only if there is nothing else we want more."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> So, tonight, let's put our heads together and explore how we can better do just that. &nbsp; <br /><br />Think about what is your present focus in life. Ask yourself these questions: "What is my main purpose each day?" or "If my life were a book, what would be the title?" The answer to these questions will help you define your "present." Do you have it? Now, with your focus in mind, ask, "How do I make sure I see eternity each day?" &nbsp; <br /><br />I would like you to turn to the sister next to you or a little group of you and discuss that very question: "How do I see eternity in my life each day?" &nbsp; <br /><br />[AUDIENCE DISCUSSION] &nbsp; <br /><br />I need two volunteers--the first one up to come over this way and one to come over this way--to share with us what you just learned. Will you tell us your name first? &nbsp; <br /><br />NAGATA: Candace Nagata. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: Candace, thank you for coming. And what's your station in life? What's your season in life? &nbsp; <br /><br />NAGATA: I am a mother of five children, and I get to serve in our Relief Society presidency. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: Lucky you. And you have beautiful blue eyes. &nbsp; <br /><br />NAGATA: Thank you. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: How do you daily focus on eternity? &nbsp; <br /><br />NAGATA: I had mentioned making sure to make the time in our busy schedules to find some quiet, to be able to pray to our Heavenly Father and listen and to take time to study our scriptures. And in my cute gathering of women, they had wonderful ideas too about recognizing the tender mercies of the Lord throughout your day and His hand in your life. And another sister mentioned the technology that she carries within her hand and the opportunity, wherever she is, if she has a quiet moment, to look for some inspiration in a church talk or in some scriptures just within the technology she carries. And I thought those were great ideas. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: They <em>are </em>great ideas, and you are great. Thank you so much for sharing. You see, you didn't need me. The real wealth is right there, sitting next to you. &nbsp; <br /><br />Tell us your name. &nbsp; <br /><br />ROBBINS: Carol Robbins. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: Carol, what's your season of life? &nbsp; <br /><br />ROBBINS: Three kids and a newborn. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: Thank you for coming tonight. Tell us, how do you focus on eternity? &nbsp; <br /><br />ROBBINS: I can't take credit for this one; the woman that I turned to told me this. This station of life is cleaning, laundry, dishes, vacuuming, keeping the kids clean all day long. And I asked her, how do I keep the eternal perspective? How is this preparing me for eternity? And she said it's how we go about that day, how we treat our kids, how we treat our husband. And that's when the light clicked. That's right. We can do those things and not feel guilty. It's how we go about doing it. &nbsp; <br /><br />WIXOM: It's not what we do; it's how we do it. You're beautiful. Thank you, Carol. &nbsp; <br /><br />President Monson said, "Moments of clarity come to all of us one time or another ... and we see clearly what really matters in our lives."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a><em></em> &nbsp; <br /><br />So let's begin with the question "How I do I find the <em>time</em> in my 'present' life to discover clarity to see eternity?"<strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <br /><br />Anne Morrow Linbergh's book <em>Gift from the Sea</em> is a favorite book of mine. If you can't go to the beach and rediscover yourself like she did, at least you can read her book. She said, "We choke the space [of our lives] with continuous music, chatter, and companionship," and I might add social media, "to which we do not even listen. It is simply there to fill the vacuum. When the noise stops there is no inner music to take its place. We must re-learn to be alone.... There is a quality to being alone that is incredibly precious. Life rushes back into the void richer, more vivid, fuller than before."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Have you discovered the peace you can feel when you are alone, when the world is quiet and your thoughts explore into the corners of your mind, when you can quietly pray and talk to God and <em>then</em> take the time to listen for His response? Jeremiah teaches us there is rest for those who quietly walk with God. He said, "Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk [walk with God] therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> "Be still, and know that I am God"<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> <em>&nbsp;</em> <br /><br />These thoughts take us to the theme of "sacred idleness." Boyd Matheson wrote an article entitled "'Sacred Idleness' Is a Balm for Weariness"<strong> </strong>in the newspaper. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We can become weary by attempting to do too much, trying to please everyone, ... holding a grudge, being in a hurry, needlessly worrying, being forever tethered to technology and even by not being clear about what really matters.... &nbsp; <br /><br />Sacred idleness is <em>not</em> about escaping reality, mindlessly watching TV, sleeping late, surfing social media, or justification for doing whatever feels good. &nbsp; <br /><br />Rather, it is a focus on sacred things that renew, rejuvenate and restore. The word "sacred" does not necessarily equate to things related to religion or spirituality.... It is important to note that the word sacred is also defined as something highly valued, something set aside or even set apart, for a specific purpose.... &nbsp; <br /><br />In the New Testament, Christ taught his apostles this important principle of sacred idleness and rest. In Mark 6:30-32: "And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught. &nbsp; <br /><br />"And he said unto them, come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while."</p>
<p>Mr. Matheson said, "Christ was giving the apostles a chance to have a moment of sacred idleness.... He was not taking them on a weekend spa retreat. My guess is that there was a lot of work and study out there in the desert."<em></em> <br /><br />For you young mothers, Elder Neal A. Maxwell: "We rest and have some solitude in order to better serve those who may contribute to our fatigue." &nbsp; <br /><br />Mr. Matheson said when the Lord said to his disciples "peace, be still" while they were on the raging sea and about to perish, perhaps "the Savior was not really speaking to the wind and the waves! [Perhaps he] was speaking to his disciples."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the end, sacred idleness is about pursuing small moments that matter. It is making time for yourself, and those you care about, to do things that are important, rejuvenating and set aside for your purposes. Activities that give you energy back are sacred.... [Listening to inspiring music], ... breathing deeply, writing, [reading the scriptures, prayer] or simply forcing yourself to be still. Amazingly, sacred idleness can also be found in serving others, meaningful dialogue, reaching out or simply looking within.<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Matheson's article spoke to me. Focusing on those "small moments that matter" is what allows us to live in the present while we keep our eye on eternity. I smile when I think of you and the busy lives you lead. Whether you are immersed in study, work, motherhood, grandmotherhood, or a combination of the above, you are living your life at full throttle, and I salute you. Each one of you is His precious daughter, and our Father and His Son hover to help on this path back to them. &nbsp; <br /><br />Another question: How do we take control of our present lives? We know, here on earth, we are laying up for ourselves treasures in heaven. The adversary wants us to keep busily engaged in a multitude of trivial things in an effort to keep us distracted from a few treasured vital things. &nbsp; <br /><br />Here is the clue: Seek God's light, seek His will, and decide, what are the big things in life? What is essential? Then all else pales in that perspective. When we focus on what is essential, confusion dissolves, and we are not vulnerable to blowing in the wind. We must be cautious to not take our validation, what we think about ourselves, from a horizontal perspective by comparing ourselves to others. Immersing ourselves in social media like Instagram and Facebook can take the wind out of our sails. Rather, we must take our validation vertically, from God. The question we ask is <em>not</em> "What will others think?" but "What will God think?"<em> </em>Then we put our energy and focus in <em>His</em> direction. &nbsp; <br /><br />Sisters, the treasures here on earth that will allow us to lay up treasures in heaven are the covenants we make with God. That is what is essential, and we cannot be casual about living them. Our covenants are our day-to-day willingness to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">bear one another's burdens, that they may be light; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />... [To] mourn with those that mourn; ... and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a></p>
<p>And listen to this: "Our covenants are our willingness to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, which means to see ourselves as His is a priceless treasure. We put Him and His work first in our lives. We seek what He wants rather than what we want or what the world teaches us to want."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />These covenants are at the very heart of our earth-life experience. Every decision we make should be made with those promises in mind, and we should not expect it to be easy. This "present life" was not meant to be easy. We are covenant-making women, and we are strong. We can see bits of heaven here on earth, <em>and</em> we want heaven in the future in the form of eternal life with God. The world may not see the beauty of that truth. But Elizabeth Barrett Browning did when she wrote the poem we all love:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Earth's crammed with heaven,<br /> And every common bush afire with God,<br /> But only he who sees takes off his shoes;<br /> The rest sit round it and pluck blackberries.</p>
<p>The world is just beginning to see the power and influence of covenant women and men on this earth. We know that when we let these sacred promises drive our focus in life, it will lighten our burdens and prioritize our decisions. There is an abundance of a feeling of "pure peace" that comes with living our covenants. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now, does this mean that all fun, fashion, yummy food, and spontaneity go out the window? Of course not, but these things are incidental to our real purpose in life. Like the pioneers, their destination was Zion, yet among the intense hardships along the way, there was always music, dancing, and laughter. They gathered strength from each other, and their joy was doing it together. If we as "Mormons" can't have fun--crazy fun--on our journey, we are missing a piece of joy, for "men are that they might have joy."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> So we enhance our lives with our creativity while we seek Him and keep the covenants. I love that plan! &nbsp; <br /><br />No wonder a good friend of mine, when his aged father was about to pass away, said his father's last words were "Keep your covenants to bless your family." &nbsp; <br /><br />Each one of us in this room has a story, a story of faith and humble effort to keep the covenants we have made. We are not perfect, even though we would like others to perceive we are. Covenant keeping is about trying, sometimes failing, but getting up and trying again. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Neal A. Maxwell described this path we are on when he said, "Our perfect Father does not expect us to be perfect children. He had only one such Child. Therefore, sometimes with smudges on our cheeks, dirt on our hands and shoes untied, stammeringly, but smiling we present God with a dandelion--as if it were an orchid or a rose! If for now the dandelions the best we have to offer, He receives it knowing what we may later place on the altar. It is good to remember how young we are spiritually."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a> Thank you, Elder Maxwell! &nbsp; <br /><br />Living this gospel is all about progressing--becoming while focusing on eternity--with an eye single to His glory. &nbsp; <br /><br />May I share with you the stories of three women, Patricia, Aurelia, and Joanie? They, like you and me, were trying with the Lord's help to keep the covenants they had made. &nbsp; <br /><br />When Patricia Pinegar, a past general Primary president, was a young mother of four children, she loved light, order, and calm feelings. She said, "I always wanted the floors to be clean to help contribute to that feeling of calm, but it was difficult to do with toddlers. As a result, I vacuumed a lot."<em> </em>One day her husband, Ed, came home early and she was vacuuming. He gave her a big hug and then jokingly said, "I know what you'll be doing in the eternities--you'll be the chief vacuumer."<em> </em>She said, "I knew he was kidding, but my life felt out of control. I thought, NO!" The next day, she got a babysitter, took a stack of paper and her scriptures, and went fasting to her parents' cabin in the mountains. She spent the day sorting out her life and taking control. She prayed, wrote pages of lists, and prioritized everything. She defined that returning to her Heavenly Father with Ed, her husband, and her children was top priority. The promises she had made on this covenant path were most important. The things that came next were those things that would help her get there, such as scripture study, temple attendance, family home evening, and teaching their children. Cleaning the drawers in the bathroom fell to the bottom of her list. Then, as an exercise in returning to faith and values, she drew up a plan and overlaid her list on the calendar so things would happen. This was a monumental time in her life. She went home excited because she knew where she wanted to go. &nbsp; <br /><br />She shared her experience with Ed, and he willingly went through the same priority-setting exercise with Patricia. She said, "This was a wonderful turning point in our marriage. We talked weekly about our goals and attended the temple regularly, with a focus on each of our children.<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Now, we may not have access to a cabin in the woods or even a full day where we can escape our daily life, but we do have access to prayer, fasting, our scriptures, and a notepad of paper. Time spent seeking personal revelation for ourselves and our family with an eternal perspective is time well spent. &nbsp; <br /><br />I recently asked a friend who is serving in Primary, "What have you learned from this experience of serving in Primary?" Her response surprised me; it was most interesting. She said, "I have learned the importance and the blessing of truly loving my husband." Then she explained, "For when I love my husband and try to live the covenants, my love increases for everyone, especially for the children in Primary, and it affects every part of my life." &nbsp; <br /><br />Next, I would love for you to meet Aurelia, in San Pablo, in the Philippines. Aurelia was petite, with dark eyes and black hair simply cut in a dutch cut. She hesitated to smile because she had so few teeth in her mouth, but her countenance radiated. Her home was at the top of a hill in a clearing in a grove of mahogany trees. She was a widow with 10 children. Six of her children were married. One son recently had returned home from a mission. He had walked up that same path we had walked earlier that day, through the mahogany trees, to get to the clearing he called home. Her two daughters were young women in the branch. They were dressed modestly and beautiful. Little Joseph, age eight, was the youngest, a good student and helpful to his mother. Her family's home consisted of plywood boards framing the single-room structure. Their family mainly existed outdoors with wooden benches for chairs and chickens roaming free. They had to go a distance for water, using the big plastic water jugs they stored in the clearing. Like all of us, Aurelia asked herself, "What matters most?" What do I want my children to hold on to? By her actions she answered: the gospel of Jesus Christ and the sacred covenants we revere. She was teaching her children about baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost and the blessing of the sacrament each week and what they could do each day to live their covenants. She would gather her family for family prayer. The strength of priesthood power existed in her home because of temple covenants she has made with her husband, and she continues to keep even after his death. She was intentionally teaching her children to trust and obey Jesus Christ. Her children watched her deal with the daily crisis of life while they truly held on to each other. &nbsp; <br /><br />After standing in that clearing--I call it "sacred ground"--and sharing a family prayer and singing the Primary song "Families Can Be Together Forever," we prepared to say goodbye. I bent down to pick up my small purse I had placed on a tree stump. There, curled up on my bag, was a kitten. As I looked down, I glanced at Aurelia's feet. She was wearing plastic flip-flops like many Filipinos, and I noticed her toenails were painted bright red. I smiled. She was, like you and me, still a woman who, amidst her circumstances of simplicity, had found an ounce of joy in nail polish. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now, let me tell you about Joanie. On January 27, 2016, Joanie Daily passed away from breast cancer. It seems appropriate that I would speak about her today. She was a beautiful, vibrant 57-year-old woman. Healthy and energetic, she ran over 20 marathons in her life. A devoted wife, faithful mother to four handsome boys, a grandmother to three precious grandchildren, and a high school teacher. Joanie and I share those three grandchildren. In fact, Maggie, age eight at the time, loved her grandma Joanie so much she asked her mother if she could speak at her grandma Joanie's funeral. Maggie did so well. It was tender. If you had driven by Skyline High School that week, you would have seen the pink ribbons tied to trees, lampposts, and road signs for blocks surrounding the school. Joanie had influenced thousands of students with her service-oriented Community of Caring Class at Skyline. She lived in the present. Her life was about serving others. It began with her family, church, and then community. &nbsp; <br /><br />Just days before she passed away, Joanie reflected on her life. She experienced the moment President Monson must have meant when he referred to those "moments of clarity [that] come to all of us at one time or another ... [and we see what] really matters in our lives."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Joanie wrote, "I have come to realize a few qualities and activities that have enriched my life and that matter most to me. I would like to share them with you." &nbsp; <br /><br />Here are the 10 things she wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spend time with family. Nothing is more important. <br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Testimony of the gospel. Don't let the philosophies of men influence you. Embrace the spiritual.<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prayer is sacred.<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scripture study--make time to read and study these sacred works.<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never forget you are a daughter of God. Reach up. He will always take your hand.<br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temple attendance, temple covenants, and temple work for our ancestors. This has blessed my life immensely.<br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be honest with each other. I have trifled with silly things at times and have been grateful for a friend's advice.<br />8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue serving individually and collectively. Service blesses both the giver and the receiver. I love to serve!<br />9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep getting outside in nature and enjoying the beauty of the Creation.<br />10. Continue to be respectful and non-judging. Be kind!</p>
<p>If you were to write the qualities and activities that have enriched your present life and that matter most to you, what would you write? &nbsp; <br /><br />We can "lift up [our hearts] and rejoice, and cleave unto [our] covenants,"<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a> as the Lord told Emma Smith. We can, like Paul says, "Fight the good fight of faith, [and] lay hold on eternal life"<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a> Our covenants are a gift from our Heavenly Father--our Father we have known from before this life. Nephi saw our day when he said, "I ... beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the <em>covenant people</em> of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory."<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />We are not alone, and the Lord does not want us to do "this present life" all by ourselves. As we get up each morning and begin our day, He is hovering nearby, waiting for the moment we connect with Him in prayer, and He "will go before your face ... and be on your right hand and on your left"<a href="/speeches/sister-rosemary-m-wixom#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</a> throughout your day. How do I know that? &nbsp; <br /><br />In October of 2015, at the conclusion of a General Authority meeting, President Henry B. Eyring spoke to the brothers and sisters in the room. This is what I wrote in my personal journal. "President Eyring said, 'Here we are talking about the programs of the Church. Heavenly Father and His Son, I think, are aware of us today. I think they are smiling. They see we are trying.' President Eyring said, 'I think I got the message from them. They are saying, "We would like to help them if they would allow us."' Let me repeat that. President Eyring said, 'Our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, were saying, "We would like to help them if they would allow us.'" Can you feel the love in those words? &nbsp; <br /><br />We can allow them to help us by staying close to them in prayer and keeping our covenants as we live in the present each day but keep our eye on eternity. &nbsp; <br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>A couple of semesters ago, I learned about two experiences from the history of our campus that have inspired me to speak on the subject I have chosen for today. While the first is from a little more distant history and the second is much more recent, I hope both will help us ponder where we stand individually in relation to the theme of my address.<br /><br /> While teaching a course on the Presidents of the Church, I learned more about President Harold B.

<p>President Lee came here in the midst of the infamous Watergate scandal involving United States president Richard M. Nixon. While the full details had not yet come to light, President Lee described the time as one of "great crisis" and observed that this nation was being "torn with scandal and with criticism, with faultfinding and condemnation." He warned those on this campus not to engage in behavior that would strike "at the underpinnings of one of the greatest of all nations of all the world." Rather he powerfully encouraged students and faculty in that turbulent time to "be on the optimistic side" and to be part of the "dynamic force that will help turn the tide of fear and pessimism."<a href="/devotionals/ryan-gardner#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> I almost thought we could spend this entire devotional just talking about how relevant his counsel <em>then</em> is for our current political climate <em>now</em>, but I'll leave you to learn more about that on your own, if you're interested.<br /><br /> On that occasion over 43 years ago, the students of Ricks College presented a plaque to President Lee on which was inscribed a special tribute composed by a committee of students. Part of that tribute contained these words: "As sons and daughters of the living God, we <em>stand united in tribute to the living prophet</em>.... Thanks be to God that we live in a prophet's time, when his inspired leadership draws us closer to standing in those Holy Places where we prayerfully await Christ's second coming."<a href="/devotionals/ryan-gardner#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> Today, I invite us to ponder what it means to "stand united in tribute to the living prophet." I hope we will consider the degree to which we are living up to that commitment, as a campus community and in our individual lives.<br /><br /> The second experience that inspired me to speak on this subject comes from a former student in one of my classes. With his permission, I share some of his observations regarding some BYU-Idaho students who have not chosen to "stand united in tribute to the living prophet." Although my friend began attending BYU-Idaho in 2008, for financial reasons he soon had to leave school to provide for his family. During that time, he worked long hours at a very demanding job, stayed active in the Church, magnified his callings, and was diligently striving to follow the teachings of the living prophets. Through those years, he observed the following: <br /><br /> "I would follow friends [from BYU-Idaho] on Facebook and watch ... as they were able to finish their degree and go on to their desired career fields. Then I saw something else happen. Many of them ... after leaving this cradle of the gospel at BYU-Idaho, would start to wander. I watched as they started to make posts online or comments in conversations regarding their opposition to some of the statements put out by the First Presidency. They would always reference the more complex issues pressing us today. I could literally watch as my brothers and sisters that I knew here at BYU-I, who [were active and] legitimately and truthfully happy, let their testimonies decay and rot.... [T]hey allowed their own finite, misled though well intended, personal opinions [to] blind them to the divinity of the calling of the Prophet. As this would happen I would see them become negative, spiteful, and angry, [always seeking other sources to justify] their own erroneous way of thinking and why the Prophet, the very mouthpiece of Jehovah, was incorrect, outdated, or discriminatory...."<br /><br /> He then shared the following about his experience returning to this campus seven years later to finish his degree: "I see the same people I saw before, just with different faces. I have heard these young [students] make comments that are the seeds of apostasy.... I ... want to beg and plead with them to hold tight to the Iron Rod, which is not just the Book of Mormon, but every word of God spoken by the mouth of His prophets....<br /><br /> "It can be hard to see a Prophet [who] was raised in a different era and truly believe that he can grasp the issues at hand today; but he does, more than we do. Well it would be with us to take into consideration the commandment 'Seek not to counsel your God' (D&amp;C 22:4) and to 'murmur not because of the things which [we have] not seen' (D&amp;C 25:4)."<a href="/devotionals/ryan-gardner#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a><br /><br /> I share this student's experience to again invite each of us to consider our current commitment to "stand united in tribute to the living prophet." As this student has observed, our choices about whether we choose to sustain the living prophet now will have sure consequences for our future faithfulness and happiness.<br /><br /> Why does God use prophets to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ to His children? In Moses 5:58, we learn that "the Gospel began to be preached, from the beginning, being declared <em>by holy angels</em> sent forth from the presence of God, and <em>by his own voice</em>, and <em>by the gift of the Holy Ghost</em>" (emphasis added). These seem like three pretty solid modes of communication: angels, the voice of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. We might wonder why God would use any other means to declare the way of salvation to mankind. But in Moses 6, we read that, beginning with Adam, Heavenly Father also called upon men who "hearkened unto the voice of God" and commissioned them to teach others. These men became "preachers of righteousness, and spake and prophesied, and called upon all men, everywhere, to repent," and thus "faith was taught unto the children of men" (see Moses 6:1-23). Angels have occasionally been sent to deliver divine messages; sometimes God has spoken from the heavens in an audible voice; and the gift of the Holy Ghost is available to all those who exercise faith in Jesus Christ, repent of their sins, and make and keep the covenant of baptism "with full purpose of heart" (2 Nephi 31:13). However, from Adam's time to our time, the most common and widespread means for conveying the truths of salvation to His children has been for God to call a prophet. As you watch the following video, I invite you to think about why this might be the case: <br /><br /> We might well ask: Wouldn't it be more persuasive to send an angel from heaven to everyone? Or, wouldn't it be more powerful for each person to hear the actual voice of God? Or, wouldn't it be better if each of us just listened to the Holy Ghost for ourselves? I have my own thoughts about why God chooses to use prophets even though these other three modes of communication are available to Him. But rather than tell you what I think, will you please turn to someone sitting next to you and discuss together for a moment why you think God uses prophets so consistently to teach the gospel to the world.<br /><br /> Through study and experience, I have come to see the wisdom of God in using prophets to teach and lead His children on the earth. All ancient and modern scripture now available to us confirms this pattern-over and over and over again. Let us turn to the scriptures and review one of my favorite experiences that I hope will strengthen our resolve to "stand united in tribute to the living prophet." Although Paul was not the President of the Church in his day, this scriptural account illustrates (1) the reality of the gift of prophecy and seership, (2) some common obstacles we face in following prophets, (3) the faith it takes to follow the Lord's servants amidst treacherous circumstances, and (4) the blessings of safety and protection that come into our lives as we follow the Lord's servants.<br /><br /> In Acts 27, we read that Paul was being escorted by a Roman centurion named Julius to stand trial before the Roman emperor. The first part of their journey by sea progressed very slowly. By the time they arrived at a harbor called "the fair havens," the ideal season for sea travel had passed, and the scriptural account reports that "sailing was now dangerous." At this point, Paul, as an Apostle with prophetic gifts, warned, "Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the [cargo], but also of our lives." That sounds like a pretty ominous warning worth serious consideration!<br /><br /> In the response of Julius and the crew, I believe we can see three reasons people commonly have difficulty heeding prophetic voices. First, "the centurion believed the master and owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul." Before we condemn Julius too harshly, remember that the scriptures say Paul was a tentmaker (see Acts 18:3). Whom would you believe: a sea-hardened, experienced sailor or a land-loving tentmaker? In the world today, experts with earthly credentials are often viewed as more reliable sources of counsel and direction than prophets, whose spiritual gifts are unseen and require faith to accept. But let us remember what President Ezra Taft Benson said: "The prophet is not required to have any particular earthly training or credentials to speak on any subject or act on any matter at any time.... We encourage earthly knowledge in many areas, but remember, if there is ever a conflict between earthly knowledge and the words of the prophet, you stand with the prophet, and you'll be blessed and time will vindicate you."<a href="/devotionals/ryan-gardner#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> A second reason Paul's counsel may have been rejected by some was "because the haven was not commodious to winter in." The place on the southern coast of Crete most commonly associated with "the fair havens" is not what most people would call "pretty."<a href="/devotionals/ryan-gardner#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> It looks kind of like where I grew up in southern Wyoming, but with a shoreline. I can understand why some of the sailors may have felt the place was misnamed! Obeying Paul's direction on this occasion was viewed as uncomfortable, inconvenient, and just plain not very fun. Prophetic instruction is seldom about our comfort, convenience, or entertainment but always designed to bring us ultimate safety, peace, and joy. The final reason Paul's counsel fell on deaf ears was because "the more part advised to depart thence also." I don't know if they actually took a vote or held an open debate, but Paul's one prophetic vote apparently didn't count for much against the vote of the crowd. Again, we may want to recall an observation from President Benson: "Popularity is never a test of truth. Many a prophet has been killed or cast out [or, as in this case, voted down]. As we come closer to the Lord's second coming, you can expect that as the people of the world become more wicked, the prophet will be less popular with them."<a href="/devotionals/ryan-gardner#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> If we are not careful today, the prophetic voice can be drowned out by the myriad voices of various scholarly, scientific, or political crowds. In the face of these objections, Paul's prophetic warning was discarded, and the group resumed their voyage.<br /><br /> Some people might think this story would teach a more powerful lesson if they had barely left the harbor when the ship struck ground and sank and everyone drowned-but that wasn't what happened at all. In fact, the record states, "And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete." In other words, at first everything seemed to go along quite nicely-even better than expected! I can imagine Julius and the ship's captain, or perhaps some of the crew, standing on deck and chuckling toward Paul and his associates, muttering under their breath, "Stupid tentmaker..." Most often, brothers and sisters, there are not immediate consequences for rejecting the counsel of prophets. People who date before they're 16 don't spontaneously burst into flames; those who get body piercings and tattoos don't die from infectious diseases contracted from the needles; and the sky doesn't come crashing down, nor does civilization immediately dissolve because same-gender marriage becomes legal. However, what happens to the passengers during Paul's voyage will just as surely happen to all those who reject the counsel of living prophets-sooner or later.<br /><br /> "Not long after," the scriptures continue, "there arose against [the ship] a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon." <em>Euroclydon</em> is a Greek word indicating a "violent agitation"-a typhoon, in today's terminology. Those who ignore, neglect, scoff at, or reject the words of prophets in their midst may think that things are still smooth sailing, but sooner or later-Euroclydon! Every time! This storm was so terrible that eventually the crew and captain lost control of the ship and "let her drive." That too has a parallel in our lives. When we refuse to heed prophetic warnings, we will eventually come to the frightening realization that we are no longer in control or have the power to steer our lives where we would like to go. For three days the ship was at the mercy of the storm, cargo and tackling were tossed overboard to lighten the load, and when "neither sun nor stars in many days appeared ... all hope that [they] should be saved was then taken away."<br /><br /> Just in that moment of great despair, Paul offered a prophetic rebuke and message of hope: "Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss." That's a little bit of an apostolic I-told-you-so, but here comes the hopeful part: "Be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship ... howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island." While this may not have been terribly comforting to the ship's owner, at least the group was being assured that no one was going to die. It is interesting to note that just as disobedience did not bring immediate punishment, things did not immediately get better after Paul's promise either. Several more uncertain and stormy days passed before their depth-testing tactics revealed that they were nearing land, just as Paul had foretold. However, their willingness to stand united with a living prophet was about to be put to the extreme test.<br /><br /> The relief that they were approaching a shoreline soon turned to alarm as they discovered that the bottom of the ocean was coming up toward them more quickly than they could stop! Fearing that the ship would be dashed upon the rocks by the still-raging wind and waves, they cast four anchors out of the back of the boat to slow it down and hoped for daylight. But this didn't seem to help, and soon they were all heading for the lifeboat to abandon ship. This makes a lot of sense from a rational standpoint. Paul said the ship would be destroyed, so if you want to survive, it makes sense to get off the doomed vessel as quickly as possible. Now, I don't know if there were enough seats in the lifeboat for all 276 people on board, but I kind of doubt it. Prisoners and servants in the Roman culture were not valued very highly, so there was probably only enough room in the lifeboat for the Roman guards, the captain, and the crew. Just then came the ultimate test of whether this band of struggling voyagers would stand <em>united</em> with a living prophet. Paul instructed them, "Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved." What? If you want to live, you have to stay in a boat that you've been told is going to be destroyed? That doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense, does it? But something has happened in the hearts of these men: <em>they have learned to trust Paul, a prophet</em>. So the scripture tells us they did something completely amazing, a sure sign that they were going to stand <em>united</em> with a living prophet: "The soldiers cut off the ropes of the [life]boat, and let her fall off." This is what it looks like to be "all in" when it comes to standing with a living prophet. This is what total commitment and faith look like. They were completely willing to do what Paul said rather than listen to experts or look for what might be convenient or do what the majority thought made sense.<br /><br /> After this remarkable demonstration of faith, Paul told them to get something to eat, assured them again that no one would die, and prayed with them. Then something happened that can only happen for those who <em>know</em> that they are following the Lord's servants and are doing what He has ordained for their safety and security. The record says, "Then were they all of good cheer." There they were in the middle of a life-threatening storm, on a boat that was likely to end up on the bottom of the sea, with no way to escape-and they all seemed to be feeling pretty good about the whole situation! That may sound crazy to the world's way of thinking, but that is the peace that comes to those who know they are following the Savior by heeding His servants. <br /><br /> Just around daybreak, they discovered a creek coming out from the island that they could drive the ship into so they could make it as close to land as possible. They took up the anchors, hoisted up the main sail, and headed full-speed for shore. Running the ship aground, the forepart of the ship stuck fast, and the violent waves tore off the rear part of the boat. They knew they were close enough to land that they could now swim or float ashore on the broken boards from the ship. True to their professional code, some of the guards proposed killing their prisoners so none would escape. But Julius, "willing to save Paul," thwarted this traditional solution. He knew by now exactly how valuable a true prophet and Apostle was! So they cast themselves into the sea, some swimming and some on boards, and the account concludes, "They escaped <em>all</em> safe to land"-all 276 of them, because they stood <em>united</em> with a living prophet.<br /><br /> The early Saints in this dispensation were also tested repeatedly to see if they would stand united with the Prophet Joseph Smith. As they were forced to flee New York, Ohio, and then Missouri, surely they relied on their testimonies that God was indeed leading them through a living prophet during their own tumultuous circumstances. As the Saints began regrouping and regathering in Illinois in August 1840, the First Presidency of the Church composed an address to all the Saints, wherever they might be. I now quote from that address to illustrate the first of two compelling reasons we need to stand united with the living prophet in our day:<br /><br /> "The work which has to be accomplished in the last days is one of vast importance, and will call into action the energy, skill, talent, and ability of the Saints, so that it may roll forth with that glory and majesty described by the prophet; and will consequently require the concentration of the Saints to accomplish works of such magnitude and grandeur....<br /><br /> "...Feeling desirous to carry out the purposes of God to which work we have been called; and to be co-workers with Him in this last dispensation; we feel the necessity of having the hearty cooperation of the Saints throughout this land, and upon the islands of the sea. It will be necessary for the Saints to hearken to counsel and ... lay aside every selfish principle ... and assist to the utmost of their power, those to whom has been given the pattern and the design. Like those who held up the hands of Moses, so let us hold up the hands of those who are appointed to direct the affairs of the Kingdom, so that they may be strengthened ... and be instrumental in effecting the great work of the last days."<a href="/devotionals/ryan-gardner#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a><br /><br /> Thus, the first compelling reason for us to be united with the living prophet is so the Church collectively can accomplish its divinely appointed work and mission in this dispensation. Each of us has been sent to the earth at this time to contribute to the building of Zion and fulfilling the Father's work in this dispensation. Elder D. Todd Christofferson invited us to ponder the following: "As we consider the unity required for Zion to flourish, we should ask ourselves if we have overcome jarrings, contentions, envyings, and strifes (see D&amp;C 101:6). Are we individually and as a people free from strife and contention and united 'according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom'? (D&amp;C 105:4)....<br /><br /> "We will become of one heart and one mind as we individually place the Savior at the center of our lives <em>and follow those He has commissioned to lead us.</em>"<a href="/devotionals/ryan-gardner#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> Only by following the President of the Church, who holds the keys for the establishment of Zion (see D&amp;C 21:1-8; 28:6-9), will we be able to build Zion on the earth in preparation for the return of the Savior.<br /><br /> Are we "[assisting] to the utmost of [our] power" those whom the Lord has charged with guiding both the "momentum and direction" of this great work?<a href="/devotionals/ryan-gardner#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> I hope that none of us will ever do anything in our friendships, in our families, in our congregations, or in our communities that would detract from or interfere with the work of the Lord that is being led by prophets, seers, and revelators.<br /><br /> The second pressing reason we need to stand united with the living prophet has to do with our individual spiritual progression. President James E. Faust affirmed the importance of being personally aligned with the living prophet: "I have concluded that spiritual guidance in large measure depends upon being in harmony with the President of the Church, the First Presidency, and the Quorum of the Twelve-all of whom are sustained ... as prophets, seers, and revelators. I do not know how we can expect to be in full harmony with the Spirit of the Lord if we are not in harmony with the President of the Church and the other prophets, seers, and revelators."<a href="/devotionals/ryan-gardner#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> The more we are aligned with the living prophet of God and the inspired revelations given through him to the Church, the more clear and reliable will be our own personal revelation through the gift of the Holy Ghost. This is critical to our individual spiritual survival in the last days, since the Lord has declared that only those who "have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived ... shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day" (D&amp;C 45:57).<br /><br /> Remember the special musical number sung by the choir today? That is a brand-new arrangement of the musical number sung during the 1973 devotional when President Lee visited this campus. Donnell Hunter penned the lyrics, and Darwin Wolford composed the music expressly for that occasion-Brother Wolford has rearranged it for today. I don't know whether or not that song has ever been sung since October 26, 1973, but I would like to conclude with the words of that special composition: <br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How Glorious Is the Voice We Hear</strong><br /><br />&nbsp; <br /> <em>How glorious is the voice we hear from heaven!</em><br /><br /> <em>Now prophets drive the darkness from our lives.</em><br /><br /> <em>Hearken to their counsel; honor their priesthood;</em><br /><br /> <em>Receive the words our loving Father gives.</em><br /><br /> <em>&nbsp;</em><br /><br /> <em>Our prophet speaks to show the way to Zion,</em><br /><br /> <em>A refuge for the saints whose hearts are pure.</em><br /><br /> <em>Follow his example; treasure his message;</em><br /><br /> <em>Sustain his call and love will cast out fear</em><br /><br /> <em>&nbsp;</em><br /><br /> <em>His voice now calls to every tongue and nation.</em><br /><br /> <em>Each ear shall hear and every eye shall see.</em><br /><br /> <em>Listen to the Gospel; keep the commandments;</em><br /><br /> <em>Forsake the world. His truths will make you free. </em><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /> I count it one of the greatest blessings of my life to have found the true messengers of the Most High God, who hold the keys of the priesthood and guide us in the work and way of salvation in this dispensation. Today, I renew my unwavering allegiance to President Monson and his successors for the rest of my life. And I invite everyone watching or listening to this devotional today to do the same, that we may always "stand united in tribute to the living prophet." By so doing, our individual lives and this campus will be a beacon of loyalty to God and His prophets until the Savior comes again, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /> &nbsp;<br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>I want to thank everyone for the warm welcome to this beautiful campus. It is an honor to be here.<br /><br />On the university website, I read that the mission of Brigham Young University-Idaho is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities. &nbsp; <br /><br />What a blessing and opportunity for you to attend a university that is as concerned about your spiritual development as it is about your intellectual development. The world needs leaders who are founded upon the unchanging principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Much is expected of you as future leaders, and I look forward with hopeful anticipation to your leadership. &nbsp; <br /><br />Last Christmas, a friend presented us with clay replicas of the type of oil lamps that were used for light in the days of the Savior. As my husband and I prepared to gather our grandchildren and teach them the parable of the ten virgins using these lamps, I remembered what Elder David A. Bednar taught in the previous general conference. He spoke of this parable and recalled with us that the five foolish and unprepared virgins went to obtain oil for their lamps after hearing the cry to go and meet the bridegroom. &nbsp; <br /><br />"And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. &nbsp; <br /><br />"Afterward came also the [five foolish] virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. &nbsp; <br /><br />"But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not" (Matthew 25:10-12). &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Bednar emphasized that the Joseph Smith Translation clarified this phrase "I know you not" to "Ye know me not." &nbsp; <br /><br />"The [phrase] 'Ye know me not,'" said Elder Bednar, "should be a cause of deep spiritual introspection for each of us." He then posed the question, "Do we only know about the Savior, or are we increasingly coming to know Him?" ("If Ye Had Known Me," <em>Ensign,</em> Nov. 2016). That question is the basis of my message today. &nbsp; <br /><br />The Savior prayed, "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). Elder M. Russell Ballard, commenting on this scripture, said: "In other words, life eternal is predicated upon our own individual, personal knowledge of our Father in Heaven and His Holy Son. Simply knowing about them is not enough. We must have personal, spiritual experiences to anchor us. These come through seeking them in the same intense, single-minded way that a hungry person seeks food"<em> </em>("Feasting at the Lords Table," <em>Ensign,</em> May 1996, 80). <em></em> &nbsp; <br /><br />When my husband was presiding over the North Carolina Raleigh Mission, we received word that one of our young sister missionaries, Sister Melissa Peterson, had been killed in a car accident. Sister Peterson radiated light and love and was an exemplary missionary in every way. &nbsp; <br /><br />As my husband was making calls to get accurate information and trying to ensure that everything was handled properly, I sat in his office working through the shock and anguish I was feeling. A headline in an issue of the <em>Church News,</em> which was open next to me on the sofa, caught my eye. The large, bold letters read, "Mortal life: A time to find, serve, and know Jesus Christ" (<em>Church News,</em> Jan. 15, 2000). &nbsp; <br /><br />As I pondered that statement, my soul was comforted with the thought that Sister Peterson had been doing just that--her missionary service those past 16 months had focused her efforts on finding, serving, and knowing Jesus Christ. All was well with her. She had completed her mission on earth. &nbsp; <br /><br />Coming to know the Lord is the process of a lifetime. Fortunately, the scriptures are filled with principles to teach us how we are to come to know Him. &nbsp; <br /><br />Jesus taught that to know Him, we must learn of Him. He said, "Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit" (D&amp;C 19:23). <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <br /><br />In a worldwide devotional last January, President Russell M. Nelson invited young adults of the Church to get to know Jesus Christ by consecrating a portion of time each week to study and learn of Christ--to study everything Jesus said and did in the Old Testament, to study His laws as recorded in the New Testament, to study His doctrine in the Book of Mormon, and to study His words recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. Also included in President Nelson's invitation was encouragement to study "all He continues to teach through His living prophets and apostles" and to "study 'The Living Christ' document." &nbsp; <br /><br />President Nelson said: "This may seem like a large assignment. But I encourage you to accept it. If you proceed to learn <em>all</em> you can about Jesus Christ, I promise you that your love for Him, and for God's laws, will grow beyond what you currently imagine. I promise you also that your ability to turn away from sin will increase. Your desire to keep the commandments will soar. You will find yourself better able to walk away from the entertainment and entanglements of those who mock the followers of Jesus Christ" ("Prophets, Leadership, and Divine Law" [Church Educational System devotional for young adults, Jan. 8, 2017], broadcasts.lds.org). &nbsp; <br /><br />President Nelson knew he could give this assignment because he had accepted it himself and accomplished it in six weeks. He had read and underlined every verse cited about Jesus Christ as listed under 57 subtitles in the Topical Guide. (See Russell M. Nelson, "Drawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives," <em>Ensign, </em>May 2017.) &nbsp; <br /><br />I have invited Chaz Egnew, who accepted President Nelson's invitation to study and learn of Christ, to share with us how it has made a difference in his life. &nbsp; <br /><br />ESPLIN: Chaz, will you come join me at the podium. &nbsp; <br /><br />Tell us where you're from and how long you've been here at this university. &nbsp; <br /><br />EGNEW: I'm from town called Spring Hill, Tennessee. It's about 45 minutes south of Nashville. And this is my fourth semester up here at BYU-Idaho, and I'm studying communications. &nbsp; <br /><br />ESPLIN: When President Nelson issued this invitation, were you a little overwhelmed with wondering how you'd find the time, or did you just dive right in and do it? &nbsp; <br /><br />EGNEW: Yeah, I was kind of overwhelmed; I didn't know where to start at first. I thought about doing Sunday nights, but they didn't work out so well. And then around general conference time, I was talking with my grandma, and she said something about the Topical Guide. And the thought came to me to take 10 minutes out of my personal study time and just follow the Topical Guide and study about Jesus Christ. &nbsp; <br /><br />ESPLIN: Share with us how consecrating this time every week to study the words and the life and the teachings of Christ has affected your life. What difference has it made? &nbsp; <br /><br />EGNEW: I think it's really helped me know that I have time for the Lord in my week, that I have time to hear from Him and to know the things that He embodies. And it's helped me to really put my faith in Him, because there are so many examples in the Topical Guide--and through the scriptures--of Him and how His power is infinite and how His love is infinite. It's made me love Him even more. &nbsp; <br /><br />ESPLIN: And maybe you've answered the next question I was just thinking of, or maybe you'll think of something else. President Nelson promised that your love for Him would grow, and you've expressed that that really has happened. And he also promised that your ability to become more like Him would increase. &nbsp; <br /><br />EGNEW: For me, it's helped me feel lighter and happier. It's made me be able to see the light in other people and to feel a little bit of His love for them. &nbsp; <br /><br />ESPLIN: Thank you, Chaz, for sharing your experience with us. &nbsp; <br /><br />When President Nelson finished this exercise and his wife asked how it had impacted him, he told her, "'I am a different man!' I felt a renewed devotion to [Christ]" ("Drawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives," <em>Ensign, </em>May 2017). &nbsp; <br /><br />I too, like Chaz, accepted President Nelson's invitation. I wondered how I would find the time but took courage when President Nelson said, "Each of us who takes this challenge will finish in our own time frames" ("I Studied More Than 2,200 Scriptures about the Savior in Six Weeks: Here Is a Little of What I Learned," <em>LDS.org</em>, published Feb. 28, 2017, https://www.lds.org/blog/i-studied-more-than-2200-scriptures-about-the-savior-in-six-weeks-here-is-a-little-of-what-i-learned?lang=eng).<br />Much of my desire to accept this invitation came from the feelings I had when President Nelson said: <br /><br />"In a coming day, you will present yourself before the Savior. You will be overwhelmed to the point of tears to be in His holy presence. You will struggle to find words to thank Him for paying for your sins, for forgiving you of any unkindness toward others, for healing you from the injuries and injustices of this life. <br /><br />"You will thank Him for strengthening you to do the impossible, for turning your weaknesses into strengths, and for making it possible for you to live with Him and your family forever. His identity, His Atonement, and His attributes will become personal and real to you" ("Prophets, Leadership, and Divine Law" [Church Educational System devotional for young adults, Jan. 8, 2017], broadcasts.lds.org). &nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe some of you have taken this challenge. Perhaps others of you don't know how you could possibly find the time. Would you take a minute and share with your neighbor how you have grown from learning more about the Savior or what you could do to commit to spend some time each week to do that. &nbsp; <br /><br />[AUDIENCE DISCUSSION] &nbsp; <br /><br />I hope you have been prompted to make this a priority in your life.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />As we strive to know the Savior through diligent study and prayer, we invite the Holy Ghost to testify to us of Him. His communication to our spirit carries far more certainty than we can receive through our natural senses. The only way we can receive a sure testimony of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ is by the power of the Holy Ghost (see <em>True to The Faith: A Gospel Reference</em> [2004], 82). &nbsp; <br /><br />This truth was illustrated when Jesus asked His "disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? &nbsp; <br /><br />"And they said, Some&nbsp;say that thou art&nbsp;John the Baptist: some,&nbsp;Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. &nbsp; <br /><br />"He saith unto them, But whom say&nbsp;ye&nbsp;that I am? &nbsp; <br /><br />"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. &nbsp; <br /><br />"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 16:13-17). &nbsp; <br /><br />In a day with increasing commotion, distractions, and hurried frenzy, it takes intentional effort to put ourselves in a place where we can hear the still, small voice of the Spirit testifying of Christ and the truthfulness of His words. "Be still," He said, "and know that I am God" (Psalms 46:10).<strong></strong> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <br /><br />John the Beloved taught another principle that is essential if we are to know the Lord. He said, "Hereby we do know that we know [God], if we keep his commandments" (1 John 2:3).</p>
<p>Before we came to this earth, we understood that obedience was a way to come to know God. We were taught that earth life was to be a period of testing, to prove us to see if we would do all things whatsoever the Lord shall command us (see Abraham 3:25). <br /><br />Elder D. Todd Christofferson explained: "Some see only sacrifice and limitations in obedience to the commandments ..., but those who live the experience--who give themselves freely and unreservedly to the covenant life--find greater liberty and fulfillment. When we truly understand, we seek more commandments, not fewer. Each new law or commandment we learn and live is like one more rung or step on a ladder that enables us to climb higher and higher" &nbsp;("The Power of Covenants," <em>Ensign</em>, May 2009). <br /><br />Our son-in-law Jeff recalls that through some of his teenage years, there were times he saw the commandments of God as restrictive, and he was like the kite that would cut its string at every opportunity. At that point in his life, obedience was a challenge. He would obey at times largely out of duty to his family or when motivated by fear of punishment. He says he didn't feel a love for the Savior--that he did not really know Him. Fortunately, through the influence of those around him, including his parents and a Young Men adviser, he was obedient enough that the Spirit could touch him with some understanding and desire to do good. Line upon line, he slowly progressed and became converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ. <br /><br />Jeff remembers: "Looking back 30 years later, I can see that I have been caught up in a virtuous cycle of obeying and receiving light and knowledge, which causes me to want to obey more. I see in my own life the truth that President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught: 'We come to see obedience not as a punishment but as a liberating path to our divine destiny. And gradually, the corruption, dust, and limitations of this earth begin to fall away. Eventually, the priceless, eternal spirit of the heavenly being within us is revealed, and a radiance of goodness becomes our nature'" ("He Will Place You on His Shoulders and Carry You Home," <em>Ensign</em>, May 2016). <br /><br />With that in mind, is it any wonder the Lord said, "Behold, this is your work, to keep my commandments, yea, with all your might, mind and strength" (D&amp;C 11:20)? &nbsp; <br /><br />One of the surest ways we come to know the Savior is through serving Him. King Benjamin asked, "How knoweth the man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?" (Mosiah 5:13). &nbsp; <br /><br />If we wish to know the Lord, we must be willing to bear one another's burdens. "As we reach out to others in their times of need, we find that we draw not only closer to them, but also closer to Him who gave the ultimate in bearing the burdens of mankind" ("Expanding our Focus," <em>Church News,</em> Jan. 23, 1993). &nbsp; <br /><br />Think back over the past few weeks of your life.&nbsp;What service have you performed?&nbsp;Share with your neighbor how lifting another's burdens has drawn you closer both to those you helped and to the Savior, perhaps in ways you didn't realize until right now. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />[AUDIENCE DISCUSSION] &nbsp; <br /><br />I wonder if any of you mentioned the temple as service you performed. &nbsp; <br /><br />With our temple callings, my husband and I spend many hours in the Lord's house. The purpose of the temple and its sacred ordinances is to help us draw near to God and become more like Him. &nbsp; <br /><br />President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley explained: "Just as our Redeemer gave His life as a vicarious sacrifice for all men, and in so doing became our Savior, even so we, in a small measure, when we engage in proxy work in the temple, become as saviors to those on the other side who have no means of advancing unless something is done in their behalf by those on earth" ("Closing Remarks,"<em>&nbsp;</em><em></em><em>Ensign,</em>&nbsp;Nov. 2004, 105). &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Carlos E. Asay recalled as a young adult attending the Manti Temple and coming to the realization that there is no better place than the Lord's house to become better acquainted with our Heavenly Father and His Son, the Savior of mankind. He later taught: "No one can really know another unless he has seen him in his home and visited him in familiar surroundings.... So it is with friends and neighbors in their homes, and so it is with God in his place of abode--the temple" ("The Temple: The Place for You," <em>New Era,</em> Mar. 1997). &nbsp; <br /><br />More than ever before, we see young people like you coming to serve and worship in the temple. &nbsp; <br /><br />Prophets and apostles have promised great power and blessings to those who find their own ancestors and take their names to the temple. Elder Dale G. Renlund recently said, "You will find not only protection from the temptation and ills of the world, but you will also find personal power--power to change, power to repent, power to learn, power to be sanctified, and power to turn the hearts of your family members to each other and heal that which needs healing" ("Family History and Temple Blessings," <em>Ensign,</em> Feb. 2017, 31). &nbsp; <br /><br />Recently, I asked one of our young adult ordinance workers, who is also a full-time student and works part-time, if he found it difficult to make time to serve weekly in the temple. He said, "Being an ordinance worker gets me to the temple every week, and I need the clarity and understanding I receive in the temple for my schoolwork and all the important decisions I am making in my life." &nbsp; <br /><br />You are blessed to live near a beautiful temple here in Rexburg. Now is the time to make temple service and temple worship a pattern in your life. If you aren't endowed, you can perform baptisms and confirmations for those on the other side of the veil. If you are endowed, you can perform washings and anointings, endowments, and sealings. &nbsp; <br /><br />As you participate in the sacred ordinances of the temple and are faithful to your covenants, you are promised that you may go forth from the temple armed with God's power, with His name upon you, His glory round about you, and His angels having charge over you (see D&amp;C 109:22). &nbsp; <br /><br />I close with the words of President Thomas S. Monson: <br /><br />"Let us ... follow in the footsteps of the Master. As you and I walk the pathway Jesus walked, let us listen for the sound of sandaled feet. Let us reach out for the Carpenter's hand. Then we shall come to know Him. He may come to us as one unknown, without a name, as by the lakeside He came to those men who knew Him not. He speaks to us the same words, 'Follow thou me' (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/21.22?lang=eng#21">John 21:22</a>), and sets us to the task which He has to fulfill for our time. He commands, and to those who obey Him, whether they be wise or simple, He will reveal Himself in the toils, the conflicts, the sufferings that they shall pass through in His fellowship; and they shall learn by their own experience who He is. <br /><br />"We will discover He is more than the Babe in Bethlehem, more than the carpenter's son, more than the greatest teacher ever to live. We will come to know Him as the Son of God, our Savior and our Redeemer"&nbsp;("The Call of Duty," <em>Ensign</em>, April 1986). &nbsp; <br /><br />It is my experience and my testimony that as we consecrate a portion of our study each week to learn all we can of our Savior, Jesus Christ, as we obey His commandments with exactness, as we serve Him diligently, and as we attend the temple, we will come to know Him better than we have ever known Him; we will come to trust in Him more than we have ever trusted in Him and will love Him more than we have ever loved Him. We will have the assurance that when He comes again, we will be ready to meet Him, and <em>we shall know Him</em>. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;</p>

<p>General Authority Seventy</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Elder Eduardo Gavarret was sustained as a General Authority Seventy of The Church of Jesus&nbsp;Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 5, 2008. At the time of his call, he had been serving in the bishopric of the Santa Cruz Ward in the Limatambo Stake in Lima, Peru. He has served as a member of the Fourth Quorum of the Seventy, a counselor in the South America Northwest Area Presidency, an Assistant Executive Director in the Missionary and Information and Communication Services Departments, and a second counselor in the Brazil Area Presidency. He is currently serving at Church headquarters in Salt Lake City. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

In 2000, he also received an MBA in marketing from INPG-MBA in Brazil. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />He was employed by Tecnofarma for eighteen years, working for that company in Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil. He then worked as a general manager for IVAX Corporation in Peru and later as the business director for Brazil. In 2006 GP Pharm S.A. employed him in Peru as general manager and also as regional manager for Central America and Uruguay. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Gavarret has served in a number of Church callings, including full-time missionary in the Uruguay Paraguay Mission, branch president, stake executive secretary, bishop, stake mission president, stake president, regional representative, Area Authority, Area Seventy, high councilor, temple worker, and Brazil Missionary Training Center branch counselor, president of the Paraguay Asuncion Mission, and counselor in a bishopric. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Eduardo Gavarret Inzaurrale was born in Minas, Lavalleja, Uruguay, on May 11, 1956. He married Norma Beatriz Gorgoroso Martirena in October 1978. They are the parents of three children.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Pre-devotional discussion:</strong><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;"></strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">I.<br /></strong>Alexander the Great raised his desire to the gods by saying, "I would rather live a short life of glory than a long one of obscurity."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> "The gods" listened to him. Alexander was the youngest conqueror, with the greatest number of conquests at that time, in an empire that encompassed the whole of the Mediterranean. He died at age 33.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Perhaps in your life there will be no opportunities to discover new lands or to conquer countries and kingdoms and have a short and glorious life that will be remembered for centuries upon centuries. However, we aspire to another kind of glory. The kingdoms and worlds to rule are framed in the heavens. Open your eyes to the horizon, and you will see. The battle that is in front of you is real and has a commander in chief: you. You are the captain of your ship, the discoverer of new lands, the general of your army, the conqueror of your kingdom. The glory that we aspire to and that we will receive for the victory of that battle is in front of us, in front of you. How can we overcome this great battle and obtain the desired and promised reward to the victors? <br /><br />Without diminishing the merit of Alexander the Great, whose place in the history of the world is indisputable, let us consider another conqueror who lived before Alexander and whose story was written in the book of the earth and the heavens. <br /><br />Of his life one could write, "Long life with glory." <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>II.</strong><br />Joshua was chosen by God to succeed Moses as leader of the Israelites during the conquest of Canaan. Joshua conquered most of the territory of the promised land and distributed it among the twelve tribes of Israel. This took place possibly around 1230-1210 b.c. He is revered by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. He died at age 110. <strong></strong> <br /><br />Joshua, the son of Nun of the tribe of Ephraim, was first called Hosea, meaning "saved," "a rescuer," or "savior." Subsequently, Moses, guided by the Spirit, named him Joshua, meaning "he saves" or the "salvation of Jehovah," referring to the role he would play. At the end of his life he brought the people together to give them a blessing, as well as final advice and a warning: "<em>Choose</em> you this day whom ye will serve; ... as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> <br /><br />How did Joshua reach that level of commitment? Obviously, they were not words spoken lightly. His life had been in the service of God, and his statement was a declaration of his conduct for many years. How can we reach that level of commitment to also say, "Today, I and my house will serve the Lord"? <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>III.</strong><br />Let us first speak of one of the intrinsic components of this statement: knowledge. Knowledge has its origin in the Greek word <em>gnosis</em>. <a name="_Hlk482477894"></a>That means personal or spiritual knowledge or specific knowledge of the divine. Knowledge is the act or effect of knowing. It is the capacity of man to understand, through reason, the nature, qualities, and relationships of things. <br /><br />You are in one of the meccas of knowledge. It is called the temple of learning. Nowadays, the power to obtain knowledge is within the reach of everyone more than at any time in history. The university will guide you to obtain it and teach you how to apply it; in turn, you must form discipline to increase your knowledge through a diligent personal search. However, the application of this knowledge has its roots in the land of desire, and its fruits bloom in the branches of action. That desire for greater knowledge led the ancient and modern prophets and others to increase their level of information and understanding. <br /><br />Abraham expressed: "And, finding there was greater happiness and peace and rest for me, I sought the blessings of the fathers, ... having been myself a follower of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge, and to be a father of many nations, a prince of peace, and desiring to receive instructions, and to keep the commandments of God."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> <br /><br />Abraham passed from great knowledge to greater knowledge, from follower to a more faithful follower, because of his desire, search, learning, and action. <br /><br />Joseph Smith had the desire to obtain wisdom: "I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: <em>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him</em>.... <br /><br />"I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> <br /><br />And the resultant act initiated the First Vision. Desire, curiosity, faith, knowledge, more faith, more knowledge, action, fruit. Knowledge without action will not provide development. <br /><br />A clear example of this is the following artifact, a children's toy, from the Mayan culture. We can see, in that toy, that the knowledge of the wheel was there, but they did not use it for other purposes.</p>
<p><img alt="Toy with wheels" height="250" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring%202017/Graphics/Toy-with-Wheels_300x250.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />We have other examples outside of the scriptures regarding the sincere quest for knowledge, and we might cite some as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marie Curie (1867-1934), possibly the most well-known female scientist in the world, which is supported by her two Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry.<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> <br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Albert Einstein (1879-1955), the world's best-known scientist, making great contributions to physics and mathematics. <a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> <br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philo Taylor Farnsworth (1906-1971), an American Mormon inventor known for creating the first fully electronic television.<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> <br /><br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russell M. Nelson (1924-), a cardiovascular surgeon who performed surgical work on people's hearts rather than replacing them with an artificial alternative.<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a></p>
<p>Even though these people made a difference, their search for knowledge was not limited to just getting information; it was followed by action. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>IV.</strong><br />"Seek learning, even by study and also by faith."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> <br /><br />Regarding this subject, Elder Orson F. Whitney said the following in 1888: "Faith points to futurity, to things that will be; study pertains more to the past, to things that have been. History is temporal; prophecy is spiritual. The past is great, but the future will be greater. The dead letter may be precious, but the living oracle is beyond all price."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> <br /><br />The pursuit of knowledge is something that pleases our Father, and yet, what is the knowledge that He desires us to obtain and put in first place in our education? Which is the one that makes the true difference?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span> <br /><br />"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. <br /><br />"And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> <br /><br />To what knowledge is he referring? It is not to secular knowledge, which is undoubtedly of great importance and is described within our responsibilities as children of God; however, this scripture refers to the knowledge of doctrine and, especially, the plan of salvation and the doctrine of Christ. The purpose of this plan is summarized in this expression of the Father: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> With this in mind:</p>
<p>Knowledge of the laws of the gospel and its application will motivate us to act differently. You will be able to make a difference in your life and in the lives of those around you. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>V.</strong><br />Edmund Burke, an eighteenth-century Irish politician and writer, said, "The only thing evil needs to succeed is for good men (and women) to do nothing."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> It is the time to not only be passive spectators with knowledge but to be active participants with the knowledge of the truth. <br /><br />Let's see a couple of examples of people who were not mere spectators: <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></em> <br /><br />Queen Esther could have remained silent and perhaps been justified by her position and by the customs of the court. She took the right attitude, and her courage allowed her to save her people. She overcame the fear and was not only a good woman but a woman of courage who put well-being of others before her safety. <br /><br />Oskar Schindler was a German businessman, and a member of the Nazi party, who saved the lives of 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust by employing them as workers in his factories. He made the decision to do right beyond his own interests. The Schindler list--the group of people whom he saved--is a modern example of love and sacrifice. There were names to be added. One by one people were taken in. One by one they were saved. <a name="_Hlk482533524"></a>Today, more than 7,000 descendants come from that act. He made the difference by acting. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>VI.</strong><br />Now I would like to tell you, the heroes and heroines of the present are here. And they are you. I am sure that the fiber, the drive needed to make a difference and generate what is called the power of one, the power to act, the power to speak up, based on the knowledge of the gospel, and thus generate a change, is here; it is within you. <br /><br />Are not we all heroes of our premortal life? We all opposed Lucifer and his plan. We were born winners, and we are on the team that will win the battle. Now, with the knowledge we have, we must make the decision to rise above our own weaknesses and move forward with our eyes on the One who saves us. <br /><br />Alexander the Great expressed, "In the end, when everything is over, the only thing that matters is what you have done."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> And Joshua: "Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us . . . and the Lord is with us."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a> At the end of the day, we can say that what we have done truly has value because we have relied on the Lord of Hosts. You can make that difference. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>"</strong>Let us onward, then, and upward, keeping the goal in view; living not in the dead past, nor for the dying present. The future is our field. Eternity is before us."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>VII.</strong><br />And now, where to start?<strong> </strong>Start for yourself.</p>
<p>It becomes necessary not only to know the plan. After you have studied, and after you have understood, you must entrust your faith in the Savior, through whom the plan is set forth. Put in front of you the reward that you will gain in the end by coming out victorious in your personal battle: "Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a> <br /><br />The knowledge of all the "clauses" of the plan--which includes not only general knowledge but also obligations, responsibilities, as well as the inherent blessings of applying it--will allow you to walk amidst the challenges, temptations, and doctrines of the world, with the assurance of one who walks on a dark path with a powerful light. Remember that He is the light. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>VIII</strong><br />Do not choose the path of mediocrity, which comes with complacency and apathy. Be determined to be different; exercise the power that is in you, and make a difference. <br /><br />You were a winner from the beginning. By participating positively in the premortal council, you and I obtained the "ticket" to come to earth and have the possibility to continue advancing. However, our brothers and sisters there who made the decision to follow a false leader, due to their impulse, uncertainty, and negligence in listening (and obeying), lost the opportunity to come to earth and to have a body. Nevertheless, the knowledge of the plan indicates to us that the test continues, and we cannot simply sit idly by and wait. <br /><br />Just as Joshua became one of Israel's great lawmakers and an example to follow, so too can you become an example by making a difference in your life by applying the same principles. Edmund Burke's words can help us to be attentive not only to be "good" people but to be of those who choose and mark the way, who establish the difference, who use the knowledge of the gospel and the secular to establish a difference in themselves and in the environment. <br /><br />President Thomas S. Monson said, "You can't be right by doing wrong; you can't be wrong by doing right."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a> Choosing whom to serve and where to make a difference begins with the desire to follow Jesus Christ, and this means obeying His commandments. <br /><br />Heavenly Father loves all His children, from the purest and most just to the vilest sinner. He loves us all, but He says: "I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance; Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>IX</strong><br />Through the acquisition of knowledge of the commandments, we will know what is right and what is not, and thus we will be inwardly prepared to actively participate in favor of the freedom from deception, from false doctrines, from the adversary's influence, and thus be an active contributor in the process of happiness, because according to the plan, "men [and women] are, that they might have joy."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a> <br /><br />However, the scriptures warn us against the adversary's plan, which says: "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us.... <br /><br />"Yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words ... there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</a> <br /><br />The world says that "it is well," that "we are in a new age." Who is the author of all these doctrines and deviations? "Behold Satan hath come among the children of men, and tempteth them to worship him; and men have become carnal, sensual, and devilish, and are shut out from the presence of God."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="">[22]</a><em> </em> <br /><br />The warning and the antidote are in the scriptures: "Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body" (1 Corinthians 6:18).<em></em> <br /><br />We can find a very clear warning against homosexuality (Romans 1:26-27 and 1 Corinthians 6:9). <br /><br />"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ" (Colossians 2:8). <br /><br />"The Family: A Proclamation to the World" represents the true message that comes from the Father to prevent us against the false doctrines regarding marriage and gender. <br /><br />Do not be carried away by social movements whose messages or activities are contrary to the Father's plan. Remember that there is no double standard for the Father. Treat all with kindness, but be direct and clear, and preach by example and by word about the values ​​that Christ taught us. Do not plead for causes contrary to the plan; rather raise your voice against sin, whatever it may be. "Ye are an example to the world: follow not after them"<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">[23]</a> Mark the difference, raise your voice, decide to act as a true disciple of the truth. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>X</strong><br />We can develop the character of Moroni, of whom it was said, "Yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, if all men [and women] had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title="">[24]</a> Is that not wonderful? If we feed each day our being with these words, our confidence and inner power will increase. <br /><br />And now what? What will you do today with the knowledge you already have of the gospel? Do you go deeper looking for a firm base to move forward? Look at Him; focus on Him; remember that "there are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title="">[25]</a>Think and remember the following as strengths to move on:</p>
<p><strong>XI</strong><br />Today I invite you to make a difference in your life by saying:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And Joshua made a covenant<em> </em>with the people that day. "[He] wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone ... and ... said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="">[28]</a> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>XII</strong><br />We can raise our voice and say, "We will serve Jehovah," and symbolically place a stone in our room that reminds us of the covenant we have made with Him. Better than that, we can keep our "stone" with us: our temple recommend, which will remind us of our covenants to obey Him. <br /><br />"Ye are an example to the world: follow not after them."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">[29]</a> <br /><br />Obtain knowledge and testimony of the plan, apply it, and teach it. Do not be distracted by social movements that are contrary to the truth. Be kind but firm. There are many noble causes to fight for. Be one of those who paves the road and makes a difference. Remember, you are a winner, born a winner. You really can make a big difference. <br /><br />Choose a noble cause for the Lord by which to fight, and apply your energy. There are people to help, hands to lift, weakened knees to strengthen, prisoners to visit and rescue, hungry to feed, naked to clothe, and sick to heal. Raise your voice. Be true to yourselves and loyal to your mission. <br /><br />"Ye are the 'hope of Israel.' The heavens are watching you, and the earth is waiting for you."<a href="/devotionals/elder-eduardo-gavarret-spring-2017#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title="">[30]</a> &nbsp;<br />Mark the difference. Establish your personal covenant with Him, our Savior, and say, "For me and my house, we will serve the Lord." And doing so, others also will be blessed. <br /><br />In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<em></em><br /><br /><br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to be here with you today, and I am genuinely looking forward to our time together. It is my hope that we will have the chance to explore widely, think deeply, and, hopefully, have some fun while we are doing it.<br /><br />I'd like to begin with a true story from many years ago, when I was a young lawyer working on Capitol Hill for then Senator Joe Biden, who of course eventually became Vice President Biden. At that time there was a legislative aide who worked for another senator who happened to be pursuing me. And thanks to this young man, I was on the receiving end of one of the more creative "pickup lines" ever to come my way. &nbsp; <br /><br />What single question would you ask of God? I thought long and hard. At first I considered some of the obvious ones: How can we eliminate poverty? How can we achieve world peace? But as I pondered it, I concluded that we probably already knew the answer to those "big" questions--what we lack is the will to do what needs to be done.<br /><br />In the end, I decided that I would use my precious encounter with Deity to ask a very personal question. The query I decided I would pose to God if I had the opportunity was "What will be the greatest moral challenge of my life, and will I be equal to it? Will I meet it?" &nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to suggest to you today that perhaps the great moral challenge of our time is, will we find a way to defend and extend the blessing of religious freedom--or, more broadly, freedom of religion, conscience, and belief--in a world where it is surely in peril? The reason I consider this to be such a central question is that I am convinced that freedom of religion, conscience, and belief is truly the wellspring freedom from which so many of our other cherished fundamental rights derive. Indeed, it has often been referred to as the first freedom--not only because it is the first freedom protected in the First Amendment of our revered Bill of Rights, but because it is the source from which so many of the precious rights we revere flow. &nbsp; <br /><br />Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, equal protection of the law--I think a strong argument can be made that each one of these pillars of a democratic, tolerant, rights-respecting, and pluralistic society is anchored in the bedrock protection for freedom of religion, and so I would argue that its defense is truly one of the great challenges of our time. And I would argue that its defense is not merely a moral imperative but a pragmatic one as well. &nbsp; <br /><br />Several years ago, I traveled to Berlin to participate in the OSCE's 10-year anniversary conference examining the problem of anti-Semitism in the EU, which, as I'm sure many of you know, has seen an alarming rise in recent years. It was a sobering and discouraging conference in many ways, but an experience I had while there also reinforced my conviction that history is not kind to, nor does it ultimately reward, those who trample on the religious rights and freedoms of others. &nbsp; <br /><br />This truth was vividly underscored while on a brief tour of Berlin during a break from the conference. I was struck by the comment of the tour guide that when the Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685, thousands of persecuted Huguenots fled from France to the city of Berlin, where they started many of the industries and trades that became the backbone of that region's economy. You will recall that the Edict of Nantes, signed in 1598 by Henry IV of France, had granted the Calvinist Huguenots substantial rights in a nation that was overwhelmingly Catholic. &nbsp; <br /><br />One might view the Edict of Nantes as an early advancement of the right to freedom of religion, and its revocation was a huge step backwards, but the key point I want to make is that by driving the Huguenots out of their land, it was the French who suffered economically and in other ways from their departure, and the land that gave them refuge benefited. &nbsp; <br /><br />I don't think it is too much of a stretch to see some analogies to the controversies of today regarding refugees and immigrants seeking to come to our country, and the hot controversies surrounding President Trump's recent executive orders and whether they are simply a proper exercise of executive authority regarding protecting U.S. security and controlling our nation's borders or whether they are a constitutionally flawed form of religious discrimination. Perhaps we can talk about that further during the question-and-answer period, but the point I would like to emphasize here, as illustrated by the case of the Huguenots' fleeing to Berlin, is that protecting religious liberty is not just the right thing to do; it is almost always, in the long run, the smart thing to do as well. &nbsp; <br /><br />In fact, I have come to believe that our historically unique and very bold idea in the United States to provide for both the separation of church and state and the unfettered free exercise of religion really was sort of the secret sauce that made our grand American experiment so extraordinarily successful. But while the broad and capacious understanding of religious freedom may have been distinctive to the American experience in the late 1700s, the fact is that now, freedom of conscience and belief is a universal value endorsed by the majority of countries in Article 18 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as in subsequent covenants. Like every other human right, religious freedom is a birthright of humanity, and we are increasingly coming to recognize that it is a pivotal right without which it will be difficult, if not impossible, to successfully address some of our gravest threats globally. &nbsp; <br /><br />So what do we mean by the term "freedom of religion and belief"? In Article 18 of the UD, it is outlined as follows: &nbsp; <br /><br />"Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance." &nbsp; <br /><br />This is a powerful, broad, generous, and encompassing definition of freedom of religion and belief, and in the ICCPR it is further elaborated upon to extend this right even further. There we find protection from coercion that impairs someone's ability to have or adopt the belief of their choice. The ICCPR limits the circumstances under which freedom of religion and belief can be infringed upon for broader public purposes and further discusses protections for parents in educating their children in their religious convictions and protections for minority religious communities.<br /><br />It is an impressive international legal commitment to this fundamental right, but if we recast it in more human and less legal terminology, we might say that freedom of religion, conscience, and belief means nothing less than the right of each of us to think as we please, believe or not believe as our conscience leads, and to live out our beliefs openly, peacefully, and without fear. <br /><br />It seems simple enough, and yet, as I'm sure you are all aware, this basic human right is honored more in the breach than in its observance. According to recent studies by the Pew Foundation, more than 75 percent of the world's population lives in countries that significantly restrict freedom of religion and belief. And this is not just a regrettable affront to our values and aspirations for the world to be a nicer place; it poses a real and growing threat to our own freedoms and even to our national security. If you pause to briefly consider the countries and regions in the world that pose the greatest risks to American security, you will find that in almost every case, they are characterized by severe violations of religious freedom. &nbsp; <br /><br />Studies by Pew Research Foundation and others have found a strong correlation between the robust protection of religious freedom and other social goods such as stability, prosperity, democracy, and, interestingly, higher socioeconomic status for women. &nbsp; <br /><br />The flip side of this coin is very worrying. Societies that restrict religious freedom become potential breeding grounds for instability, social tension, and violent extremism. Just look at the headlines. From Pakistan to Iran, Saudi Arabia to China, North Korea to Burma, wherever we see the repression of religious freedom, it is accompanied by a host of other manifestations of repression, and these pose real risks to all of us. I strongly believe that the protection of this pivotal human right should be a profound priority of our nation not only because religious-freedom abuses violate the core of our humanity but because they do grave harm to the order and well-being of societies. &nbsp; <br /><br />They do so politically, as religious-freedom abuses are correlated with the absence of democracy and of broad political participation from religious and ethnic groups. &nbsp; <br /><br />They do so economically, as religious persecution destabilizes communities and marginalizes the persecuted, causing their talents and abilities to go unrealized, robbing a nation of added productivity, and reducing a nation's ability to fight poverty and create abundance for its citizens. &nbsp; <br /><br />They do so civically, since wherever religious freedom is dishonored, the benefit of religion in molding people's character is diminished and with it the self-discipline necessary to handle the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. &nbsp; <br /><br />And finally, they do so socially, since whenever religious freedom is abused, peace and tolerance become ever more elusive. If you think about it, it is the ultimate marker of a mature society when people of different beliefs and convictions can, on a fully equal basis, inhabit the public square side by side with one another. &nbsp; <br /><br />To reiterate what I said earlier, protecting religious freedom is not only a moral and humanitarian imperative but a practical necessity, one that is key to building a safer, more stable and secure world. &nbsp; <br /><br />During my four years serving on USCIRF, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, it was very important to me that in the midst of dealing with annual reports and recommendations to our government about which countries should be designated as CPCs--Countries of Particular Concern--and whether or not sanctions of one sort or another should be pursued--that we--that I--didn't lose sight of the very human face of religious-freedom abuses and that we kept the actual victims uppermost in our minds in all the work that we did. I'd like to share two stories that underscore the very human dimension of the topic we are discussing today. &nbsp; <br /><br />First, I would like to tell you a bit about Vian Dakhil and the Yazidi people. Just a few months ago, the Lantos Foundation, which I head, awarded Ms. Dakhil our highest honor, the Lantos Human Rights Prize. Let me tell you a bit about her and her community.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Vian Dakhil is the only female Yazidi member of the Iraqi parliament. The Yazidi faith is an ancient syncretic religion (syncretic meaning something that combines or blends elements from two or more sources). Their faith combines elements of Zoroastrianism with parts of Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. There are between 600 and 850,000 Yazidis in the world, with the vast majority of them living in the Nineveh province of Iraq. &nbsp; <br /><br />Over two years ago, this ancient faith community became the target of a genocidal campaign at the hands of the brutal terror group ISIS--surely one of the most appalling abusers of the right of religious freedom that the world has seen. ISIS is determined to purify the land under their control of all those that don't conform to their fanatical and twisted version of Islam. Sadly, the world took little notice as thousands of Yazidis were killed and thousands more of their women and girls were captured and enslaved. Tens of thousands more fled their homes where they became trapped on Mt. Sinjar, where they faced death through starvation, exposure, and from the killers of ISIS. &nbsp; <br /><br />No one was coming to save them: not the Iraqi military, not the Kurds, not the Americans. They were a small, forgotten people about to be left to a tragic fate. It was at this moment of supreme danger that Vian Dakhil stepped forward. She delivered a remarkable, impassioned, anguished speech before the Iraqi parliament, in which she sought to arouse the conscience of a callous and indifferent world. &nbsp; <br /><br />If you have ever wondered whether one voice can make a difference, Vian Dakhil's powerful call to action that day is incontrovertible evidence that the answer is yes. Her speech went viral, and within days President Obama announced both a humanitarian and military effort to rescue the stranded and threatened Yazidi people on Mt. Sinjar. &nbsp; <br /><br />I'd like to play for you a brief video of Vian's speech and its aftermath. &nbsp; <br /><br />Every time I watch the video of Vian's speech, I am riveted by her searing appeal to a seemingly heedless world. If you listen carefully, you can hear the sound of an unseen voice attempting to shush Vian, in effect saying, "Calm down. Don't make a scene. No one wants to hear you." I am so grateful Vian would not be shushed, would not quiet down--that the cause of her people was more important to her than the niceties of parliamentary decorum. When I see her speech, I am challenged to be more impassioned in my own defense of the defenseless, to be willing to take more risks to stand up for my fellow human beings and their most basic human rights. &nbsp; <br /><br />When I revisit that powerful moment, I find myself asking, "What if?" What if Vian had not spoken out? What if her words had not broken through the smug and distracted indifference that so often characterizes those in positions of power and influence and, quite frankly, all of us? We can never fully know what the alternate outcome would have been, but we can say with assurance that tens of thousands more lives would have been lost, and a proud and ancient faith community might have been lost to the world. &nbsp; <br /><br />The second story I would like to share with you today is that of a young man in Saudi Arabia by the name of Raif Badawi, whom I have never met. For the crime of writing a blog advocating for greater freedom of conscience in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes scheduled to be meted out at the rate of 50 a week for 20 weeks--in all likelihood a de facto death sentence. This took place during the time I was serving on the Commission. Several of us on the Commission felt we needed to do more than simply write the standard letter to the Saudi government protesting this brutal and unwarranted punishment. <br /><br />At the suggestion of my colleague Professor Robert George, we wrote to the Saudis asking them to remit this unjust sentence, but beyond that we requested that, if they would not vacate the sentence, we each be allowed to take one hundred lashes in Raif's place. We of course understood that the likelihood of the Saudis honoring our request was extremely remote, but we all felt that we should not sign the letter unless we were in fact ready to follow through and take the lashes in his stead. The process of reflection on what that might mean made the reality of the courage and suffering of people like Raif incredibly real and suddenly personal to each one of us. As word of our letter got out, we were contacted by dozens and eventually thousands of individuals from around the world who were moved by our offer and wanted to stand in solidarity with Raif, and with us, in offering to take part of his punishment. <br /><br />I can't tell you how profoundly moved I was by the sincerity, humility, and earnestness of the many people who reached out to us to express their determination to stand up for the rights of this young Saudi man. These wonderful people frequently moved me to tears. Although Raif remains imprisoned in Saudi, he has not been flogged since our campaign on his behalf. &nbsp; <br /><br />The stories I have shared with you and countless others have caused me to reflect on what it means to live a life of conscience and integrity. It can be--and indeed it is probably meant to be--a costly venture. But the defense of conscience, whether one's own or that of others, is a fight worth waging, because it is so inextricably linked to our fundamental dignity and freedom as human beings. &nbsp; <br /><br />One of my favorite works of literature is Robert Bolt's famous play "A Man for All Seasons," about Sir Thomas More. I realize that the British author Dame Hilary Mantel has popularized a much darker accounting of Thomas more through her books, but I remain a fan of Robert Bolt's depiction of the Lord Chancellor of England. &nbsp; <br /><br />In Bolt's depiction, we follow More as he tries to navigate the terrain between man's laws and God's laws and his ultimate duty to each. I brought my well-worn copy of the play, which I often have with me. I'd like to read two brief passages that illustrate these different and sometimes dangerous terrains. &nbsp; <br /><br />In my work on behalf of religious freedom, I have the great privilege of fighting on behalf of remarkable men and women who, in matters of conscience and belief, have the same commitment to integrity as Bolt's Thomas More. They too believe that they hold their own selves in their own hands, and not even for the sake of their freedom or safety are they willing to open their fingers. &nbsp; <br /><br />I'd like to close with a story I think beautifully illustrates the profound connections between religious freedom and all the other precious rights we cherish. John Wycliffe, the English philosopher, theologian, reformer, and preacher, undertook to translate the Bible from the Latin Vulgate into the common vernacular in the late 1300s, and he did so in the face of enormous opposition and even persecution from the ecclesiastical authorities of his day. Despite all, he persisted in this mission, and when his work was done, he wrote the following words in the flyleaf of that first Bible: "The translation is complete and shall make possible, government of the people, by the people and for the people." We associate those immortal words with President Lincoln on the occasion of the Gettysburg Address, but they have a more ancient patrimony. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now, we cannot know precisely what Wycliffe meant when he wrote those words, but I believe he was illuminating for all of us the profound insight that when men and women are free to pursue and understand truth for themselves, they become empowered to build societies that honor the claims of conscience and the fundamental liberties of all people. &nbsp; <br /><br />And so, as I close, I return to the question that I intended to ask of God: What will be the great moral challenge of my life and your life? Perhaps it will be to defend this essential human right, and it is my hope and my prayer that we will be equal to it. &nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Pre-devotional Discussion:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. It is a privilege to be here today, to speak to you. I pray for the Spirit to be with us as I try to convey my message, and also that our hearts will be opened to receiving it and in the spirit in which I am intending to deliver it.<br /><br /> Today, I would like to address a particular topic that we often hear about, but perhaps there are elements of it that we don't consider. I wish to speak about the topic of integrity. When you think about integrity, what comes to your mind? The Merriam-Webster dictionary (Webster being a very distant relation to myself, I might add), defines it as (1) a firm adherence to a code of especially moral or artistic values, (2) an unimpaired condition, or (3) the quality or state of being complete or undivided.<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> <br /><br />Embedded in the overarching topic of integrity are foundational subtopics that are so interconnected that it would be impossible to ignore them. I am talking about topics such as honesty, obedience, commitment, and loyalty. <br /><br />To illustrate an element of my topic today, I would like to share an experience that I had many years ago as a young man serving in the military. I enlisted when I was 17 years old, right out of high school. I was so young I only had to shave maybe once a week. Looking back 30 years I can say that during that time, I had many experiences that were formative in shaping my future. One such experience took place while I served as a crew member on an M109 self-propelled howitzer. Essentially, it is a large cannon on tracks. The primary purpose for that piece of equipment is meant to be very destructive, and it is.<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> Perhaps there are those of you who have served in field artillery who can relate to this experience. I was used to being on the sending end of an unforgiving kind of business, where we would fire high-explosive rounds that weighed approximately 100 pounds to the distance of anywhere from only a few hundred yards to many miles away. The distance the shell was sent was determined by many factors. The first factor consisted of the amount of gunpowder that was placed behind the shell in the barrel, or the "tube," as we called it. The powder would come premeasured and in large bags that were placed in canisters. Each canister had the same number of bags in it, but we were instructed as to how many we should use for a particular firing mission. The angle of the tube had a major effect on the distance. Those of you who may be physics majors would likely know something about this. We had to consider factors relating to the weather, such as wind, rain, as well as how smoothly the shell would fly through the air (whether it would catch and tumble or spin). Any type of friction could throw it off target. Again, mistakes could be very unforgiving. When we were given the order to fire a round someplace, we were also instructed to adjust the "gun," as it was called, either right or left or up and down a certain number of millimeters; and then, when told to do so, we simply pulled a string called a lanyard, there would be a loud boom, the ground would become unstable under our feet, and we would wait for further orders. What's the harm in pulling a little string, one might ask, or being off target one millimeter? One day I had the opportunity to observe where the rounds would hit. We drove to the side of a mountain where the forward observers were located. They were the soldiers whose job it was to observe where the explosives hit and then relay information back to the gun line and instruct us how and where to adjust our firing. Interestingly, we were far more accurate at hitting the targets that we could not see as opposed to those that we could see, because of the help of the observers who would direct our fire. Brothers and sisters, I had never seen the "other end" of what we were doing back at the gun line. That was my first exposure to that part of the experience. We have all seen similar things on television, movies, and in pictures, but nothing can describe the sights, sounds, and smells. The unique burning-sulfur aroma of the gunpowder is something I will never forget. The destructive power is difficult to describe, especially if you can imagine as many as 24 rounds being shot simultaneously into an area. We needed to do our job correctly, paying attention to detail and listening for proper feedback. Another vantage point gave me a very different perspective about the work that we were involved in, and it intensified my own efforts to improve. <br /><br />I have thought about that experience many times over the years. How often are we involved in thinking about or doing something yet not really giving it much thought as to the consequences of our decisions or the impact that it may have on ourselves or someone else? What are the forces or who are the people in our lives that impact our thoughts and subsequent behaviors? Are the things that we think about congruent, or synonymous, with our actions? The author Leon R. Hartshorn once said that "a man's true greatness is not in what he says he is, nor in what people say he is; but really, in what he really is."<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a> <br /><br />My question for you is "Who are you, really?" <br /><br />Recently I posed the question on I-Learn: "Can you foresee a time in the future when your children ask you pointed questions about your life as a young adult? Will you be able to answer them with honesty and gratitude for the choices that you are making now? What experiences will you tell them about? I noticed some great comments on the discussion board. I have asked two of your fellow classmates, Aubrey Calvert and Stefano Cena, to join me on the stand to share their remarks. <br /><br />WEBSTER: Aubrey, where are you from, and what is your major? <br /><br />CALVERT: I'm from Vancouver, Canada, and my major is elementary education. <br /><br />WEBSTER: Very good. Would you please share your thoughts that you posted on I-Learn? <br /><br />CALVERT: I really appreciated this opportunity to answer the question, because it made me reflect a lot on the way that I was raised by my own parents. And I definitely have made mistakes in my life that I may not be proud of, but I've learned from them. The most important thing that my parents taught me, that I would want to teach my children, is about the Atonement of Jesus Christ, that it's real and that it works. It makes up for your weaknesses. And thinking about that and how I want to be that example to my children makes me want to make righteous decisions today that I can be proud of in the future. <br /><br />WEBSTER: Was it difficult to think about the questions that I posed? Was it a difficult thing to go inward and think about? <br /><br />CALVERT: Maybe looking back at some of the mistakes I made might have been a little hard, but it also reminded me of how the Atonement has worked in my life, so it was actually really rewarding. <br /><br />WEBSTER: Very good. Thank you so much for participating. Now let's have Stefano Cena join me on the stand. Stefano, where are you from, and what is your major? <br /><br />CENA: I'm from Torino, Italy, and my major is human biology. WEBSTER: Very good. I enjoyed your response to the question I posed on I-Learn. Would you mind sharing your response? <br /><br />CENA: Sure. To answer the question, I reflected back on when I was on my mission. Both my parents are converts to the Church and did not serve a mission. So while serving as a mission, I asked myself, what kind of missionary would I want my children to one day be? And that really changed my attitude toward missionary service. <br /><br />WEBSTER: And as you've thought about some of those experiences versus the experiences that you had growing up, how might that look for you in the future with your own family, your own children? <br /><br />CENA: I really hope that one day I'll be able to share with them also the mistakes that I made so that they will benefit from it and not have to do those as well, as well as the good choices that I've made. And they'll be able to learn from those. <br /><br />WEBSTER: Was it a difficult thing that I asked you to consider? <br /><br />CENA: For sure, it is. <br /><br />WEBSTER: Very good. That's good. That helps you grow, right? <br /><br />CENA: It does. <br /><br />WEBSTER: Thank you for participating. <br /><br />From this experience, I wanted to get you thinking about the connectivity between your decisions now and how they may affect you and your family in the future. I hope that you have been able to do some introspection as you have pondered my questions. <br /><br />The Lord expects us to live lives of integrity and to be obedient to His commandments. As members of the Church, we have so much to be grateful for. In the Doctrine and Covenants it states, "For of him unto whom much is given much is required."<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a> The gospel of Jesus Christ provides us with many blessings, but those blessings demand our personal effort and often involve risks. Perhaps it involves doing the "right" thing, or standing up for what you know is right, even when you are unlikely to benefit positively from the decision to make or do the "right" thing. We have been warned, "Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is a sin."<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a> Perhaps this involves the topic of apathy, a topic mentioned by Elder Gavarret two weeks ago, where we are indifferent to important things that are going on around us and we simply look the other way. We live in a world with shifting values. We don't have to look very far to see how the standards of the world have shifted markedly over just the past few years. Truly, if there were ever a time for us to stand strong in our commitment to exercise integrity, wouldn't it be now? <br /><br />Like many of you, I have known many individuals in my life who possess high integrity. The attribute that makes them remarkable is that they are not afraid to be "authentic," if you will, with regard to how they live their lives. Who and what they proclaim to be is who they are when no one else is watching. <br /><br />I know that life can be challenging at times. President Boyd K. Packer has taught us that we are living in enemy territory, and, in a sense, we are living in a war zone between good and evil.<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a> On the surface, it may seem like a fairly manageable task to be honest or have high integrity, but is it really? I'm referring to times when it seems like a reasonable option to overlook temporarily or even compromise our standards to achieve what we may consider to be a worthy goal--sort of the means-to-an-end scenario. Interestingly enough, I have many such conversations with students here on this campus, as well as around the world. One might ask, what is the application to my situation in the here and now? Perhaps as a student, you have been under some kind of deadline to complete an assignment. Your friend, who has taken the same class in a previous semester, offers to let you look at the assignment he previously completed for the course as an example of how it can be done. While reviewing the work that he has loaned you, you determine that you will use his work as your own without giving them credit. The "subtleness" that I referred to earlier may have more to do with the thought processes that lead you to believe that somehow it is OK to do so in the first place. Most people don't consider themselves to be inherently dishonest. Perhaps it is the belief that because you have very limited time due to other stressors, such as work and other class responsibilities, that you are justified in doing this "one little thing, just this one time." I bring this up as an example because I have had many discussions with students and other people who have gone through such a scenario and then later felt its potential impact. The impact may be felt now or in the distant future, long after the time spent at this institution. I know it is difficult to imagine ever actually completing our formal education and being able to move on, right? This is yet part of the journey. However, when making choices to compromise your own standards and subsequently your own integrity, the consequences or stakes often get higher. <br /><br />Several years ago, while serving as a bishop, an individual came to me one night who wanted to talk. I could tell his heart was very heavy. Essentially, he wanted to get something off his chest, and it was something that had occurred many years before, while he was married with a young family. When he told me about it, he also indicated that he had thought about confessing the issue to previous bishops, but he had always worried about what they would think of him. He explained that it was bothering him more than ever before. You see, he had known it was wrong at the time he had done it, but minimized it, convincing himself that because it was not a widespread, ongoing thing that he had done, it could be "brushed off." This brother had served faithfully in the Church and was a wonderful husband and father. However, over the years, he had never forgotten his actions, and his recollection of it was like a ball and chain that he had carried around all those years. Are we more concerned about what others might think of us when making decisions in our lives, and does it impact our ability to choose the right? Are we considerate enough to ourselves to be honest with ourselves? Are there things in our life that we justify because it is a "little thing" but, if we are to be completely honest with ourselves, we may need to forsake them, confess, and apply the Atonement so that we truthfully can say we are honest and possess integrity? In the case of this good man, he had justified his actions, but in fact he knew it was wrong and sought to deny what he already knew to be true. <br /><br />There are many circumstances that demand our attention to detail with regard to the topic of integrity. In my ongoing discussions with students here on this campus and around the world, the topic of appropriate or inappropriate behavior is centered around the topic of obedience. I have found it impossible to avoid discussions about sin and wrongdoing without the topic of obedience coming up. In the New Testament, the&nbsp;<br />Lord stated, "And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?"<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a> Do we expect to enjoy the companionship of the Holy Ghost without being worthy of it? On another occasion, he said, "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven."<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[viii]</a> We are instructed to be obedient in all things, according to His will. <br /><br />The other night, I was sitting in the temple, thinking about the level of obedience that was displayed by Adam and Eve as they left the Garden of Eden, even though they did not fully understand their purposes or where they would be going. After they had left the garden, an angel appeared to Adam and asked, "Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord?" Adam said, "I know not, save the Lord commanded me."<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[ix]</a> Are there things we are asked to do in this life that we do not understand? The probability of such occurrences is very high, brothers and sisters, as you have probably experienced. Sometimes we must act in faith. For a local adaptation, perhaps at this university you may be living in circumstances where you do not see eye to eye with your roommates, your spouse, your employer, or your instructors. As a result, you choose to be in conflict with them and cheapen the experiences you could be having by learning about one another's positive differences and embracing them. Perhaps there are aspects of the Honor Code that we don't see clearly in the here and now, but the eternal fruits of being obedient to its contents may prepare us for times when greater obedience and adherence to higher principles is required. Are we willing to compromise our own honor and integrity by ignoring the principles in the Honor Code that we agreed to before beginning our experiences at BYU-Idaho? <br /><br />I know that many of you come from varying parts of the world, and in some cases the only similarities you may have with your classmates may be your membership in the Church and a desire to gain further knowledge. I do know that many of the challenges that we face now, during our probationary time here on earth, can be universal. I am referring to many of the human foibles that we so often succumb to in our mortal existence. &nbsp; <br /><br />I can recall an interesting experience I had while serving as a full-time missionary in Texas. My companion and I met and began to teach a man who worked at an air force base and had an interesting job working on military jets. On one of our preparation days, he invited us to the air force base where he worked to show us part of what his job entailed. His responsibility was to inspect the jet engines to see how they would perform on the ground revved up and at full operation. He then proceeded to bolt and chain the jet to the ground to prevent it from flying into the adjacent building. I want you to imagine that scenario. We stood probably 10 to 15 feet from the jet as he started it and then opened up the engine full-blast to see how the engine would perform as part of a routine testing procedure. Our friend then crawled underneath the jet during full operation to inspect various components. It was probably the loudest thing I had ever heard, and I had heard some very loud things myself while in the army. Obviously, we wore hearing protection, but that was our only protection. It was an awesome sight, to say the least. I kept thinking to myself, "Chains, please hold!" I can recall watching those chains restrain the power of that jet, which, on its own, would have easily flown forward, causing much damage. The only thing preventing the jet from going well over the speed of sound were those restraints. <br /><br />To draw a parallel, what "chains" prevent us from destruction in our own lives? Do the chains keep us from doing things we shouldn't be doing, or are they keeping us from things we should be doing? I want you to think about that for a second. Are there chains that are keeping you from doing or not doing certain things? Perhaps we have addictions that ensnare us in a way that is difficult to escape. Much of my professional work has involved working as a licensed clinical counselor for almost 20 years and in a variety of settings. I have witnessed how various circumstances can lead people to make choices that initially may actually seem like an acceptable way to deal with or escape their reality or to enhance their progression. Often they realize they are caught in a deceitful web, and they don't know how to get out. At times, I meet with people who are "coasting" through life, not really knowing from day to day what their true purpose is. To those who may be experiencing any of those circumstances, part of my message today is that you are not alone and that there are resources to help you. <br /><br />In preparation for teaching a Gospel Doctrine lesson on the topic of consecration, I researched a very interesting talk by Elder D. Todd Christofferson.<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[x]</a> In preparation for teaching the lesson, I learned that the term <em>consecration</em> refers to dedicating many elements of our life to God and our fellowmen and includes the following topics: purity, work, respect for one's physical body, service, and integrity. An important element to consider as well is repentance, which involves abandoning stubbornness, rebellion, and rationalization. King Benjamin referred to this as putting off the natural man, yielding to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and becoming a "saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord."<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[xi]</a> As we strive to align our lives within the confines of the gospel, we are promised the companionship of the Holy Spirit, a promise that is renewed every time we partake of the sacrament worthily.<a href="/devotionals/creed-webster#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[xii]</a> As we strive to be obedient to the laws of the gospel, are we allowing the commandments, the "chains of the gospel," to keep us safely on the Lord's path? As I have reflected on this question, my own interpretation has been expanded. I suggest that integrity has more to do with how we really are as opposed to how we allow others to see us. It is about our personal commitment to obey the commandments and be loyal followers of Christ, even when times are tough. <br /><br />During our time together today, it has been my prayer that each of us can do some personal introspection and try to improve those areas of our lives that may be preventing us from enjoying the full blessings of integrity. I know that Heavenly Father loves us and knows each of our challenges, and that through His help and the influence of the Holy Ghost, we can be strengthened in that effort. <br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>University Resources Vice President</p>
<p>Jeff Morrin came to BYU-Idaho in 2014 to teach finance in the business department. That changed last summer when he was appointed vice president of University Resources. Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho, he spent 19 years working in finance in the business world.&nbsp; He earned a bachelor's degree in Business Management as well as an MBA from BYU.</p>
<p>Brother Morrin has held many callings in the church.&nbsp; He currently serves as the high priest group leader in his ward.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />He and his wife, Laura, are the parents of six children. This spring they happily added two daughters-in-law to their family.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">We invite you to study and ponder on the scriptures and other preparation resources below previous to attending devotional. As you come more spiritually prepared the Spirit will have greater power to inspire you, teach you, and to testify to you of the truthfulness of the principles that will be taught.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Pre-devotional Discussion:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our family is so blessed to be permitted to be at BYU-Idaho. It is truly a gift. I love this university and its mission. I love the Spirit that is here. I love the people with whom I have worked, both in the business department, where I began teaching, as well as the many people all across campus in my current role. I love the many students whom I have taught. My family and I have had many of you in our home for family home evening, dinner, general conference, homework sessions, preparing for job interviews, and carving a pumpkin for the first time. I even have a former student who is now a daughter-in-law. <br /><br /> I have thought about the topic of finishing for a long time. Over the past many months, I have had many thoughts and examples of what I could share with you. In fact, it was way more than we have time today. I actually became somewhat discouraged knowing that I couldn't share everything with you. However, I was comforted knowing that, for those who have ears to hear and eyes to see and hearts to feel, the Spirit will help each of you to hear, see, and feel what the Lord wants you to hear, see, and feel, regardless of what I may or may not say. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />In the April 1972 general conference, then Elder Thomas S. Monson shared the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On sunlit days during the noon hour, the streets of Salt Lake City abound with men and women who for a moment leave the confines of the tall office buildings and engage in that universal delight called window shopping. On occasion I, too, am a participant. <br /><br />One Wednesday I paused before the elegant show window of a prestigious furniture store. That which caught and held my attention was not the beautifully designed sofa nor the comfortable-appearing chair that stood at its side. Neither was it the beautiful chandelier positioned overhead. Rather, my eyes rested upon a small sign that had been placed at the bottom right-hand corner of the window. Its message was brief: "Finishers Wanted."</p>
<p>President Monson continues,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The store had need of those persons who possessed the talent and the skill to make ready for final sale the expensive furniture that the firm manufactured and sold. "Finishers Wanted." The words remained with me as I returned to the pressing activities of the day.</p>
<p>President Monson concludes,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In life, as in business, there has always been a need for those persons who could be called finishers. Their ranks are few, their opportunities many, their contributions great. (Thomas S. Monson, "Finishers Wanted," <em>Ensign, </em>July 1972)</p>
<p>Today I would like to talk with each of you about the importance of being a finisher. I suspect that even at this very moment, there are some of you who are contemplating whether or not you are going to be a finisher. You may be considering whether or not you are going to finish something as seemingly insignificant as that homework assignment you've been procrastinating for the past few days. You may be facing a decision of whether or not you are going to honor baptismal or temple covenants in spite of temptations and trials that confront you. You may feel as though you have been tossed to and fro in the storms of life that oftentimes come unannounced, storms which seem to relentlessly come down upon you, causing you to desperately seek for breath in between the crashing waves as you strive to press forward amidst the dark and gloomy nights with no immediate end in sight. Whatever you may be facing, some of you have made that determination to press forward, while others may have already prematurely admitted defeat. <br /><br />I would like to share with you a few quotes that, for me, help define finishing. These quotes may describe it as grit, endurance, perseverance, or finishing, but all describe the same concept of being a finisher. <br /><br />Angela Duckworth, in her book <em>Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance</em>, stated, "Grit specifies having a passion to accomplish a particular top-level goal <em>and</em> the perseverance to follow through. Enthusiasm is common. Endurance is rare" (Angela Duckworth, <em>Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance</em>, 2016, 250). Let me repeat the last part. "Enthusiasm is common. Endurance is rare." <br /><br />Angela Duckworth also wrote in the same book, "Grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low-level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher-level goals that demand more tenacity" (Angela Duckworth, <em>Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance</em>, 2016, 86). <br /><br />Concerning those who fall short, John Greenleaf Whittier's words seem particularly fitting: "For of all sad words of tongue or pen, / The saddest are these: 'It might have been!'" (John Greenleaf Whittier, "Maud Muller"). <br /><br />Lastly, Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin shared the following from the <em>Second Encyclopedia</em> in his October 1987 general conference talk:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Genius is only the power of making continuous efforts. The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it; so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it. How many a man has thrown up his hands at a time when a little more effort, a little more patience would have achieved success? A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed a hopeless failure may turn into a glorious success.... There is no defeat except within, no really insurmountable barrier save one's own inherent weakness of purpose. (Author unknown, <em>Second Encyclopedia</em>, ed. Jacob M. Brand, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1957, 152)</p>
<p>Which side of the line are you on? Will you even recognize when you are on that fine line between success and failure? Will you be a finisher? <br /><br />There may be several different reasons why we don't finish. These could include discouragement, distraction, procrastination, "it's too hard," "it's too easy," lack of importance, fear of failure, lack of interest, or lack of organization. <br /><br />I would like to focus briefly on just two of these reasons. First, discouragement. Elder John H. Groberg said, "Satan and his forces (the world) will do everything in their power to have you lose hope--to be constantly down on yourself, always discouraged, despondent, etc.... Satan wants to discourage you, for he knows discouragement and hope cannot exist together. So if he gets you discouraged enough, out goes hope." <br /><br />Elder Groberg continued, "On the other hand, the Savior will do just the opposite. He will do all in his power to encourage you, lift you up, give you hope, help you in every way possible, so that with a 'steadfastness in Christ' we may attain to that 'perfect brightness of hope' and then discouragement and despair are gone" (John H. Groberg, "There is Always Hope," June 3, 1984, Brigham Young University). <br /><br />Next, distraction. Elder Richard G. Scott said the following in the April 2001 general conference, "When things of the world crowd in, all too often the wrong things take highest priority. Then it is easy to forget the fundamental purpose of life. Satan has a powerful tool to use against good people. It is distraction. He would have good people fill life with 'good things' so there is no room for the essential ones. Have you unconsciously been caught in that trap?" (Richard G. Scott, "First Things First," <em>Ensign, </em>Apr. 2001). I ask each of you a similar question. Have you allowed the distraction of good things in your life to crowd out the essential? <br /><br />This past week, I invited you to respond to the following two items on the discussion board. First, why is finishing (e.g. enduring, persevering) important? Next, I asked you to share a time in your life when you were able to "finish" something even when faced with obstacles. I really appreciated reading everything that many of you shared, and I wish we had time to have you all come up and share your thoughts. However, there is only time to have one of you share your thoughts. I have invited Clayton Brassfield to join me at the podium. <br /><br />MORRIN: Clayton, why don't you introduce yourself. This may be the one and only time to do this here. Introduce yourself--where you're from and what you're studying. <br /><br />BRASSFIELD: My name is Clayton Brassfield. I'm from Colville, Washington, and I'm studying psychology. <br /><br />MORRIN: And he's also engaged to be married soon. So, Clayton, I really appreciated what you shared on the discussion board. Would you mind sharing with us your experience? <br /><br />BRASSFIELD: So when I returned home from my mission, the very first job that I had was at a lumber mill. And working at the lumber mill was a lot different than any job I'd ever had. It was a lot harder, and I had no experience. When I first started, I was really, really terrible at my job. I had a lot of times where I just wanted to give up, because I knew that the guys that I worked with didn't like me because I was so bad. I knew that if I didn't get better, I could lose my job. One thing that always helped me to persevere and to finish this job and not quit when I wanted to or when I had other opportunities for other jobs was asking myself the question of how I could expect my future children to persevere in hard things when I couldn't do it myself. And when I thought about that, it helped me to continue on, and I eventually became really good at my job and became one of the best employees that they had. And now when I'm off track or not at school, they allow me to come back and work, even if it's just for a week at a time. <br /><br />MORRIN: Thank you, Clayton. Like I shared with you earlier, I really appreciated the long-term perspective you had when you were trying to figure out what you were going to do and if you were going to continue in this job that was really hard at the time, that you looked forward to the future and considered your own future family. So thank you for sharing that. <br /><br />I'd now like to give all of you the opportunity to share with a neighbor a time in your life when you felt you were a finisher. Please take 60 seconds to share an experience with your neighbor. <br /><br />May those who shared your experiences on the discussion board, as well as all of you who have shared an experience with your neighbor, remember how you were a finisher and use that experience to help you when you need additional strength to finish. <br /><br />Each of you will be faced with situations that will require you to choose whether or not you will be a finisher. I would like to share with you a few examples of individuals who were finishers in various aspects of life. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Jenny's Experience</strong><br />All of you who are students need to decide daily if you are going to be a finisher as it relates to your studies. I'd like to share with you an experience of one of my former students. I'll call this student Jenny (not her real name). I share this experience with her permission. <br /><br />Jenny had a hard year with family and school. She was a convert to the Church of a few years and the only member in her family. She didn't feel much support from home. Also, she struggled with roommates and began to question if she should even be at BYU-Idaho. Life was hard. <br /><br />One particular week, Jenny was struggling from lack of sleep due to many hours of studying. As a result, she fell asleep early Friday evening and then woke up briefly, only to fall asleep again until later Saturday morning. At this point, she realized that she missed submitting her homework for my class. <br /><br />Jenny soon e-mailed me the following: "Hi, Brother Morrin. I woke up this morning and realized that I completely forgot to do the two assignments due last night. I was wondering if there is any way that I can make these up. I'm sorry about forgetting about them!" <br /><br />I replied, "Jenny, I was sorry to see your e-mail. Once an assignment is past due, you are not able to submit it." I then gave her some advice on future assignments and then wrote, "Please let me know if you have any other questions." <br /><br />Our communication continued on Monday, as Jenny wrote: "Hi, Brother Morrin. I was looking into my grade, and I have noticed that from missing these assignments my grade has dropped 17 percent. I am debating whether or not I should stay in the course. Thanks for your help." <br /><br />Jenny felt she was in a bad place spiritually and was insecure about herself and her future. <br /><br />Jenny and I soon met, and I could tell she was distraught. I told her that even though she wouldn't be able to fully recover her grade, she could still do well in the class and learn what she was supposed to learn. I strongly encouraged her to stick it out. Jenny did stay in the course and did learn what she was supposed to learn. She was a very diligent student. She even ended up earning a decent grade considering her original dilemma.&nbsp; <br /><br />Later, after the semester, I spoke with Jenny more about her experience. She said: "I knew deep down I wasn't going to drop [the class] and get a 'W.' [I knew] if I just put everything into the course, it would be OK." She also gave me her philosophy on finishing. She said, "I never want someone to think [that I] gave up." No matter what happens, you are better off if you apply yourself and trust in the Lord and do the best you can. <br /><br />Not only does being a finisher make a difference in school, but it also makes a big difference in the workplace. In fact, the ability to be disciplined in finishing tasks is something that many companies look for in potential job candidates. <br /><br />In his book <em>There Is Life After College</em>, Jeffrey J. Selingo draws on the words of the author that I previously quoted when he writes, "Call it 'grit'--a term used by Angela Duckworth, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research has found that the most successful people are those not only with self-discipline but also with a singular determination to accomplish a task, no matter the obstacles. It's the deep passion Adam Ward at Pinterest told me his company looks for in employees" (Jeffrey J. Selingo, <em>There is Life After College: What Parents and Students Should Know About Navigating School to Prepare for the Jobs of Tomorrow</em>, 2016, 47). <br /><br />Many of the best employees who worked for me in the business world were people whom I would consider finishers. When given an assignment, they would always finish it--oftentimes better than I imagined. They would usually come back to clarify things or to counsel on the best approach to take in finishing the assignment, but they would almost always finish the assignment as expected and rarely use excuses for not completing the assignment. <br /><br />Next, I would like to ask my wife, Laura, to join me here at the podium. She can express this next experience much better than I could. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Laura's Dad</strong><br />LAURA: I am grateful for just a moment to share with you a meaningful story of finishing in my life. I have to briefly begin at the beginning of my life. I was born to goodly parents, just like Nephi. My dad, a veteran of the Vietnam War, and a police officer, saw much of the ugliness the world has to offer. In 1976 he joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, when I was five years old. His decision, coupled with my desire to know our Heavenly Father, would change both of our lives, but not at the same time. Life took its toll on my dad, and he found himself outside of the Church off and on for many years. I was married to my sweet husband in 1991 in the Los Angeles Temple. It was a day I had prepared for and longed for all my life. However, it was a day that I broke my dad's heart. My dad had been my hero and the one I most wanted to please, but he had not been ready to make sacred covenants. As a result, my dad couldn't witness our marriage. <br /><br />Fast-forward twenty-five years. All those years, I strived to be an example. I shared my testimony, I followed through on promptings, I made my share of mistakes, and I felt like much of it fell on deaf ears. However, on November 6, 2016, about 10 a.m., my phone rang. My dad, whom I have only seen cry once, was emotional and told me that he was holding a temple recommend. I wish I had time to tell you all that I was feeling. On Friday, November 25, 2016, in the Denver Colorado Temple, I witnessed my dad and mom being sealed, and then I knelt and was sealed to them. All our children were there except our son, who is serving a mission in Brazil. I asked my dad what made the difference, and he said, "I told the bishop that I think it is time." I might never know all the steps that helped my dad take that step to finish, in a sense, his conversion. <br /><br />I testify to you the reality of the Atonement of Jesus Christ in each of our lives, and the reality of change. I have witnessed it firsthand in myself and in the miracle of my dad. Recently, in two temples, I watched my dad serve as an escort to our sons as they were married to their sweethearts. As much as I wanted my dad to be there with me when I was married, my joy was so full those days, and it more than made up for his absence twenty-six years ago. How I love my dad. There is power in finishing the covenants we need to make here in mortality. <br /><br />MORRIN: Thank you, Laura. I am also very grateful that you and several others never gave up and that we were all able to be in the temple last November. <br /><br />Oftentimes we fail to recognize that it isn't simply the big things in life that matter; it is also the cumulative effect of consistently finishing the small things that leads to our eternal destiny. <br /><br />Charles A. Hall described the following: "We sow our thoughts, and we reap our actions; we sow our actions, and we reap our habits; we sow our habits, and we reap our characters; we sow our characters, and we reap our destiny" (<em>The Home Book of Quotations</em>, sel. Burton Stevenson, 1934, 845). <br /><br />So it is with finishing. As we decide whether or not we will finish something, great or small, and as we act upon those thoughts, and as we develop a habit of finishing, it will ultimately determine our character--one known as a finisher, which will help lead us to our destiny of life eternal. <br /><br />These patterns of finishing, similar to other patterns that we establish in our lives, such as daily prayer, scripture study, family home evening, temple attendance, and weekly date night with our spouse, will help protect us from the influence of the adversary and help secure eternal life. <br /><br />In 2 Nephi 31, Nephi writes about the doctrine of Christ, including the importance of enduring to the end. "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life" (2 Nephi 31:20). <br /><br />That is part of the doctrine of Christ: to endure to the end, to persevere, to finish. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Christ Is the Ultimate Example of a Finisher</strong><br />Let's discuss briefly about the ultimate finisher: Christ. There were many times when Christ chose to be a finisher during His earthly mission. Let's review a few of those instances. <br /><br />At the beginning of His earthly ministry, Jesus fasted for 40 days and 40 nights. Then came Satan tempting Him. First, he appealed to Jesus's hunger by asking Him to transform stones into bread. Jesus responded, "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4). Next, Satan tempted Him to misuse His divine power by taking Him to a pinnacle of the temple. There Satan told Jesus to cast Himself down and, if He were the son of God, angels would protect Him. Jesus responded, "It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God" (Matthew 4:7). Finally, Satan took Jesus to an exceedingly high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. Then Satan said, "All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me" (Matthew 4:9). Jesus responded, "Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve" (Matthew 4:10). In this encounter with Satan, Jesus was able to persevere in the face of temptation. &nbsp; <br /><br />Toward the end of His mortal ministry, Jesus had to endure much in the Garden of Gethsemane as He faced the final acts of finishing our salvation. <br /><br />Neal A. Maxwell provided insight into the Savior's suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane when he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In Gethsemane, the suffering Jesus began to be "sore amazed" (Mark 14:33), or, in the Greek, "awestruck" and "astonished." <br /><br />Imagine, Jehovah, the Creator of this and other worlds, "astonished"! Jesus knew cognitively what He must do, but not experientially. He had never personally known the exquisite and exacting process of an atonement before. Thus, when the agony came in its fulness, it was so much, much worse than even He with his unique intellect had ever imagined! No wonder an angel appeared to strengthen him! (See Luke 22:43.) <br /><br />The cumulative weight of all mortal sins--past, present, and future--pressed upon that perfect, sinless, and sensitive Soul! All our infirmities and sicknesses were somehow, too, a part of the awful arithmetic of the Atonement. (See Alma 7:11-12; Isa. 53:3-5; Matt. 8:17) The anguished Jesus not only pled with the Father that the hour and cup might pass from Him, but with this relevant citation. "And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me" (Mark 14:35-36). (Neal A. Maxwell, "Willing to Submit," <em>Ensign,</em> May 1985)</p>
<p>How easy it could have been for Jesus to have given up at this point and not have finished the work of His Father! However, He knew His mission, He loved us, and He carried on. <br /><br />Jesus then endured unlawful trials before Jewish and Roman leaders. He was mocked. At Pilate's direction, Jesus was flogged. Roman soldiers insulted Jesus as they placed the thorny crown upon His head. Still weary from all the floggings and injustice, Jesus carried His own cross to the place called Golgotha. It was there that they crucified Him. During the intense agony of dying on the cross, it appears that God the Father left His Son's presence. Jesus, sensing that His father had left, "cried with a loud voice, ... My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34). Soon after that, Jesus said, "It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost" (John 19:30). Even after His death, Jesus went to the spirit world and preached the gospel to those who were dead, "that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit" (1 Peter 4:6). Through all that Jesus suffered and endured, He became "the author and finisher of our faith" (Hebrews 12:2; see also Moroni 6:4). Christ is our great Exemplar. He finished the work of His Father on this earth and even now continues His Father's work that we might have the opportunity to enjoy eternal life, or, in other words, the life that our Father in Heaven enjoys. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Conclusion</strong><a><br /></a></p>
<p>As demonstrated in&nbsp;President Monson's story of the message in the furniture-store window, the Lord needs each of us to be finishers.<a> </a><a href="/devotionals/jeff-morrin#_msocom_1" id="_anchor_1" name="_msoanchor_1">[M1]</a>&nbsp;He needs us to be finishers in the seemingly routine activities of our daily lives. He needs us to be finishers when He asks us to do some really hard things. He especially needs us to be finishers as we progress through this life and endure to the end toward eternal life with Him and with those we love. <br /><br />Even though I have talked mainly about the importance of being a finisher, I also hope that each of you has felt the immense love that our Heavenly Father has for you. "For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). Also, I hope you have felt the love that our Savior has for you in voluntarily giving His life as He became the author and finisher of our salvation. Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ love each of you and want you to be finishers and become the people They know you can become. I invite each of you to become the finishers that God wants you to become and thus, through Christ, obtain eternal life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>
<p></p>

<p><a href="/devotionals/jeff-morrin#_msoanchor_1">[M1]</a>There's some disagreement here between the independent clause and the phrase preceding it (attributing "similar" to "the Lord"), and I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to change it.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Try to imagine yourself in the nation's capital, meeting in the Oval Office with the president of the United States. The president has your bio in front of him and sees that you are a Latter-day Saint. He asks you, "How is your church different from other churches in our country?" What would you say? How would you answer him?<br /><br /> Many years ago, in 1839, Joseph Smith traveled to Washington D.C. and met with Martin Van Buren, the president of the United States. The men engaged in a long conversation, and at one point President Van Buren posed the same question to Joseph: "How does your church differ from the other religions of the day?" <br /><br />Joseph's answer was surprisingly simple. He explained, "We differ in the mode of baptism, and in the Gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands." Joseph concluded that all other considerations are contained in the gift of the Holy Ghost (<em>HC </em>4:42). <br /><br />President Van Buren was no doubt familiar with the New Testament, so he must have realized that the gift of the Holy Ghost was the very same gift and power that the early Christians once enjoyed. It made possible all the spiritual gifts that Paul described in his letter to the Corinthians, gifts like wisdom and knowledge and charity<em> </em>(1 Corinthians 12:5-11). <br /><br />Do you and I fully appreciate what it means to have the gift of the Holy Ghost? Not only can we invite a member of the Godhead to be our personal companion, but, if we are worthy, receiving the Holy Ghost is accompanied by at least one customized spiritual gift. (D&amp;C 46:11) This way, every member of the Church can better contribute to the kingdom. <br /><br />Without priesthood authority, the gift of the Holy Ghost could not be bestowed. We would be like any other church on earth. With the help of spiritual gifts, Latter-day Saints have increased confidence to accept callings, teach classes, speak in meetings, give priesthood blessings, serve missions, or learn foreign languages. This direct access to heavenly power enables the "lay ministry" of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to succeed. &nbsp; <br /><br />The Lord really wants us to appreciate the precious gifts of the Spirit--to understand that they are far more valuable than material gifts. Let me share a story in the Old Testament to illustrate: When King David died, his son Solomon inherited the throne. Scholars estimate that Solomon was only around 20 years of age at the time. The young king was completely humbled by his new responsibility as chief of state. <br /><br />One night, while Solomon was sleeping, the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Ask what I shall give thee." What an opportunity! The Lord was offering him the wish of his heart! Solomon could have asked for riches or for honor or for a long life. He could have asked for power over his enemies. But as you may remember, young king Solomon asked for a spiritual gift--for "[a wise and] an understanding heart to judge [the] people." This request pleased God so much that he not only agreed to bless Solomon with great wisdom but with all those other blessings that he might have asked for as well (1 Kings 3:5-14). <br /><br />Wisdom is a valuable spiritual gift, and the Lord is happy when we seek it. In the epistle of James, we read, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God" (James 1:5). This counsel applies to all the gifts of the Spirit; we are invited to ask God for any that we lack. We can ask for faith, for discernment, for personal revelation--for any spiritual gift. <br /><br />Heavenly Father is much more generous than most of His children realize. He is never annoyed at us for asking for divine help. On the contrary, He "giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not". (James 1:5) "Upbraideth not" means God won't scold us for asking. <br /><br />The scriptures teach that every worthy member is given at least one spiritual gift (D&amp;C 46:11). These personal gifts are often mentioned in our patriarchal blessings, so I would encourage each of you to review your blessing often. However, keep in mind that Church members are not limited to just one gift or to those listed in a patriarchal blessing. We can seek and ask for more--as long as we remember what the gifts are for. They are to be used for the building of the kingdom, "for the benefit of the children of God" (D&amp;C 46:26). <br /><br />Paul encouraged the early Saints to "desire" spiritual gifts and even to "covet earnestly the best gifts" (1 Corinthians 12:31). To me that means that if I notice a brother or sister who magnifies a gift of the Spirit, I am invited to seek that same gift myself. This is the only place in the scriptures where we are actually instructed to "covet." If you have a roommate, a sibling, a mission companion, or a spouse who really seems to understand the scriptures, you can covet that gift yourself and then ask for it. <br /><br />I sometimes visualize a large storehouse up in heaven, completely filled with spiritual gifts, available to all Saints who have the faith to ask for them. Unfortunately, not too many are asking, so the storehouse is always overstocked.</p>
<p><img alt="Store House" height="175" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring%202017/Graphics/Store-House_300x175.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>The prophet Moroni taught that three of these gifts (faith, hope, and charity) are necessary for exaltation (Moroni 10:20-22). He explained that the greatest of all the gifts is charity, or the pure love of Christ. Is it presumptuous to ask the Lord for charity? Not at all! Mormon challenged us to "pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love" (Moroni 7:48). <br /><br />My wife and I have a friend who took this challenge to heart. Later, she wrote about her experience and described how she was forever changed by it. She wrote: "I have been praying specifically for an increase of charity for several months. I have prayed daily, out loud, several times a day, for this important gift. Gradually my perception of others has changed: it seems as if I had been watching people on a little old black-and-white television for all these years. Now I am seeing them in 3D on a plasma HD big-screen TV. I have begun to not just love the people around me but to enjoy them. Before, I may have kept my distance, but now I am genuinely interested in everyone." <br /><br />In the New Testament, and also in the Doctrine of Covenants, many useful spiritual gifts are listed. Among these are the "faith to heal" and the "faith to be healed," the "working of miracles," the gift of prophecy, the gift of tongues, and the gift of discernment. In the Book of Mormon, others are added to the list, including the gift to teach and "the beholding of angels and ministering spirits" (1 Corinthians 12; D&amp;C 46; Moroni 10). <br /><br />Several years ago, Apostle Marvin J. Ashton spoke about spiritual gifts at general conference. He explained that there were many more gifts available to the Saints than those which are listed in the scriptures. He cited several other gifts for us to consider, including "the gift of asking; the gift of listening; ... the gift of avoiding contention; the gift of being agreeable," the gift to calm others, and the gift to care (Marvin J. Ashton, "There Are Many Gifts," <em>Ensign, </em>Nov. 1987). Brothers and sisters, the list is "endless in number and infinite in variety" (Bruce R. McConkie, <em>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</em>, 371). <br /><br />As you search the scriptures, you will discover that Saints in every dispensation have been blessed with marvelous gifts of the Spirit. Reading about their lives can motivate us to "desire spiritual gifts," which is exactly what the Lord wants us to do. <br /><br />For example, shortly after Adam was baptized and received the Holy Ghost, he was given the "gift of prophecy." As a result, he "began to prophecy concerning all the families of the earth" (Moses 5:10). Later we read about Enoch, a man who was blessed with the faith to perform miracles. At his word, the earth trembled, the mountains fled, and rivers were turned out of their course (Moses 6:34). <br /><br />Abraham was also known for his unwavering faith. Faith is a spiritual gift that we can ask for. Abraham's wife, Sarah, was blessed with the gift of patience. She waited patiently on the Lord until she was past 90 years old before her only son, Isaac, was finally born. Another righteous woman mentioned in the Old Testament was Ruth, a convert to the gospel. She was blessed with the gift of loyalty. Ruth set an example for us all by her loyal devotion to her mother-in-law. <br /><br />In the New Testament, we are introduced to Joseph the carpenter. Joseph received the gift of dreams to help guide his personal decisions. Following instructions given in a dream, he took Mary to be his wife. Later, he received a dream warning him to take his young family and flee to Egypt (Matt. 1:20-25). The gift of dreams is given to many faithful Saints in our own day. <br /><br />The apostle Peter was blessed with the gift of healing. Believers would bring their sick into the streets on beds and couches, hoping that the mere shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow their loved ones and heal them (Acts 5:15). <br /><br />The Book of Mormon is full of examples of righteous Saints who used their spiritual gifts to build the kingdom. The brother of Jared enjoyed the gift of asking and was never afraid to ask the Lord for what he desired (Ether 1:43). <br /><br />And what about the prophet Mormon--what spiritual gifts did he receive? Among other things, we are told that he was "quick to observe" (Mormon 1:2). This helped him to learn from the mistakes of others and to remain righteous in the midst of a wicked generation. <br /><br />Alma the Senior enjoyed the gift of recall. In other words, he could remember words of truth long after he had heard them. After listening to Abinadi's powerful testimony, Alma was able to recall the prophet's exact words from memory. He then took the time to record these precious teachings while he was hiding out from the wicked King Noah (Mosiah 17:4). <br /><br />In our own dispensation, Wilford Woodruff was blessed with the same valuable gift. Because he magnified his gift, many of the Prophet Joseph's sermons are available to us today. <br /><br />Brother Woodruff explained: "Whenever I heard Joseph Smith preach, teach, or prophesy, I always felt it my duty to write it ... and when I had no pencil or paper, I would go home and sit down and write the whole sermon, almost word for word and sentence by sentence as it was delivered, and when I had written it down, then it was taken from me. I remembered it no more. This was the gift of God to me" (Matthias Cowley, <em>Wilford Woodruff: History of His Life and Labors,</em> 476-77). <br /><br />Would <em>you</em> like the gift of recall or the gift of courage or the gift of dreams? Why not ask? I testify that the Lord won't scold you for asking. Does a member have to be perfect to ask for spiritual gifts? The Lord answered that question in the scriptures. <br /><br />He explained that gifts are given for the benefit of "those who love me and keep all my commandments," and then he added, "And him that seeketh so to do" (D&amp;C 46:9). That likely includes all of us here today. <br /><br />The Lord's one stipulation is that we don't come seeking gifts for "a sign" or "to consume it upon [our] lusts" (D&amp;C 46:9). In other words, we should not be seeking gifts to build ourselves up in the eyes of others or for personal financial gain. Spiritual gifts are given to help us build the kingdom so "that all may be profited thereby" (D&amp;C 46:12).<em></em> <br /><br />Those who are called to serve as bishops are blessed with the gift of discernment. The Holy Ghost helps them to discern when someone is telling the truth and also helps them see the good in ward members. Years ago, I was preparing to set apart a newly called bishop. Before I laid my hands upon his head, he turned and asked in great humility, "President, while you are setting me apart, could you bless me with the gift of remembering names. This is a weakness of mine, and I want to improve myself. I believe this gift would help me magnify my calling." I was struck with his childlike faith. The Spirit whispered to me that the Lord was pleased with such a righteous desire. <br /><br />President George Q. Cannon, counselor to several Presidents of the Church, said, "If any of us are imperfect, it is our duty to pray for the gift that will make us perfect." Since the most important callings in the kingdom are that of mother and father, President Cannon encouraged parents to ask for spiritual gifts. He suggested to young mothers, for example, that they might ask for "the gift to govern children" or to "organize households" (George Q. Cannon, <em>Gospel Truths,</em> 156). If you want to be a better parent or spouse or roommate, there is heavenly help available. Why not ask? <br /><br />Many years ago, I served as a mission president in Russia. Our missionary team was small because of quotas imposed by the Russian government. I considered our small numbers to be a blessing, because it was easy to get to know each missionary very well. <br /><br />As the months went by, I observed that every elder and every sister in our mission was uniquely gifted. I saw firsthand how their various gifts complemented each other. No missionary possessed every gift, but each possessed at least one. There were a few missionaries who were peacemakers. They could get along with the most difficult companions and could help unify any district. There were some missionaries who were courageous, in fact fearless. They could talk to anyone, and they did--everywhere they went. Some had the gift of tongues and quickly mastered the complex Russian language. &nbsp; <br /><br />Some had the gift of creative ideas and kept the mission fresh and exciting. Several were blessed to understand and expound the scriptures. Many missionaries had the gift of making friends. Some were good listeners. Others were gifted problem solvers. Fortunately, there were a few who had a gift for organization, and they kept our mission office running smoothly. I remember a native elder from Russia, Elder Sergei Afanosov, who was blessed with a constant smile. His optimistic spirit brightened every room that he entered. From watching him, I learned how the gift of a cheerful heart can help build the kingdom in a significant way. <br /><br />Imagine for a moment that you are a child again. It's Christmas morning, and your home is filled with the spirit of the season. Christmas music is playing. Your father passes out a special gift to each member in the family. Each gift was carefully selected; each is something very useful. After the presents are received with thankfulness, your mother disappears into the kitchen to cook up something special. <br /><br />While you are enjoying this beautiful moment, you notice that there are many unopened gifts left under the Christmas tree. You can tell what's inside, because the gifts are clearly labeled. You realize that you could use some of these valuable gifts yourself. <br /><br />Reluctantly, you approach your father, not wanting to appear greedy. "Father," you ask, "whom are these other presents for?" He smiles warmly and explains, "For whoever wants one." That sounds <em>way</em> too good to be true. You think to yourself, "There must be a catch." Then your father explains, "Just ask for what you need. I won't scold you for asking."</p>
<p><img alt="Christmas Gifts" height="168" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring%202017/Graphics/Christmas-Gifts_300x168.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>This Christmas story is not as farfetched as it may seem. Jesus taught His disciples that our Father in Heaven is a very generous parent. He encouraged them, "Ask, and it shall be given [unto] you" (Luke 11:9). This phrase, encouraging us to ask, is repeated over and over in the standard works<em>. </em>Remember that God grants<em> </em>"whatsoever ye ask that is right" (Mosiah 4:21).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father is willing to give us what we need to help us progress and become like Him--and to help us build the kingdom. <br /><br />Let me share with you a personal example. I was baptized when I was a young adult, the first one in my family to join the Church. After my conversion, the Holy Ghost helped me recognize some of my weaknesses. In response to my question "What lack I yet?" the Spirit told me I needed to overcome my fiery temper. <br /><br />I was overly competitive when playing basketball or racquetball or anything where someone was keeping score. I had embarrassed myself a few times by losing my temper over a ballgame. I asked the Lord to help me overcome this weakness, and He heard my prayers. <br /><br />Gradually, I was blessed with more patience in all areas of my life. I knew I was making progress when my mother said one day, "You have really changed ever since you joined the Mormon church. You won't even argue with me anymore." I considered that a great compliment. If you should find yourself challenged in the same way, if you find you could use more patience--why not ask? Patience is a spiritual gift. <br /><br />Do you get discouraged easily? Could you use a big infusion of optimism and hope? There is one thing you should know: Hope is also a gift of the Spirit. If you want to be filled with hope, why not ask? <br /><br />A young adult named Hannah was invited to the bishop's office one Sunday and was called to teach the Gospel Doctrine class in her YSA ward. She was terrified at the idea. Being naturally shy and introverted, and having never served a mission, she felt very inadequate when it came to explaining the scriptures. <br /><br />Hannah accepted the calling, but with many misgivings. The bishop assured her that the Lord would help her to succeed. He quoted President Monson, who has said many times, "Whom the Lord calls, the Lord qualifies." <br /><br />That night, Hannah opened the lesson manual and read the upcoming lesson. Then she knelt down and humbly prayed: "Please bless me with the gift of courage. Help me not to be afraid to teach." <br /><br />As she pondered the task ahead, this thought came into her heart: "You don't have to do all the talking. If you will ask a few inspired questions, the Spirit will help teach the class." <br /><br />She responded to that prompting, preparing several good discussion questions based on the lesson material. By the time Sunday came, Hannah felt at peace. She threw out one question after another, and members of the Gospel Doctrine class were quick to respond. The more that class members participated, the more they all learned. As the weeks and months went by, Hannah began to look forward to those Sunday lessons. She realized that courage to "teach in the Savior's way" is a gift that God is happy to give us--if we will just ask. <br /><br />Let me share another story of a Church member who tried hard to magnify his calling and was blessed with an amazing spiritual gift. Brother John Macfarlane was called to be a choir director in St. George, Utah, in the 1860s. One year, he decided the choir needed a new carol for their Christmas program. He had little experience at writing hymns, but he was not afraid to pray for help, for the gift to compose. <br /><br />"One night it came, suddenly, in a dream. John was awake instantly. He shook his wife, Ann, into wakefulness, crying out: "Ann, Ann, I have the words for a song, and I think I have the music too!" (Lloyd Wayland Macfarlane, <em>Yours Sincerely, John M. Macfarlane</em>).<em></em> <br /><br />The song that John was given in his dream has become a beloved Christmas hymn played and sung all over the world. We know it as "Far, Far Away on Judea's Plains." The music and the lyrics were inspired of God, given in the form of a spiritual gift to a dedicated choir director. <br /><br />One of the first pioneer Saints to receive a patriarchal blessing was Elizabeth Ann Whitney. The patriarch blessed her with the gift of "inspirational singing" (Hyrum Andrus, <em>They Knew the Prophet,</em> 45).<em> </em>Whether they realize it or not, thousands of Latter-day Saints are blessed with this same spiritual gift. Their singing inspires us to be better. It's no wonder that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is the most famous choir in all the world. The credit goes to the Holy Ghost. <br /><br />Can home teachers and visiting teachers ask for spiritual gifts? Of course! What are some gifts that would help Church members magnify these important callings to watch over and strengthen their brothers and sisters? How about discernment, to look into another's heart and see how you can be of service? How about charity, to love a person enough that you are not afraid to help? The scriptures teach that "perfect love casteth out all fear" (1 John 4:18). <br /><br />Years ago, when we were young parents, we had a home teacher who had a gift for relating to children. He knew how to talk to them, how to teach them simple gospel lessons, and how to let them know that he was their true friend. Our children looked forward to his visits, and so did I. <br /><br />Joseph Smith possessed this same gift, and it was a blessing to all the families of the early Church. He played games with the young boys, picked wildflowers for the little girls, and calmed the most rambunctious toddlers. He knew how to listen with love and to teach by example. As a result, no one was more loyal to the Prophet than the children in Nauvoo. Would you like to be blessed with the same gift, to influence the rising generation for good? Then why not ask? <br /><br />Whenever I read the Book of Mormon, I am struck by the important mission given to the prophet Moroni. He wandered all alone for many years, hiding from his enemies, safeguarding the record of his people. Since it was not easy to engrave on the sacred plates, Moroni recorded only the things of most importance in the final chapters of the Book of Mormon. <br /><br />Consider the very last chapter of the book, Moroni 10. More than half of the verses in this final chapter are teachings about spiritual gifts. Moroni believed that seeking the gifts of the Spirit was a very important message--and so do I! Listen to these parting words from the prophet: "Remember that every good gift cometh of Christ.... <br /><br />"Remember that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that all these gifts of which I have spoken, which are spiritual, never will be done away, even as long as the world shall stand, only according to the unbelief of the children of men" (Moroni 10:18-19). <br /><br />How can you and I follow the admonition of Moroni to "lay hold upon every good gift" (Moroni 10:30)? <br /><br />After we have asked the Lord "What lack I yet?" and after we have received an answer from the Spirit, then we will know for sure what we need to improve. Then we can come boldly before the throne of God and ask for the gift that would help us overcome our weakness. In this way, our weaknesses will truly become our strengths. <br /><br />For example, if the Holy Ghost whispers to you that you need to be a more conscientious student, you might then ask for the gift of organization or for the gift of knowledge or for the gift of recall. <br /><br />God is waiting to hear from you. So why not ask? He still expects you to do your part, but He also wants you to use your heavenly resources. <br /><br />I testify that miracles are still happening every day, that angels are still ministering, and that spiritual gifts are still available to those who seek them, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>In many cultures, the telling of stories is an art used to pass on essential values from generation to generation. Stories can help us understand important principles, others' needs, and ourselves. Stories reveal the threads that bind us together. With the explosion of social media, we now rely on the Internet for much of our knowledge. But the richness of personal stories creates a shared world for each of us. Over the years, family stories are told in journals, at family gatherings, and even at bedtime. And I'm sure hashtags or emojis didn't accompany these stories! Stories illustrate and teach family values and perpetuate our rich family legacies. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, is the master storyteller who used parables to teach gospel truths. It is important to listen to stories. And we need to tell and write our own stories. In the midst of all the noise of our modern world, stories continue to root us to our past and help us define our future. <br /><br />I'd planned to begin today's devotional with a pop quiz! Just kidding! But I do want to pose a question: If someone were to tell your story, what would it be? Would it be a mystery filled with twists and turns, or would it be a comedy? What is your story? What narrative are you creating for yourself? I know you can multitask, so please think about your own story as I tell you some BYU-Idaho stories. &nbsp; <br /><br />I've learned much from the BYU-Idaho stories you've shared. There are many reasons why each of us came to BYU-Idaho. Some of you chose to come to Rexburg to be with like-minded people who share your gospel values. Some of you chose to stay close to home and family, while others were led, as one student describes it, "to a unique place, isolated from just about all civilization, guided and protected by the Spirit of the Lord." Some of you found affordable tuition appealing. Many of you have described the blessings of being in a place that invites you to come closer to God while gaining knowledge. You've received testimonies of your divine worth. Some of you have been blessed to find your eternal companion. You've found lifelong friends. I love how President Henry J. Eyring described our BYU-Idaho family situation during the first devotional of this semester, in which he and his amazing wife, Kelly, spoke together. He said, "Each member of this educational family is enrolled in a modern-day School of the Prophets, sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and presided over by President Thomas S. Monson and the members of the Church Board of Education."<a href="/devotionals/carma-miller#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I cannot do justice to the importance of your stories by simply summarizing them, so I'd like to tell you three stories with more detail. Let's begin with the story of Douglas Phan. &nbsp; <br /><br />Like many of you, much thought and prayer preceded Douglas's decision to come to BYU-Idaho. He considered other paths, but the Spirit prevailed, and Douglas chose a most unexpected path that has proved to be guided by the Lord.</p>
<p><img alt="Douglas Phan" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring%202017/Graphics/Douglas-Phan_200x300.jpg" width="200" /><br /><br />While you may not have met Douglas, some of his work has been displayed in the Spori Building. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In many ways, Douglas blends in with thousands of other BYU-Idaho students, but his story diverges. Douglas was born in Hanoi, Vietnam, to parents who divorced when he was 16. The family separation prompted many questions, including his own purpose in life. Enter his high school physics teacher, who told the students about an unfamiliar book called the Bible. Douglas explains that this really was an odd topic because in Vietnam, "Christianity is not popular. In fact, it's almost taboo, and most people consider themselves atheists."<a href="/devotionals/carma-miller#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> Douglas felt prompted to learn more about Christian churches and determine whether they were as "sketchy" as portrayed in the media. &nbsp; He located a Christian church called "Latter-Day Saints" just five minutes from his home. Later he learned it was one of only two LDS branches in the entire country. Although Douglas had planned to sit in the back of the church, observe, and then leave, his decision to seek increased knowledge and understanding led Douglas to a different experience. When he arrived, he was warmly welcomed, and a young man led him to a seat in the front of the chapel. This was not at all what he'd planned, but inside he felt an unusual feeling of peace. He liked the feeling, so he stayed. The young man spoke Vietnamese so perfectly that initially Douglas didn't realize he was American. Interested, Douglas asked him about his background and was invited to learn more. To his surprise, the first lesson was about whether there was purpose in life. &nbsp; <br /><br />Within three months, Douglas made a decision that changed the course of his life forever. He entered into the covenant of baptism and promised to take upon himself the name of Jesus Christ. Almost immediately, his life took on greater purpose: He developed a great drive to develop spiritually and to learn English. He volunteered to translate for visitors to Hanoi, and his vocabulary and pronunciation improved rapidly. Upon learning of the Church's education system, his post-high school plans to attend a university in Finland changed. His desire to progress in the gospel and lead a purposeful life brought him to Rexburg, Idaho. Douglas views coming to BYU-Idaho as the best decision he's made in his life. It was a difficult decision, though, because he worried about leaving his mother, with whom he had a close relationship, alone in Vietnam. &nbsp; <br /><br />But, once he arrived and met his faculty, he knew he'd made a good choice. He says: "I truly love it here. I have a personal and meaningful relationship with my faculty, which I'd not expected in college."<a href="/devotionals/carma-miller#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a></p>

<p>Although Douglas had planned for years to major in business, instead he chose a major in communication with a public-relations emphasis. Because he followed spiritual promptings, he discovered an immense talent of which he was completely unaware. He says, "I picked up a camera for the first time a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Douglas has about a year left until he completes his degree. But first, a much-prayed-for detour. He explains: "Last summer, right after my internship at Universal Studios in Florida, I invited my mom to come here.</p>

<p>It was supposed to be my ticket to go back to Vietnam, but a part of me realized she needed to come see what I was doing and see these Mormon people. That experience, I think, touched her heart, and she realized I should go on a mission. It's mind-blowing to me that she would ever agree for me to go on a mission before I graduated college, because the culture in Vietnam is that education is number one. The Lord remembered my promise to serve Him."<a href="/devotionals/carma-miller#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />The next chapter of Elder Douglas Phan's BYU-Idaho story now moves to a new location. He reported to the Provo MTC just five weeks ago and will serve for the next two years in the Texas Houston South Mission. Elder Phan's story is unfinished, but his choices, dedicated work, and willingness to follow the Lord's path for him have created a story that is as beautiful and majestic as his photos.</p>

<p>Next, I'd like to share Tiffany Anderson's story with you. &nbsp; <br /><br />Tiffany married at age 17 after learning she was expecting a baby. She attended night and summer classes to finish her senior year of high school before the baby arrived. Later, with family encouragement, Tiffany and her husband were sealed in the temple. But just six days afterward, Tiffany's father suddenly passed away. The loss was difficult, and within a short time both Tiffany and her husband became inactive. The ensuing years brought lifestyle changes, and looking back she recognizes her step-by-step downward spiral as she felt increasingly resentful and blamed others for judging her. Tiffany told herself, "They don't accept or love me, so why bother to go to church?" She now reflects, "Sure, maybe some at church were judgmental, but it was really me judging myself. The mind starts to warp things."<a href="/devotionals/carma-miller#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />The years flew by, her inactivity lengthened, and her family grew. As her three young children entered school, Tiffany began to experience an internal tugging to find her true identity. Her tobacco and alcohol use had become extreme, and she felt she was losing herself. She didn't want her children's memories of her to be associated with the smell of cigarette smoke or alcohol. On New Year's Day 2012, she made a resolution to quit using alcohol and tobacco. She has maintained that resolution ever since. &nbsp; <br /><br />Soon after, although still completely inactive, she was unexpectedly invited to pray in her ward's sacrament meeting, something she had never done before. Regardless of her lifestyle choices, she didn't want to say no to the Lord. During that same sacrament meeting, Tiffany heard an announcement for a new Pathway Program fireside, and when she returned home, she announced she would be enrolling in Pathway. To her delight, her husband was supportive. &nbsp; <br /><br />She had almost completed her Pathway application when she stopped short as she read the Honor Code statement. It had been just nine months since she'd made her New Year's promise, and she was still unsure of herself and her abilities. She deleted her application but then decided to alert the Pathway missionaries of her decision. Their immediate response to her call was "No, no, no, all we're asking is that you'll <em>try</em> to live the Honor Code. You'll <em>try</em> to begin attending church every week. That's all we're asking." Tiffany replied, "Okay, I can try. But I can't promise anything right now." Again, she was reassured, so this time she clicked "submit," and enrolled in Pathway. &nbsp; <br /><br />Attending Pathway turned out to be difficult. Initially, she advised her husband, "There's no way those Mormons are going to suck me in. I just want a cheap education; that's it." However, she was required to attend a Book of Mormon religion class. She joked about her courses and ate a lot of Hot Tamale candies to control her anxiety as she began moving from an inactive lifestyle to discussions of the gospel during every Pathway class. One evening, during a lesson and discussion about addictions, several classmates confessed to perceived addictions of excessive chocolate, Facebook, and eating. Tiffany's anxiety mounted, and she began to feel overwhelmed by all the "prettiness," as she calls it. Finally, she stood up and said, "My name is Tiffany, and I'm addicted to alcohol and cigarettes. I've been sober for 9 months. We're talking about real-life addictions here, the ones that pull us away from the Church." She was shaking as she sat down. The class was silent until someone said, "My spouse is addicted to painkillers."<a href="/devotionals/carma-miller#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a> Discussions became open and vulnerable, and a close bond developed as the class shared problems and struggles. Tiffany had shared her story and fostered a new sense of community with her peers. &nbsp; <br /><br />As Tiffany's anxiety began to ease, she decided to start over and investigate the Church thoroughly. She asked many questions regarding basic gospel doctrine. Often, the Pathway missionaries and institute teachers stayed after class to further explain gospel concepts. Tiffany came to love the Pathway Program, and her testimony grew. The day came when she shared her testimony in sacrament meeting and was content with its simplicity. She was confident of what she felt, and knew the truth of what she said. &nbsp; <br /><br />As Tiffany neared completion of her Pathway courses, she was invited to speak at a BYU-Idaho conference. She worried about her ability to speak to such a large audience, but said yes. Tiffany was the final student speaker, and although she remembers other students' descriptions of long-term Church activity and the hope of a college education, her story was unique. She told the audience: "I am not like my fellow students. I am not 'the 99.' I was the lost one, and Pathway is the shepherd that came back to rescue me. This is not just an educational program. It is so much more. This program wants, needs, and welcomes those who have been lost from the Church, no matter who they are or where they came from. Pathway will not just affect me; my children will know education is important, and my family will be affected for generations."<a href="/devotionals/carma-miller#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[viii]</a></p>

<p>Tiffany was the first Pathway graduate to complete an online bachelor's degree with no previous college education. She is again active in the Church, attends the temple regularly, and finds joy in her service. We don't know the end of Tiffany's story, but she has a bright future ahead of her. Right now, she is spending quality time with three teenagers and waiting for the next "Pathway" the Lord will open to her.</p>

<p>We are so fortunate to have Tiffany Anderson with us today. And, Tiffany, I'd like to invite you to come to the podium. &nbsp; <br /><br />CARMA MILLER: Tiffany, clearly one of your life themes is the importance of seeking those who are lost. Will you tell us how you plan to share the blessings of your own personal BYU-Idaho story? &nbsp; <br /><br />TIFFANY ANDERSON: At one point or another, in each of our lives we are "the lost one." And I testify there is always a shepherd out there looking for you. They may be your family, friends, home and visiting teachers, or the stranger you just happen to meet. We have discussed brief highlights of my story, but my path was and continues to be hindered by life's challenges. They come in the form of a learning disability, depression, anxiety, addictions, perfectionism, financial difficulties, self-doubt, and the problems that come from balancing school with family and work. I hope to be able to own my vulnerabilities and share them with those in need. Because of the Pathway Program and my shepherds, I have a responsibility to find others and let them know they are needed, wanted, and welcome, no matter who they are or where they come from or what challenges they may be facing. To be honest, I'm not sure how or when these opportunities will arise, but when the Lord sees fit to put these tender moments in front of me, I will not hesitate to seize the opportunity. &nbsp; <br /><br />CARMA MILLER: I'd like to share one more story from long ago, but with implications for each of us. Had this story not occurred, it's likely our own stories would be different. &nbsp; <br /><br />In 1847, the same year the pioneers entered the Salt Lake Valley, Jacob Spori was born in a small village in the Swiss Alps. Jacob entered college at the age of 16, and three years later, he graduated with honors in German, French, math, history, music, penmanship, drafting, geography, religion, psychology, and the natural sciences. &nbsp; <br /><br />Jacob was soon widely recognized for his excellence as a thinker and teacher. He was honored in national publications, invited to serve on a prestigious church council, and elected by a landslide vote to the town council.</p>
<p><img alt="Young Jacob Spori with his wife" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring%202017/Graphics/Young-Jacob-Spori-with-his-wife_200x300.jpg" width="200" /></p>
<p>By age 30, Jacob and his wife, Magdalena, were the parents of two children, owned a large home, and were important members of their community. From all appearances, Jacob was successful, yet he felt unsettled. His fine mind began to question his life's purpose and its relationship to his religious culture. This was particularly dangerous because his family, employment, and social standing were completely intertwined with the Swiss Reformed Church.</p>
<p>And then Jacob heard something that astounded him. God's great kingdom of the future had been restored to the earth and was being established in America's Far West. Jacob was not na&iuml;ve and understood the consequences of such an event. He wrote: "Many terrible things were being said about this people, the Mormons. I fully expected this, knowing that all the powers and lies of darkness would be rushed to the battle once God initiated the restoration of all things." Nevertheless, Jacob was baptized. His testimony was bright, and his devotion never faltered, although his wife had no interest in his newfound religion. As soon as he joined the Church, Jacob lost his community status. His teaching was questioned, he underwent an intense investigation, and his teaching contract was canceled. During the next election, he received less than 10 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Jacob desired to go to the Zion he had sought for many years. Going meant leaving his wife and children behind. Magdalena stood to lose the family fortune if she went with Jacob, so she and the children moved into her parents' home, and Jacob left for Zion. By staying, Magdalena faced the ridicule of relatives and friends after Jacob left. She steadily refused their pleadings to divorce him, and although she could not see the truth of the gospel, she recognized that his faith had made him a finer man.&nbsp;<br /><br />Zion contrasted sharply with Jacob's sheltered academic life in Switzerland. As an immigrant who did not speak English, it was impossible to find work in academics, languages, or writing. Fortunately he was strong and energetic, so he shoveled snow, laid railroad track, and did farm and sawmill work. This created a new humility, and later, as a missionary, Jacob introduced himself simply as a woodchopper, never mentioning his education or teaching experience. Jacob was often lonely and depressed, missing his wife and children terribly, but he considered himself rich and blessed for having found the gospel. &nbsp; <br /><br />After five years in Utah, Jacob accepted a call to serve in the Swiss-German mission. His first month was spent becoming reacquainted with his wife and children. Because of Jacob's extraordinary ability with languages, he was reassigned to serve as the first LDS missionary in the Middle East. Through a series of events involving a severe injury when their oldest daughter fell from a swing, Sister Spori witnessed the power of the gospel, and she was baptized and confirmed just a week before Jacob left for Constantinople (now Istanbul), Turkey. The trip was difficult, and he tormented himself with guilt that he'd been too long away from his family and had now left them again. Letters from home were difficult as Magdalena wrote of her own doubts and of her worry for their injured child.</p>
<p><img alt="Jacob Spori with mission companions" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring%202017/Graphics/Jacob-Spori-with-mission-companions_200x300.jpg" width="200" /></p>
<p>In Turkey, Jacob forced himself to focus on his missionary work, and peace came as he taught the gospel in five new languages he'd learned: Turkish, Armenian, Syrian, Hebrew, and Arabic. Six months later, news arrived that their 10-year-old daughter, Katharina, had died from her injuries. Jacob managed to accept her death and continue working. He was sent to Israel, where he performed the first baptism in Palestine and assisted in the formation of the first LDS branch there. Jacob served faithfully, and, after 2 &frac12; years of service, earned enough money to return home. &nbsp; <br /><br />Within two months of Jacob's return, the family left Switzerland forever. They came directly to Rexburg, Idaho, a small settlement established only five years earlier. Magdalena, 8 &frac12; months pregnant, said the hardest trip of her life was the final 25 miles to Rexburg, jolting across lava beds in a hay wagon with no springs. The Sporis lived temporarily in the tithing granary where Magdalena delivered their fifth baby.</p>
<p><img alt="Group of Bannock Academy students and staff" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring%202017/Graphics/Group-of-Bannock-Academy-students-and-staff_350x200.jpg" width="350" /></p>
<p>Jacob was chosen as principal of the new Bannock Stake Academy, founded in late 1888. He had no doubt he'd been called to Rexburg to build the kingdom. Jacob Spori clearly understood your future when he articulated this prophetic statement 128 years ago: "The seeds we are planting today will grow and become mighty oaks, and their branches will run all over the earth."<a href="/devotionals/carma-miller#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[ix]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />As you may have expected, the fledgling Bannock Stake Academy struggled, and Jacob honored his sacred duty to keep it running. Through the great personal sacrifice of Jacob and subsequent leaders, the Bannock Stake Academy became Ricks College and, ultimately, BYU-Idaho. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now, I'd like you to think about your own BYU-Idaho story. As you tell your story to your own children and grandchildren, how will you cast yourself? Will you be a seed, a branch, or a mighty oak? I'd like to give you the opportunity now to take 60 seconds and share even just a small part of your BYU-Idaho story with a neighbor. Please take 60 seconds to share. <br /><br />----- <br /><br />I hope you had an opportunity to share a meaningful story. </p>
<p>Shortly before his assignment to lead BYU-Pathway Worldwide, I asked President Gilbert about his BYU-Idaho story. It's an amazing story that I would characterize as a page-turner filled with remarkable twists and turns. I have thought often since then of the incredible wealth of stories in the lives of our BYU-Idaho teachers, leaders, and students. In closing, I'd like to share with you President Gilbert's response to a question I asked him: "Why here? Why BYU-Idaho?" Perhaps it will help us find greater clarity as we compose our own stories. President&nbsp;Gilbert responded:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If we really understand BYU-Idaho, we understand that its location matters. Not only is it rural; it is isolated. You would come here only if you believed you were coming to build the kingdom. There is something about this place that requires those who come to know they are supposed to be here. They didn't come for the weather or the scenic views of the sagebrush. Whether faculty, staff, administration, or students, I believe every person is here for a purpose. Many students here sacrificed because they didn't get their preferred track, didn't get to start fall semester like their high school friends, or because it is so cold. Yet the Lord brought them here. And He will consecrate their affliction for their good.<a href="/devotionals/carma-miller#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[x]</a></p>
<p>If you have not shared your BYU-Idaho story, I encourage you to share your story before today ends. Even if your story is a very rough draft, you will plant a seed that will root you to your past and will begin to define your future. I bear testimony that your life, and your purpose in being here at BYU-Idaho, is not just a series of coincidences. You are here for a purpose. Knowing and telling your own story will bless your life and the lives of others. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Pre-devotional Discussion</strong>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, it is a pleasure to be here with you today. I love BYU-Idaho with all my heart. I love it because of you, the students, and you, my colleagues. <br /><br /> I want to pay tribute to my wife, my parents, and other family members who have traveled to be here today. They are awesome, and I love them. <br /><br />I was glad to see you raise your scriptures to show that you are prepared to learn. I hope you also have a notebook, because I'm going to invite you to write some things down. In fact, let's do it right now. <br /><br />Take 30 seconds to think of a time when you felt the Holy Ghost, and write it down in one sentence. You might start with "I felt the Holy Ghost when . . ." If you think you haven't had an experience with the Holy Ghost, just write "no experience." <br /><br />President Spencer W. Kimball said that perhaps the most important word in the dictionary is <em>remember</em> and that our greatest need is to remember (Spencer W. Kimball, "Circles of Exaltation," address to religious educators, Brigham Young University, June 28, 1968, 8). <br /><br />The title of my talk today is "Look Up and Remember." <br /><br />You are here at college to look to the future and to learn. It is a fantastic time of life. It is a time that is full of hope. It is a time of great faith and decisions. It is a season of personal growth and enlightenment. I have immense respect for you because I know that you are sincerely searching for truth and knowledge. You are striving to learn and improve your lives so you can serve other people better. I admire you for that. But this is also a time of life when it can be easy to get distracted and unintentionally begin to drift. Let me illustrate this with a story. <br /><br />I grew up in California about 30 miles from the beach. <br /><br />One of my first memories of the beach is when I was four or five years old. After spreading out our towels, setting up the picnic, and establishing base camp, I promised my parents to be careful as I ran down to the water to play. I played the "don't get caught by the wave" game. This is where you get as close to the water as possible; then, when a wave comes in, you run away to avoid getting wet. Then, as the water retreats back into the ocean, you follow it as closely as possible without getting wet. Then the next wave comes in, and you do the same thing. Up and down, down and up. Over and over again. Some other kids joined in the fun, and at one point one of them threw a ball into the water. We focused on it as it went up and back with the waves. I was enjoying myself and having lots of fun. I played for a long time before getting tired and noticing that my friends had all disappeared, so I decided to take a break. <br /><br />I ran up to where my family was, but the towels, the picnic, and my family were gone. I ran through all the many people, looking for my family, but they were nowhere to be seen. I was confused. <br /><br />Then I started to cry. I cried as I walked and ran aimlessly through the crowd in random directions. <br /><br />A kind lady, a stranger, lifted me into her arms and began to comfort me. I, being an astute child, recognized that she was a stranger, and so I cried louder. But she was kind and gentle. She said not to worry and that we would find my parents, and then she started to walk up the beach in the wrong direction. <br /><br />It was a fact that I was lost, but I knew she was even more lost. I kicked her and tried to get away, but she held me tight and continued to walk and talk softly for several minutes. Then, suddenly, I saw my dad walking quickly towards us. <br /><br />The handoff was made, and my rescuer disappeared. I started to think, "Wow, she was really nice," and I wondered how she knew which way to walk. I was glad I hadn't succeeded in kicking her away. My dad took me back to our towels and family, and I was saved. <br /><br />At the time, I felt it very important that I not be responsible for getting lost. I blamed my parents for not watching me close enough; I blamed my new friends for leaving me; I blamed the ball that kept me hyper occupied; I blamed the crowds on the beach; in the end, I blamed the whole beach. I didn't know the word at the time, but I made myself into a victim. <br /><br />My dad taught me, however, that it was my responsibility to look up often to make sure I knew where our towels and family were. He promised that if I did that, I would not get lost again. <br /><br />I played all the rest of the day, but I made sure to look up often and, as a result, never got lost again. <br /><br />While studying geology in college, I learned that what I had experienced is called longshore drift. This is where waves hit the beach at an angle and wash up as far as they can go; then the water returns to the sea by the shortest possible route, which is straight downhill, not back along the same angle it came up in. The net effect of this continuous motion is to move the sand in a series of arcs along the beach face. <br /><br />For example, it's estimated that one million cubic yards of sand per year are moved southward across the beach at Santa Monica, California (Charles C. Plummer, <em>Physical Geology,</em> Eighth edition, 343). <br /><br />I was like a piece of sand. By following the waves up at an angle, then straight down, over and over again, I had made my way down the beach quite a distance without even knowing it. I thought I was just going up and down in the same spot, but I wasn't. I was unintentionally drifting, and in that process I got lost. My family hadn't moved; I had. My family wasn't lost; I was. I hadn't intended to get lost, but I did. <br /><br />My dear friends, we must look up often and remember basic doctrines of the gospel so we don't drift and get lost like I did on that beach that day so long ago. <br /><br />My purpose today is to review six basic doctrines and to suggest one approach for remembering each. This comes with a challenge to choose at least one of these doctrines and deliberately seek to remember it more often. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>1. The first doctrine we need to remember is that God lives, loves us, and answers our prayers.</strong> <br /><br />He is our Father. He is not a distant, uninterested God. Just the opposite, He knows us as individuals and cares about our struggles and our successes. We are His children, and He is a good father. We will be overwhelmed with gratitude, gladness, peace, and comfort when we see Him again. <br /><br />Sometime in our premortal existence, our Heavenly Father let us know that we would be coming to the earth. He informed us that we would have good times and hard times. He made it clear to us that, through those good and hard times, we would learn valuable lessons that would serve us well for the eternities to come. So, now, here we are on the earth, learning and stretching and growing. Sometimes it is super, super joyful, and other times it is super, super hard, but it is always a learning experience. No matter how joyful or how hard it may be, we have learned that there is a beautiful rhythm to life when we understand and live with gospel purpose, always remembering that we are on earth by design and for a purpose. <br /><br />Most, if not all, of us have prayed about whether to go to college and which college to go to. Answers to those prayers have brought us to where we are today. Whether you are a traditional student, an online student, or a Pathway student, you are in the right place. You belong here. You are capable and deserving of being a student here. You are here by design and for a purpose. <br /><br />Our Heavenly Father loves each of us, and as we strive to draw near to Him, He will draw even closer to us and will help us with choices we need to make (see D&amp;C 88:63). <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>One way we can remember that we are children of God is to pray to Him every day. </strong> <br /><br />For the past 21 years, every semester, I've been blessed to teach a class for international students with English as a second language. I've had students from every continent and from over 50 countries. In my other classes I've had students from around the United States and other English-speaking countries. I've been blessed to experience the music of many languages and cultures and to see perspectives from around the world, and it's been wonderful. <br /><br />I have heard all of these people pray in their own languages, and I know that Heavenly Father heard every single prayer. Regardless of country, culture, or language, He listens to us because we are all His children and He is interested in where we are, what we are doing, and where we are going. As the Book of Mormon says, "God is mindful of every people" (Alma 26:37). <br /><br />President Gordon B. Hinckley said: "We have become as a great family spread across this vast world. We speak different tongues. We live under a variety of circumstances. But in the heart of each of us beats a common testimony" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "Listen by the Power of the Spirit," <em>Ensign,</em> Nov. 1996, 5). <br /><br />Part of this testimony is that God lives and He loves us. We are His children. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>2. The second doctrine we need to remember is that the Holy Ghost can teach us the truth of all things.</strong> <br /><br />Sometimes we forget that we have felt the Spirit in our lives. We may forget when the Holy Ghost has spoken to us about the truth and fulness of the gospel. I appreciate the many posts on the discussion board about how you remembered your experiences with the Spirit. When we feel dull and dreary, we need to be able to pull up our memories of our experiences with the Holy Ghost and remember that the gospel was true then, and it's still true now. <br /><br />Being able to remember our experiences with the Holy Ghost will help us in good times and in hard times. <br /><br />I wonder how many times Joseph Smith reflected on that moment in the grove when he prayed and received his first vision. I also wonder how often he reflected on that moment when he read James 1:5-6 and felt the Spirit encourage him to ask for wisdom. I bet he thought about those things every day and it gave him the courage to do what he needed to do. We should strive to remember our experiences every day too. They will help keep us grounded and give us the courage to do what we need to do. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>One way we can remember the Holy Ghost is to reflect on our spiritual experiences and write them down.</strong> <br /><br />I recall being 14 years old and on vacation at my grandma and grandpa's house. In a small bedroom on the second floor of their farmhouse, I remember reading the Book of Mormon where it says that to be prosperous I had to keep the commandments. I felt the Holy Ghost whisper to me that it was true. This story is not a dramatic story, but it's one I reflect on often because it was clear to me, and it helped shape my future. <br /><br />Now it's your turn. Take a minute and turn to a person near you, and share what you wrote in your notebook earlier about the experience you had with the Holy Ghost. Also discuss why you think it's important to remember our experiences with the Holy Ghost. Some experiences are personal and only intended for you, but if your experience is not too personal, please feel free to share some details about it. <br /><br />Thank you. <br /><br />Some of us might be thinking that we've never felt the Holy Ghost in our lives. I get that, but please pay close attention to what we are taught in the Doctrine and Covenants: <br /><br />"To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world. <br /><br />"To others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful" (D&amp;C 46:13-14). <br /><br />If we can't remember a time when we felt the Holy Ghost, that's okay. We can cultivate the gift of believing in the testimonies of others who love and care about us, then have patience with ourselves as we continue to strive to recognize and understand the voice and language of the Holy Ghost. If we persist, we will prevail, but it will be on the Lord's timetable, not ours. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>3. The third doctrine we need to remember is that we are here to learn and develop faith.</strong> <br /><br />I'm going to ask some of you to stand up, so listen carefully. If you have learned a language other than your first language and have lived where that language was spoken, will you please, reverently, stand up and stay standing. <br /><br />Great. <br /><br />Okay, remember the first three months of your experience speaking your new language in a new country. Did any of you standing ever pretend to understand something when you had no clue what was going on? For example, do you remember laughing at jokes or other things just because everybody else was laughing, but you had no idea what was so funny? Did you ever shake your head like you understood what people were talking about, but you were in the dark about what they were really saying? If you ever did any of these things, please raise your hand. <br /><br />It looks like a lot of hands are raised. Thank you. Please be seated. <br /><br />Our Heavenly Father often expresses His love for us by giving us opportunities to exercise our faith. The state of not knowing is a wonderful opportunity to learn, stretch, and grow. For example, just because we didn't understand the language at the beginning of our experience didn't mean that the language was incomprehensible to everyone. Even little children spoke it fluently. It just meant we had a lot to learn and practice.&nbsp; <br /><br />On one hand, the state of not knowing is frustrating, awkward, uncomfortable, and depressing. On the other hand, it gives us space to learn and grow. &nbsp; <br /><br />Remember that Nephi and Alma in the Book of Mormon had things they did not know. Nephi once said, "I do not know the meaning of all things," (1 Nephi 11:16-17) and Alma once said, "These mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me" (Alma 37:11). (See W. Mark Bassett, "For Our Spiritual Development and Learning," <em>Ensign, </em>Nov. 2016.) <br /><br />I like how they were very straightforward in what they didn't know. They didn't make up excuses or explanations. I believe that they departed this life with many questions. I also believe that they know things today that they never knew during their earthly existence. The important thing is that they recognized that they didn't know everything, and it was okay. They knew that they knew enough to commit, receive ordinances, make covenants, and live the gospel. Then they had faith to keep going. <br /><br />They continued striving to learn and understand things, but they also continued to look up to heaven when there were things they didn't understand yet. <br /><br />Now, back to school. Research suggests that one of the most important things we can do to learn and succeed in college is to attend every class. Similarly, I suggest that: <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>One way we can remember that we are here to learn and develop faith is to attend church every week.</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>4. The fourth doctrine we need to remember is that Jesus Christ is our Savior.</strong> <br /><br />He accomplished the Atonement so that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father. This included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, His death on the cross at Calvary, and His Resurrection from the garden tomb. <br /><br />After a long day of school, work, social encounters, extracurricular activities, family duties, and church responsibilities, we can sometimes feel like this poor little guy.</p>
<p><img alt="Mouse laying on a rock covered in water" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Spring%202017/Graphics/Mouse-in-Water_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />Sometimes we might wonder if it's all worth it. Sometimes we might feel like quitting and wonder, again, why we are even here. We might feel physically tired and also tired deep down in our souls. <br /><br />When we feel like this, please remember that Jesus is our Savior both now and in eternity. <br /><br />Remember that our Savior was talking to us when He said: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. <br /><br />"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls" (Matthew 11:28-29). <br /><br />I appreciated Floriana's scripture reading of Helaman 5:12 and the reminder to build our foundation on Christ. <br /><br />Many years ago, Sister Hazard and I stayed in a high-rise hotel in the middle of downtown San Francisco. We were in our room on about the 17th floor when an earthquake hit. It was scary and fascinating to look out across the city and watch enormous high-rise buildings swaying back and forth. It was even more fascinating to feel the swaying of our own building. We saw and felt firsthand how critical the foundation of a building was to its structural integrity and success. We were scared, but we were safe. <br /><br />The Savior taught, "Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them ... is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock; and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock" (Luke 6:47-48). <br /><br />It's very clear that floods will come even if our foundation is built on Christ. Everybody has struggles. The storms will come. That's one of the purposes of living. We are here to learn, and hard things help us learn. They can be great blessings if we see them from the right perspective. When our foundations are built on the gospel of Jesus Christ, we might still be scared, but we will be safe. <br /><br />When Sister Cheryl Esplin spoke here in May, she said, "As we consecrate a portion of our study each week to learn all we can of our Savior, Jesus Christ, ... [w]e will have the assurance that when He comes again, we will be ready to meet Him, and&nbsp;<em>we shall know Him</em>"&nbsp;(Cheryl A. Esplin, "Coming to Know Jesus Christ," Brigham Young University-Idaho devotional, May 9, 2017). <br /><br />In his talk titled "The Power of the Book of Mormon," from last general conference, President Monson asked us to prayerfully read the Book of Mormon every day so that we can strengthen our testimony of our Savior, who will see us through to safety (see Thomas S. Monson, "The Power of the Book of Mormon," <em>Ensign,</em> May 2017). <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>One way we can remember that Jesus is our Savior is to read the Book of Mormon every day.</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>5. The fifth doctrine we need to remember is that charity never faileth.</strong> <br /><br />Sometimes we will accidentally cause pain in others, but we should never purposefully try to hurt anyone. It's easy to be mean, but it is our opportunity to lift and build one another. <br /><br />As self-reliant as we strive to be, the truth is that we need each other. <br /><br />I like what President Monson said: "Life is perfect for none of us. Rather than being judgmental and critical of each other, may we have the pure love of Christ for our fellow travelers in this journey through life. May we recognize that each one is doing [his or] her best to deal with the challenges which come [their] way, and may we strive to do <em>our</em> best to help out" (Thomas S. Monson, "Charity Never Faileth," <em>Ensign,</em> Nov. 2010). <br /><br />One of the principles of the BYU-Idaho Learning Model is to love, serve, and teach one another. When I think about love in the context of the Learning Model, I think about charity and kindness. <br /><br />Elder Marvin J. Ashton said, "Perhaps the greatest charity comes when we are kind to each other, when we don't judge or categorize someone else, when we simply give each other the benefit of the doubt or remain quiet" (Marvin J. Ashton, "The Tongue Can Be a Sharp Sword," <em>Ensign,</em> May 1992). <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>One way we can remember charity is to</strong> do what President and Sister Eyring invited us to do in the first devotional of the semester and <strong>say hello to everyone </strong>(see Henry J. &amp; Kelly C. Eyring, "Hello, My Friend," Brigham Young University-Idaho devotional, Apr. 18, 2017). <br /><br />Saying hello is often the beginning of charity and kindness. As educated people, and as members of the Church, we should always be nice. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>6. The sixth doctrine we need to remember is that Heavenly Father's authority matters.</strong> <br /><br />You might remember this story that Elder Gary E. Stevenson told in April 2009 general conference. He said: "I remember a warm, sunny afternoon when spring was trying to nudge its way through a long winter in Cache Valley, Utah. My father, whose Saturdays were always filled with chores for his grandsons, stopped by our home with an offer to 'go for a ride.' Always happy to ride in Grandpa's truck, our four- and six-year-old sons scurried into the back jump seat, and I joined my father in the front. Our drive took us through the streets of downtown Logan, which wrap around the Logan Temple, prominently situated on a hill, centered beautifully in the city. As we moved further away from the city, we turned from paved, busy streets to seldom-used dirt roads, where we crossed old bridges and weaved through trees far into the country. We were far from any other traffic and all alone. &nbsp; <br /><br />"Realizing his grandsons were in a place they had not been before, my father stopped the truck. " Do you think we are lost?" he asked the wide-eyed boys as they gazed out the windshield across the valley. Followed by a moment of silent assessment came the profound reply of a young child. "Look," he said, pointing his finger. "Grandpa, you are never lost when you can see the temple." Our eyes turned, focusing with his, seeing the sun glistening off the spires of the Logan Temple, far across the valley. &nbsp; <br /><br />"You are never lost when you can see the temple. The temple will provide direction for you and your family in a world filled with chaos" (Gary E. Stevenson, "Sacred Homes, Sacred Temples," <em>Ensign,</em> May 2009). &nbsp; <br /><br />I want to point out that without the authority of God, the ordinances we receive and the covenants we make in the Church and in the temple would mean nothing. They might give us some direction and help us to be better people, but they would have no binding or saving power. They would be vain and empty. &nbsp; <br /><br />However, I testify that because God's authority is on the earth, authorized ordinances and covenants are valid and meaningful. Authority does matter.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I appreciated the opening hymn "Joseph Smith's First Prayer" (<em>Hymns, </em>no. 26). As you know, 173 years ago today, he and his brother Hyrum were killed at Carthage, Illinois, around 5:00 in the evening. John Taylor, who was there, wrote, "Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world" (D&amp;C 135:3). <br /><br />One of those things was to serve as a vessel through whom the priesthood, the authority of God, was returned to the earth. Through that authority, among other things, temples and temple ordinances were restored. Prophets ever since have encouraged us to be a temple worshiping people. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>One way we can remember that authority matters is to attend the temple regularly.</strong> <br /><br />I love our prophets and know that they have and do hold the keys of the priesthood. I know that each of them was called to serve during different times in history to deal with the issues of those specific times, and I know that President Monson has been called to give us direction during our time. We will always have a prophet on the earth whom God can use to guide us until our Savior comes again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do you remember the stranger lady who picked me up on the beach when I was lost? I compare her to the prophets. She knew where she was going, even when I thought she was walking in completely the wrong direction. Her voice was gentle and sure, even when I was furious and adamant and tried to kick her away. She knew the right way, and she got me back to my father and family. <br /><br />In summary, please remember today's challenge to choose at least one of the doctrines we've reviewed and deliberately seek to remember it more often. Which one will you choose? As a quick review, it is our opportunity and responsibility to: <br /><br />1. Look up and remember that God lives and He loves us <br />2. Look up and remember that the Holy Ghost can teach us the truth of all things <br />3. Look up and remember that we are here to learn and develop faith <br />4. Look up and remember that Jesus is our Savior <br />5. Look up and remember that charity never faileth <br />6. Look up and remember that Heavenly Father's authority and ordinances matter <br /><br />We can remember these things by:</p>
<p>1. Praying to Heavenly Father every day <br />2. Reflecting on our spiritual experiences every day <br />3. Attending church every week <br />4. Reading the Book of Mormon every day <br />5. Saying hello and being nice every day <br />6. Participating in temple worship regularly</p>
<p>I hope we remember the lesson of my little beach story so we won't get caught with our heads down and drift to places we don't recognize. We need to enjoy the journey and have fun, but while we are enjoying the journey, I hope we always remember to look up and remember who we are and find ourselves in the right place. And if we ever find that we have drifted, I hope we will not kick the prophet away but that we will allow him to help us return to our heavenly home.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;">Pre-devotional Discussion:</p>
<p><strong>Scriptures: </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Today is the last devotional of the semester. It is a particularly busy time for you, and you could be doing many other things right now, but you're not. Why did you choose to be here? What are you hoping to gain by coming to devotional today? I have been pondering this question for some time now as I have prepared for today. An idea that kept coming back to me was this: It is not a coincidence that we are here together at this time, on this day. <br /><br />Our Father in Heaven does not control our lives, and He certainly does not manipulate our decisions. But He is omniscient-He knows everything: the past, present, and future. Another way of thinking about it is that nothing can surprise God. It is not a surprise to Him that you are here today. He knows that something you feel or experience today, at this devotional, can help you. So that puts a lot of pressure on me&mdash;at least that's the way I've been feeling lately. So what do you need right now? What would help you the most on this particular day, at this specific moment in time? I have worried about this and prayed about it and worried about it some more and prayed about it some more. And then I realized that I don't need to worry. My job is not to solve your problems or answer your questions or even to inspire you. My job is simply to remind you of one vitally important truth. I am here today to deliver a simple yet profound message to you: God is your Father in Heaven. He loves you. He knows you. He is aware of you. He hears you. He will answer you. Nothing is more important to Him than you. Isn't that wonderful? &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are in the last full week of the semester. By my counting, this is the 66th day of class. We have been in session for 12 weeks. So you have had three full months of experiences this semester. For some of you, these have been three of the greatest months of your life. A week from today, some of you will be graduating, having overcome challenges. And now, having persevered, you will achieve a major milestone. Some of you have set and achieved other personal goals related to your coursework, social life, physical and mental health, and your testimony of the Savior and His restored gospel. Some of you have found your passion in life and set a course for a lifelong career. Some of you have created friendships that will last a lifetime, and others of you have found love and companionship, and through prayer have gained confirmation that you are now ready to make eternal covenants and build a life and family together. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For others of you, these last 12 weeks have not been so wonderful. Maybe your roommates or classes haven't been what you had hoped they would be. You may have struggled with a lack of confidence, fear, and loneliness in new surroundings. For some of you, this has been the most trying period of your life. Some of you have experienced the divorce of your parents. Some of you have struggled with debilitating physical or mental illness. There have been financial challenges and deep disappointments related to friends and dating relationships. Jobs have been lost. Assignments have been failed. Some of you have experienced the pain of the death of a family member&mdash;even the overwhelming grief associated with the loss of a little child. There have been dark and difficult days where you have poured out your soul to your Heavenly Father, asking for His assistance, deliverance, and comfort. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, in <em>all</em> of your experiences&mdash;your most exhilarating highs and your most devastating lows&mdash;and all the mundane, run-of-the-mill ones in between, God is aware of you. You are His child, and He loves you. Next only to the Atonement of His Son Jesus Christ, this fact should give us more hope than any other thing we can know or come to learn. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I just suggested to you that knowing you are a child of God and that He loves you should give you hope. And yet I confess to you that, personally, I struggle with this idea. How could the God of the universe be aware of me, let alone be personally interested in and invested in the details of my life? Of all the things He has created, how can He know and care for me? &nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, God taught Moses: "Behold, I am the Lord God&nbsp;Almighty, and&nbsp;Endless&nbsp;is my&nbsp;name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless? &nbsp;</p>
<p>"... I will show thee the&nbsp;workmanship&nbsp;of mine&nbsp;hands; but not all, for my&nbsp;works&nbsp;are without&nbsp;end.... &nbsp;</p>
<p>"... Worlds&nbsp;without number have I&nbsp;created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the&nbsp;Son&nbsp;I&nbsp;created&nbsp;them, which is mine&nbsp;Only&nbsp;Begotten" (Moses 1:3-4, 33). &nbsp;</p>
<p>After standing in God's presence and being taught these truths, Moses was overcome and left without strength for many hours, and when he recovered, "he said unto himself: Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing" (Moses 1:10). &nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be difficult for me to comprehend how an infinite God with infinite creations can be aware of and love me. I have pondered and studied how this can be. And in the process, I have been strengthened by truths found in the scriptures and taught repeatedly by our general auxiliary leaders and our prophets and apostles. I would like to share with you four truths that have been meaningful to me and reminded me that our Father in Heaven and our Savior, Jesus Christ, <em>do</em> know and love each of us individually. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Truth #1: He wants us to love and care for the things that He has blessed us with. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearly 20 years ago, my wife and I decided to build our own home. We had recently had our second child and were dreaming of a yard and space for our family to grow. We didn't have the money for a down payment on an existing home, and after much research, we learned about a program that would make it financially feasible for us to build a home. But it was an owner/builder program, which meant we would have to build the home ourselves. Along the way, there were many who gave us support and assistance&mdash;in particular my father, who would often drive from Pocatello, where he lives, down to Springville, Utah, where we were building. Every aspect of the building process was a learning experience and an experiment in saving money. For example, I decided that it wasn't worth the money to rent a crane for an afternoon to lift my roof trusses onto the house and set them in place. So I rigged up a system whereby I was able to swing up each truss individually onto the second story. This particular job was not a one-person job; I saved it for weekends when I had extra hands. When our home was completed and I would get up into the attic space for storage boxes, I would look at the trusses and think about that experience. It would come back to me in great detail. Oftentimes, late at night, I would just walk around the house, inside and outside, and look at every aspect of the house. I remembered the very first wall we stood up with plywood sheeting and how we celebrated our little patch of shade on a hot summer afternoon. I thought about nailing on shingles and laying bricks. I thought about leveling cabinets and cutting tile. I thought about pulling wire and calculating stair treads and risers. I thought about putting in insulation and staining woodwork. If you pointed at any part of my house, I could relate a specific memory of working in that very spot. Having done much of the work myself, I knew things that no one else knew about the details of the building process. I had invested a lot of time&mdash;and love&mdash;into my home, and none of it was insignificant to me. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="House 1" src="Images/about/1-KR-Devo.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><img alt="House 2" height="287" src="Images/about/2-KR-Devo.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><img alt="House 3" height="500" src="Images/about/3-KR-Devo.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><img alt="House 4" height="287" src="Images/about/4-KR-Devo.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><img alt="House 5" height="285" src="Images/about/5-KR-Devo.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><img alt="House 6" height="333" src="Images/about/6-KR-Devo.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><img alt="House 7" height="333" src="Images/about/7-KR-Devo.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><img alt="House 8" height="289" src="Images/about/8-KR-Devo.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p>In the eternal scheme of things, the effort and investment I put into my home really is insignificant. But I believe that God gave me that opportunity and prompted me to walk around my home slowly, recalling the details of the building process, to teach me. He has given me a family and wants me to invest in them and care for them as I participate in their building process. As we strive to be good stewards over the things He has given us, we learn to better understand, in small ways, how He loves us. It is a gift He has given to us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think your Father in Heaven remembers experiences He had with you when you lived with Him? When He looks at you now, do you think He remembers details of your progression before you came into this life? Do you think He views you as young and inexperienced, or old and wise? You are His child, and He has already invested great effort in you. He loves you.</p>
<p>I would like you to participate with me in a little activity. It doesn't require you to talk. In fact, it will work better if you don't. Please, very quietly, take out your phones. Now, think of someone you love, someone who is important and significant to you. What would a message of love from you mean to them right now? I would like you to send them a text that says this: "I love you because...." Then fill in something that is special to you about that person. Remember, no need to talk or visit; just text your message of love. I'm going to do the same thing. Let's take a few seconds to do that. &nbsp; Wasn't that great? We all need to know that we are loved. Your Heavenly Father loves you, and just as you have sent a message to let someone know that you love them, He will send you little messages-tender mercies, as Nephi calls</p>
<p>Wasn't that great? We all need to know that we are loved. Your Heavenly Father loves you, and just as you have sent a message to let someone know that you love them, He will send you little messages&mdash;tender mercies, as Nephi calls them&mdash;to let you know that He is aware of you and loves you. I know that if you will listen and open your heart to the tender feelings of the Spirit, you will receive those messages.</p>
<p>Truth #2: He knows our names and everything about us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the scriptures, there are many occasions in which it is clear that our Father in Heaven and our Savior, Jesus Christ, know us by name, know of our circumstances, and care about us individually. To Jeremiah he said, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee" (Jeremiah 1:5). He taught Isaiah, "I have called thee by name; thou art mine" (Isaiah 43:1). The Psalmist declares, "Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising" (Psalms 139:2). And to Moses He said, "I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight" (Exodus 33:12). Elder Neal A. Maxwell reminds us, "Have we not been reassured about the fall of one sparrow and that the very hairs of our heads are numbered?&nbsp;God is in the details! Just as the Lord knows all of His vast creations, He also knows and loves each in any crowd-indeed, He knows and loves each and all of mankind!" &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Elaine S. Dalton teaches us, "Did you know that Heavenly Father knows you personally&mdash;by name? The scriptures teach us that this is true. When Enos went into the woods to pray, he recorded, 'There came a voice unto me, saying:&nbsp;<em>Enos,</em>&nbsp;thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.'<sup> </sup>Moses not only prayed but also talked to God face-to-face, and God said to Moses, 'I have a work for thee,&nbsp;<em>Moses,</em>&nbsp;my son.'<sup> </sup>The Lord knew Jacob's name and changed it to<em>&nbsp;Israel</em>&nbsp;to more accurately reflect his mission on the earth.<sup> </sup>Similarly, He changed the names of Paul and Abraham and Sarah"<sup> </sup>(Elaine S. Dalton, "He Knows You by Name," <em>Ensign, </em>May 2005). &nbsp;</p>
<p>To me, one of the most significant examples of God knowing our names may be that of the Prophet Joseph Smith. You know the story. He was moved upon by the Spirit to pray in an effort to resolve his confusion about religion. In answer to that prayer, the first word spoken by God in this final dispensation was his name-Joseph. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This past week I invited you, through the devotional discussion board, to post a picture of someone you love. I asked you to place words on that picture. One word was this person's name. Many people, beside you, know this person by name. But I also asked you to place on the photo a few words describing things about that person, things that you knew about them because of your deep and tender relationship with them. Thank you for sharing these images. It was meaningful to me to look at them during the week. I can feel your love for these people as I read their names and the words you used to describe them. I wish we had time to look at all of them together. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I would like to show you an image I made. This is an image of Demetrius Tillis.</p>
<p><img alt="Demitri" height="654" src="Images/about/demetri-tillis.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p>I had the privilege of teaching and baptizing Demetri on my mission 27 years ago. I served in several other areas after meeting Demetri, and when I left my mission, I had lost contact with him and didn't know where he was. Demetri was special to me, and I have wondered many times over the years where he was and what was happening in his life. In recent years, I tried using social media and other online methods to find him. Each time, I came up blank. As I was preparing for this talk, he came to mind again. I tried again to find Demetri on Facebook. This time I found a Demetri Tillis Jr. in Milwaukee, where I served. He only recently joined Facebook. I sent him a message, and he replied. I learned that he was Demetri's son. I learned that Demetri passed away in 1997. His son sent me the picture I just showed you. After 27 years, I was able to make contact with his family 2 &frac12; weeks ago. I know that God knows Demetri. And I know that God knows me and sent me this tender mercy to let me know. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Truth #3: He gives us examples in the scriptures and in the lives of others because we can apply them to our own lives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi was given a heavy responsibility. From a young age, he was asked to be a leader in his family and, later, a leader for his entire people. He felt the weight of this stewardship and took it very seriously. One of my favorite scriptures is in 2 Nephi 33, as Nephi is closing out his record. It is his last testimony, and he writes about his deep love and sense of responsibility for his people. "But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great&nbsp;worth, and especially unto my people. For I&nbsp;pray&nbsp;continually for them by day, and mine&nbsp;eyes&nbsp;water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my cry.</p>
<p>"And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my people. And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong unto them; for it&nbsp;persuadeth&nbsp;them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life&nbsp;eternal" (2 Nephi 33:3-4). &nbsp;</p>
<p>This scripture took on a special meaning to me when I was serving as an elders quorum president. It was a very challenging calling for me. It was outside my comfort zone. We had many prospective elders, many of whom had not been to church since they were 12 or 13. I was worried about what to say and how to approach them. But I had a love and concern for them that I knew came to me directly as a result of my calling&mdash;because I had been set apart to shoulder that responsibility at that time and because of the priesthood keys that had been conferred upon me. They were "my people," and I loved them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier, again while thinking of his people, Nephi teaches us, "I did&nbsp;liken&nbsp;all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our&nbsp;profit&nbsp;and learning" (1 Nephi 19:23). While we may not experience exactly the same circumstances or outcomes as those we read about in the scriptures, those stories and the lessons learned apply to us. We can trust them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is true not only of people in the scriptures but of people closer to our time, sometimes people we know personally. Their circumstances and their stories can be instructive to us. If we listen with "ears to hear" and allow our hearts to feel gentle promptings, God will send us messages that are just for us as we learn from others' stories. I would like to show you a short video about the Saints that were asked to come from Logan in 1884 to settle in the Snake River Valley. Listen to the things they were promised. You may not be promised the exact same things, but God has made promises to you in the past, and He will make promises to you in the future. &nbsp; Truth #4: Because He knows us, He knows our potential and has great expectations for us. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Truth #4: Because He knows us, He knows our potential and has great expectations for us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught: "I testify to you that God has known you individually ... for a long, long time. He has loved you for a long, long time. He not only knows the names of all the stars; He knows your names and all your heartaches and your joys!" (Neal A. Maxwell, "Remember How Merciful the Lord Hath Been," <em>Ensign, </em>May 2004). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Father in Heaven knows more about us than we know about ourselves. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf declared: "You are known and remembered by the most majestic, powerful, and glorious Being in the universe! You are loved by the King of infinite space and everlasting time! &nbsp;</p>
<p>"He who created and knows the stars knows you and your name" (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "Forget Me Not," <em>Ensign, </em>Nov. 2011). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Because our Father in Heaven and our Savior, Jesus Christ, have known us "individually for a long, long time," They know perfectly of our strengths and potential. They know what we are capable of, and They have great confidence in us. When someone has great confidence in us, how do we respond? Abraham Lincoln wrote, "I'm a success today because I had a friend who believed in me and I didn't have the heart to let him down." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Father in Heaven believes in you. You have already demonstrated your greatness, and He knows you will rise to meet difficult challenges today and in the future. President Gordon B. Hinckley reminds us: "Yours is a godly inheritance. 'I am a child of God' is not an idle or meaningless statement. You were there 'when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons [and daughters] of God shouted for joy.' You brought some of that inheritance with you when you came 'trailing clouds of glory ... from God who is our home.' You were there when 'there was war in heaven.... &nbsp;</p>
<p>"You were among those who chose to follow the plan of Him who became our Redeemer rather than the plan of him who became our adversary. Great and marvelous is your place in the plan of God our Eternal Father" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "Rise to the Stature of the Divine within You," <em>Ensign, </em>Nov. 1989). &nbsp; As we close, I invite you to send one more text. Again, please do this reverently.

<p>President of BYU-Idaho</p>
<p>Henry Johnson Eyring was named the seventeenth president of Brigham Young University-Idaho on February 7, 2017, by Elder Dallin H. Oaks, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Church Board of Education.<br /> <br />Henry and his family have had a long association with Rexburg and BYU-Idaho. He first came to the Upper Snake River Valley as a child, when his father, President Henry B. Eyring, served as president of Ricks College. He and his family were in Rexburg to assist with the clean-up efforts following the Teton Dam disaster in 1976. &nbsp; <br /><br />Henry returned to Rexburg and the relatively new BYU-Idaho in 2006. Over the ensuing eleven years at the university, he has served as Associate Academic Vice President over Online Learning, Advancement Vice President, and Academic Vice President. &nbsp; <br /><br />Previous to his work at BYU-Idaho, Henry worked as a strategy consultant at Monitor Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and as MBA Director at BYU in Provo. &nbsp; <br /><br />Henry has served in various callings in the Church, including full-time missionary in the Japan&shy; &shy;Nagoya Mission, bishop, Mission President in the Tokyo Japan North Mission, and President of the Rexburg Idaho YSA 6<sup>th</sup> Stake. &nbsp; <br /><br />Henry earned a bachelor's degree in Geology, a Master of Business Administration, and a Juris Doctorate from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. While attending BYU, he married his high school sweetheart, Kelly Ann Child. They are the parents of five children, and they currently have two grandchildren. Their three oldest children are all graduates of BYU-Idaho, and all have been well served by their experience here.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Congratulations, graduates! I'm grateful for a few minutes to celebrate today's success and explore with you principles of long-term success and happiness. I've discovered these principles by personal trial and error. The errors can be summarized in three words that begin with the letter P: prestige, position, and pay.<br /> <br />As a young man, I thought a lot about prestige, position, and pay. I was self-conscious of my paternal grandfather, a prestigious scientist, and of my father's position as the president of Ricks College and then as a General Authority. I also admired the financial affluence of my maternal grandfather, on whose California estate I grew up, in the lap of luxury. <br /><br />Fortunately for me, my parents traded that luxury for the cold winters and dusty farm summers of Rexburg. Later, as a soon-to-graduate college student, I was similarly blessed by the disappointment of being denied my lifelong dream of going to the Harvard Business School, as my father did. I was devastated. <br /><br />However, by a series of subtle miracles, my first full-time job took me to Boston, home of Harvard. For a time, I enjoyed the pay, positions of power, and prestige to which I had aspired as a boy. <br /><br />Yet after five successful years, heaven blessed me with apparent setbacks. My professional work changed. I made progressively less money while moving from one job to another. My hairstyle also changed, dramatically. It was a period of personal trial and humiliation. <br /><br />Thankfully, along the way I developed a measure of genuine humility and faith, the kind that comes only through testing. Dear family members and friends lifted me. And I was blessed with new professional causes that engaged my mind and heart, notwithstanding job titles that were hard to explain. <br /><br />Looking back on these experiences, I've gratefully seen how the Lord gave me three other Ps to guide my life in the path of lasting happiness: people, places, and puzzles. I began to discover the value of people, places, and puzzles, thanks to a rare decision made when I finished school. Blessed with two job offers, both from Boston-based companies, I uncharacteristically chose the less prestigious one. During interviews with both companies on the same day, I was drawn to the smaller, less formal group and their quirky offices, which reminded me of a friendly college dormitory. I felt at home with them. <br /><br />This company offered a handsome salary, and it soon promoted me into leadership positions. However, later, after I had made a substantial financial investment as a partner in the company, it had to declare bankruptcy. Following only a moment's temptation to join in a lawsuit against the company's founders, I remembered my love for them and the lasting satisfaction of solving important puzzles together. By comparison, my financial loss seemed inconsequential. <br /><br />Looking back, I now see that prestige, position, and pay are subject to diminishing returns-in other words, for each additional investment made to obtain these tantalizing rewards, the lasting value received in return is less. By contrast, my investments in people, places, and puzzles seem to yield greater satisfaction the more I put into them. <br /><br />And heaven seems to multiply my productivity. During five years in Massachusetts, for example, I received five Church leadership callings and, largely through home teaching, participated in more convert baptisms than I did as a full-time missionary. The people I served and the puzzles we solved together give me inexpressible love for that place. <br /><br />I briefly enjoyed both these rewards and also the professional trappings of prestige, position, and pay. But in hindsight I can see the price paid by my young family and particularly by Sister Eyring. Investments in prestige, position, and pay not only yield diminishing returns; they also tend to crowd out investments in people, places, and puzzles. Priorities must be established and choices made. <br /><br />As the ghost of Jacob Marley told his former business partner Ebenezer Scrooge, "Mankind was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The deals of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!" The Savior expressed the same principle more optimistically: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his&nbsp;righteousness; and all these&nbsp;things&nbsp;shall be&nbsp;added&nbsp;unto you."<a href="/speeches/president-henry-j-eyring-spring-commencement-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> <br /><br />I bear testimony of that, commending to you a life of people, places, and puzzles. I also add my blessing upon you, promising lasting happiness as you seek first the kingdom of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>It is a joy to be with you on this very special day. I express my love for you and my happiness for you. This is a day of joy and happiness, a day of hope and love. It is also a day of beginnings and anticipations. <br /><br />You all have important work to do in the years ahead. You all have much joy to experience and much to learn. You all have many people to love and to serve. There are people whom you do not know, perhaps even eternal companions and children, whose lives you will bless and even save in a coming day. &nbsp; <br /><br />You will see many miracles and wonders and great light in God's kingdom in the years ahead. And, of course, you will see much darkness, evil, and wickedness. These are the last days. &nbsp; <br /><br />You will face many distractions and temptations. You already know many of them. There will be more, and it will be more difficult to stay on the path that leads to joy, peace, and happiness in this life, and eternal life and exaltation in the world to come. Yet you are highly favored of the Lord Jesus Christ. If you are true to your covenants, He will bless you, strengthen you, and lift you up all the days of your life. &nbsp; <br /><br />On this day of beginnings, I invite you to resolve to establish patterns of righteousness in your everyday lives that will anchor you to the Lord Jesus Christ, to His everlasting gospel, and to His Church and kingdom on the earth. I have in mind patterns like praying morning and night, obeying the commandments, repenting, searching the word of God, serving the Lord, worshipping in the temple, and following the promptings of the Holy Spirit. &nbsp; <br /><br />Today I want to focus on one of these patterns. It is this: Follow the prophet. Speaking of His Prophet, the Lord Jesus Christ said: &nbsp; <br /><br />"Thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me; &nbsp; <br /><br />"For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith."<a href="/speeches/elder-kim-b-clark-spring-commencement-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Here is a very recent and very important example. Last April, President Thomas S. Monson, the Lord's prophet, said: &nbsp; <br /><br />"My dear associates in the work of the Lord, I implore each of us to prayerfully study and ponder the Book of Mormon each day. As we do so, we will be in a position to hear the voice of the Spirit, to resist temptation, to&nbsp;overcome doubt and fear, and to receive heaven's help in our lives."<a href="/speeches/elder-kim-b-clark-spring-commencement-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a></p>
<p>And so, tonight, I encourage you to accept and act on this invitation from the Lord's prophet. Take this book, the Book of Mormon, into your hands every day. Read it, study it, ponder and pray about what you learn, every single day. &nbsp; <br /><br />The Book of Mormon was written for our day. It was written to us by ancient prophets who saw us and our lives and times. It was preserved by the hand of the Lord and translated by the gift and power of God so that you could read it, learn from it, and pray about it every day. It will speak to your personal life and bless you every day. &nbsp; <br /><br />The most important and most powerful blessing of the Book of Mormon is its sure witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. Nephi, Mormon, and Moroni knew that in our day false prophets and apostates would arise to deny the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ, the divine call of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the Lord's Church. And so these great prophets who saw and talked with the Savior face to face bore powerful, sacred witness that He lives and that the book they produced, the Book of Mormon, is true.<a href="/speeches/elder-kim-b-clark-spring-commencement-2017#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />My dear brothers and sisters, I have done what I am asking you to do. I bear solemn witness that if you will prayerfully read and study the Book of Mormon every day, you will gain a witness of its truth. You will know, as I know, through the power of the Holy Ghost that this book is the word of the Lord to you in your day; that Jesus is the Christ; that Joseph Smith is His Prophet; and that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true. It is all true. &nbsp; <br /><br />I leave you with my love and my hope that each of you will establish patterns of righteousness in your daily lives, that you will follow the prophet and read the Book of Mormon every day. I bear you my witness that just as the prophet declared, you will hear the voice of the Spirit; you will resist temptation, overcome doubt and fear, and receive heaven's help in your life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>General Authority Seventy</p>
<p>Elder J. Devn Cornish was sustained as a General Authority Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 2, 2011. At the time of his call, he had been serving as a member of the Sixth Quorum of the Seventy in the North America Southeast Area. He is currently serving as the Assistant Executive Director of the Church History Department.<br /><br />Elder Cornish received a bachelor of arts in biology from Johns Hopkins University in 1975. In 1978, he received a doctor of medicine, also from Johns Hopkins University. He completed his pediatric residency at the Boston Children's Hospital at Harvard University in 1981. In 1985, he completed a neonatology fellowship program at Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center. Subsequently, he was Professor and Chairman, and later a Vice Chairman in the Department of Pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Cornish has served in numerous Church callings, including full-time missionary in the Guatemala-El Salvador Mission, elders quorum president, ward executive secretary, ward mission leader, ward Young Men president, bishop, high priests group leader, stake president, president of the Dominican Republic Santiago Mission (2003-2006), and Area Seventy. &nbsp; <br /><br />John Devn Cornish was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on April 12, 1951. He married Elaine Simmons in August 1973. They are the parents of six children.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Beloved sisters and brothers, it is exhilarating for Sister Cornish and me to be with you, and we feel sincerely honored to be able to share your moment of achievement and triumph. We congratulate you most sincerely on your graduations. <br /><br />Being back in Idaho reminds me of the apocryphal story of the Idaho bishop who was released after serving for 17 years. Following the vote of thanks, the stake president asked him to come up to the podium. Putting his arm around the bishop, the president asked, "So, Bishop, what do you plan to do now that you've been released?" The bishop paused for a minute and said, "I've got a rocking chair on my front porch. I plan to sit in it for the next 7 years." Surprised, the president asked, "Well, Bishop, what do you plan to do after 7 years?" The bishop replied, "If I've got the energy, I'm gonna start to rock!" &nbsp; <br /><br />Happily, most of you are at the early stages of many of your service experiences. That being the case, I have pondered and prayed much to know what the Lord might have me say that might be of help to you. I have come to conclude that the most useful words I could give you are two. Let me explain. &nbsp; <br /><br />In John 8:28, the Savior defines a key element in His relationship to His Heavenly Father. We read, "Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things."<br /><br />So Jesus said or did whatever His Father taught Him; He did what His Father told Him to do. This exact obedience is a hallmark of their relationship. Heavenly Father could count on His Son obeying Him. &nbsp; <br /><br />Obviously, in a much more minor way, I can claim to have been fully obedient to my mother in one of the things she used to tell me to do. In our family of six children, each of us had assigned tasks, or "chores," to do, one of which included washing and drying the dishes after dinner each evening. For some reason, it was one of the chores we children dreaded the most. I can report to you that as a child, there was not a single night when I did not obey my mother's direction to do the dishes before going to bed--simply because she wouldn't have allowed me to! So, in the spirit of full disclosure, I also have to confess that the amount of grief I caused my mother before I actually did the dishes some evenings is a source of real embarrassment to me now. I whined, I made excuses, I feigned illness, I watched one more television program, or played just one more game with my friends, etc., etc., etc. But I was technically obedient--in the end I did what she told me to do. &nbsp; <br /><br />Latter-day Saint leaders, and especially mission presidents, are often heard to say that obedience is the first law of heaven--which is true. But it is not the last law of heaven; it is not the end goal! That person who is forever fixated on obedience and has to decide from event to event and from moment to moment whether or not he or she will obey will largely live a miserable, Mosaic sort of life! &nbsp; <br /><br />Happily, there is more in the Savior's teaching in John 8. In verse 29 we read, "And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him." Here is the higher standard. Here we learn that Jesus did not only those things His Father told Him to do but also "those things that please[d]" His Father. &nbsp; <br /><br />To understand the difference, let's go back to the example of doing the dishes after dinner. At some time in our growing-up years as children, my oldest sister made a game-changing discovery. She figured out that she could jump up from the dinner table, put away the food, wash and dry the dishes, clean off the countertops, sweep the floor, and be off to play with her friends in much less time than it took the rest of us to whine and complain about washing the dishes! But she had learned something even more important; she had learned to not only obey our mother by doing what she was told but to please her by also doing other things that she knew our mother would really like her to do. &nbsp; <br /><br />The two words I would like to gift to you today, the ones that I believe will be of the utmost importance and help in your future life, are these: "Please God." &nbsp; <br /><br />There are so many decisions we must make in life. Most of them don't have lasting or profound consequences, but some of them will change all of eternity for ourselves and others! Moreover, the hard and fast rules are notoriously imprecise at times that we seem to need them most. These two words can guide most any decision in life in inspired and precise ways. &nbsp; <br /><br />Let me give you an example. Suppose some years from now, you have a teenage daughter who is planning to attend a high-school dance with a guy she really likes and wants to impress. As she bounces down the stairs past your chair, your attention is drawn to her dress, which makes you feel more than a bit uncomfortable. You stop your daughter and say, "Honey, I'm not sure that dress is as modest as your mother and I would like it to be." Your daughter instantly becomes defensive, and the conversation turns to pharisaical rules about inches up and inches down and about loose and tight. In such situations, strict obedience to some rule may not really solve the problem. &nbsp; <br /><br />Suppose that instead your comment to this young daughter as she bounces down the stairs were, "Honey, you look as lovely as always, but I wonder whether you and your Heavenly Father have had a conversation about the modesty of your dress? Would you be willing to take just a few minutes and find out for sure if He is pleased with it? Like you, your mother and I are just trying to do those things that will please our Heavenly Father." &nbsp; <br /><br />Thus, as parents you might bypass many of the contentions and conundrums of life by rising from the first law of heaven, obedience, to the ultimate law of heaven, consecration. &nbsp; <br /><br />Can you see that in matters of modesty and morals every difficult decision becomes simple and clear if the standard we follow is just to please God? The same is true in questions of honesty and integrity, including matters ranging from business ethics to filing your tax return. This standard applies in our interpersonal relationships and communications, including things ranging from flirting to boasting. In fact, I believe that a person's decision to "do always those things that please" God will help direct him or her through virtually every pitfall and snare in life. &nbsp; <br /><br />The reason I believe that is because God's standards are higher than man's standards, and, as Isaiah said, His "ways are higher than [our] ways" (Isaiah 55:9). At BYU-Idaho, you speak of producing graduates who will be "natural leaders." Imagine how this standard would elevate the performance and success of a leader in any field and lead to professional, personal, and spiritual excellence. &nbsp; <br /><br />Like many of you, I came to a time in my life when I needed to make a decision about where to focus my efforts as I dated a number of remarkable young women. After studying the matter out in my mind, I approached the Lord in sincere prayer. It was not a question of there being a "one and only" person I could marry--I think it rarely is. Rather, the Lord kindly blessed me to know that He would be pleased if a certain young woman and I were to become eternal companions. I knew that that decision was pleasing to the Lord. When I discovered--to my absolute amazement and delight--that it was pleasing to her as well, that is exactly what we did. And we now have 6 children, 31 grandchildren, and a life of joy and meaning to show for our efforts over the past nearly 44 years! &nbsp; <br /><br />When faced with decisions about a career, I suppose I confronted about the same multiplicity of options as most of you, but I came to know that my Heavenly Father would be pleased if I became a pediatrician. However, I was also given to know that our Father would prefer for me to pursue some personalized paths of excellence beyond the usual, if I would make the effort. I went to work, and the opportunities and blessings that opened up were magnificent! &nbsp; <br /><br />You may take comfort from the fact that Heavenly Father will help you know what pleases Him. He wants you to please Him, because He really wants to give you all He has. He will let you know if you really ask and if you really listen. Admittedly, sometimes He makes us work for an answer so that when He teaches us His will, we will really follow through, but He wants to guide us. A second related truth is that Heavenly Father, through His Son, and through the Holy Ghost, will help you do the things that please Him. He will open doors, He will magnify your gifts and talents, He will strengthen you and bless you to become what He wants you to become. &nbsp; <br /><br />Please don't misunderstand what this standard entails. To please God rarely, if ever, means doing things the easy way or doing things the way you want to just because it is comfortable. To please God generally means:</p>
<p>In all of this, beware of competing with or comparing yourself to others! It never was, nor is it now, God's goal for you to be better than someone else or even to be like someone else. From 1897 to 1899, young David O. McKay was serving as a missionary in Scotland. He later recounted the following life-changing experience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I remember as a missionary in Scotland fifty-seven years ago ... I confess I was homesick.... As we returned to the town [one day], I saw an unfinished building standing back from the sidewalk several yards. Over the front door was a stone arch, something unusual in a residence, and what was still more unusual, I could see from the sidewalk that there was an inscription chiseled in that arch. I said to my companion: "That's unusual! I am going to see what the inscription is." When I approached near enough, this message came to me, not only in stone, but as if it came from One in whose service we were engaged: "Whate'er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part."</p>
<p>Continuing from President McKay,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That was a message to me that morning to act my part well as a missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<a href="/speeches/elder-j-devn-cornish-sring-commencement-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p>
<p>Please understand, we will best please God when we do well the part each of us was individually sent to <em>this</em> place on this earth at <em>this</em> time to fulfill. But whatever our part--whether plumber or principal or prophet--the Lord expects us to do it well. &nbsp; <br /><br />There are no small people or small parts. There are parts played well and parts not played so well. As a physician, I can tell you what is the most important part of your body: whichever part is hurting or is not functioning at the moment! Truly, the body has need of every part, and the Father's plan needs the fully consecrated efforts of every person. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now I would like to give you a promise and a warning before you take these two sentinel words, "Please God," as your guide. What our Father desires for each of us is a fulness of the growth, wisdom, blessings to ourselves and others, and joy that this life and the next have to offer. But those things don't come from taking the easy path! &nbsp; <br /><br />In 1832 there was a young man living in Mendon, New York, who had been raised in considerable poverty. He was the ninth of 11 children, and his parents really did not have the means to feed them all. Accordingly, he was apprenticed out to a painter and carpenter after his mother died when he was 14 years old. In due time he earned his independence, fell in love with and married the girl of his dreams, and was making a pretty good living as a painter and glazier and furniture maker. His wife bore him two beautiful little daughters, but her health began to deteriorate from a malady known in those days as "consumption" and now called tuberculosis. As his wife's health gradually worsened, he cared lovingly for her and the children in her invalid years. When his wife did die, he was left to try to work full-time and raise the two little girls with some help from nearby friends. He probably had no more lofty ambitions in life at that time than to be an honest tradesman, a good father, and to learn and follow truth. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now tell me, would anyone have reason to find fault with this good man if he continued to live an honest, hard-working, Christian life, seeking truth and raising his two daughters to be honorable and to love God? Perhaps not, but, in this case, the Lord had something more in mind for him. If we take "Please God" as our standard, our Heavenly Father could have been deeply troubled by such a course, because this good man was Brigham Young, and he had within him the potential to do much more, to be much more, and to bless many more people than he would have if he had continued to live the quiet life of a carpenter and painter in Mendon, New York! &nbsp; <br /><br />You see, our task is to be all that God wants <em>us</em> to be and to do all that God wants <em>us</em> to do--that is, to act well <em>our</em> part. I believe that this is the key to realizing the vision that prophets and other leaders have declared for the graduates of BYU-Idaho. &nbsp; <br /><br />Think how exciting the implications are for your future contributions to your families, the Church, and your professions! Those who please God will make a difference in whatever their spheres of influence turn out to be because they will have integrity, they will be excellent at what they do, and they will be sincerely caring or compassionate toward their associates. People with integrity, excellence, and compassion are inspired to set for themselves standards or expectations for their own performance that far exceed those established by their jobs or institutions, the Church, or even their families. This endows them with the tremendous freedom of action enjoyed by the self-employed because they are not limited by the expectations of the job or institution but, in a sense, work for themselves based on their personal standards and, in a greater sense, for the Lord and for what He envisions for the souls involved. This in turn frees them to innovate under inspiration based on a deep understanding of the core purposes of the institution and of the origins and workings of the fundamental problems and opportunities it faces. It also allows solutions to be framed in ways that empower, reward, and bless all the affected parties, not just a "leadership team" or a favored few, because God really wants all of His children to be blessed as often and as broadly as possible. &nbsp; <br /><br />I rejoice in the visionary institution BYU-Idaho is. I celebrate the quality and goodness of its graduates, such as you. And I praise the impact you will have across the earth and throughout your lives as you help to bring the Father's will to pass globally by your commitment to please God personally. I testify of these principles and witness that Jesus Christ lives and directs this work, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p><strong>Scriptures: </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. I am thankful to be with you on this day at the start of this summer session at BYU-Idaho. I am grateful that each of you has made the decision to participate in this devotional, and I hope that you will continue to make devotional a priority during your time here. I know that small and simple actions, like choosing to attend a weekly devotional, can have significant impacts in our lives.<br /><br />At the beginning of this meeting, President Burgener asked that we hold up our scriptures to show that we are prepared to be taught today. That tradition was started by Elder Bednar at the beginning of his tenure as president of Ricks College in the fall of 1997, which was my first semester at Ricks. In January of 1998, Elder Bednar gave a remarkable address on the value of personal scripture study, where he taught that studying the scriptures is important to us because of the covenants we have made, the direction we need, and that scripture study is a prerequisite for personal revelation.[i] I would like to add that regular devotional attendance enhances our study.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today I would like to speak with you on the topic of support, specifically that support that we receive from others and the support that we can provide to others. Support can mean bearing the weight of something, holding up, giving assistance, sustaining, assisting, carrying, comforting, or strengthening. Please note the different times where I use the word <em>support</em> and the different situations and circumstances where support was either received or provided.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am humbled to have the opportunity to speak to you on this day. July 25 is a special day for my family. Three years ago today, my grandmother Dorla Jenkins passed away. &nbsp;<br /><br />She was a special woman whose Christ-centered life was a rich testimony of faith, work, and love. She was a great support to many throughout her life. My grandmother was born in 1935 to industrious farming and ranching parents whose lineage connects me to over 160 pioneer ancestors, whom I am especially grateful for as we have just celebrated Pioneer Day here in this valley.&nbsp;<br /><br />To Dorla Rudd Jenkins, the world of 1935, as seen from the back of a cow pony, was a very different place than it is today. This is a picture of her sitting on her horse Roxy in 1940.</p>
<p><img alt="young girl on horse" height="240" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/young-girl-on-horse_300x240.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>I'm guessing that most of us were not in a saddle, riding horses, at five; my grandmother was. She had a love for horses that she passed to my 13-year-old daughter, Brynn, who is on the stand today. &nbsp;<br /><br />A large portion of who and what we are, the things we love, how we act, and the way we treat one another is instilled into our hearts and minds through the words and actions of our ancestors.</p>
<p><img alt="Teenage girl on horse" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Teenage-girl-on-horse_300x300.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />In 1969 my grandmother was hired to teach English here on this campus. In other terms, she was hired to be a support to the tens of thousands of students who would go through her classes. That support meant that she would transfer knowledge and skills she had learned to them, the students, and teach them how to apply that knowledge in the world they would face-simple concepts like the correct placement of a comma, to difficult lifelong decisions like understanding faith, the power of prayer, or the strength of the priesthood. She spent the next 30 years teaching English, poetry, creative writing, and some religion courses. In those classes, the lessons she taught were, in effect, the same lessons I and her family were taught in her home. She loved this campus, loved the students whom she taught, and she loved the gospel. She would often bear her testimony by saying, "The gospel is true. I know it and <em>I would walk into the fire for it.</em>" I can still hear her saying those words, and I never doubted that she meant what she said. &nbsp;<br /><br />My grandmother had a great love for the scriptures; they were her support. She learned through difficult trials that often all we have to turn to is the Lord. She turned to Him and the messages of the Book of Mormon prophets. At a young age, and by result of a tragic accident, she became a widow, which she was for over 50 years. She lived alone for most of her life. I can remember many times stopping by her home and finding her studying her scriptures. She underlined, took notes, looked for answers to questions in obscure reference books and through fervent prayer.</p>
<p><img alt="Scripture page with notes written in the columns" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Scripture-page-one_200x300.jpg" width="200" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="Scripture page with notes written in the columns" height="320" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Scripture-page-2_200x320.jpg" width="200" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Scripture notes" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Scripture-page-3_300x200.jpg" width="300" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="Scripture page with notes written in the columns" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Scripture-Page-4_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />She knew the doctrines of the gospel; they were a part of her life. She taught the truths she learned from the scriptures, by word and by action, to her children and grandchildren. As one of the oldest grandsons, I was especially blessed to live within a mile of her home and to be the recipient of the wisdom gleaned from her many years of study. Through her deep understanding of the doctrines of Christ, she was a great support to her family, her community, to Ricks College, to the Church, and to me. &nbsp;<br /><br />My grandmother loved teaching the stories of the Book of Mormon. One of my favorite stories that she taught was the account of Helaman's two thousand stripling warriors. This group was a support unit. It was never big enough or experienced enough to really be an army. They were simply support, young men placed in a very difficult situation at a crucial time in Nephite history. &nbsp;<br /><br />To begin our study of this group, I want to first focus on who these young men were. The word <em>stripling</em> is not often used in our language today. When we picture the two thousand stripling warriors, we often think of an image like this: nearly grown men, maybe 20 to 25 years old, large in stature, who had spent hours in the gym training and preparing for battle.</p>
<p><img alt="2000 warriors marching" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/2000-stripling-worriers-marching_200x300.jpg" width="200" /><br /><br />However, the American Dictionary of 1828 helps us understand what the word really meant when Joseph used it in translation. <em>Stripling</em> refers to a teenage boy at a particular time in his physical development: "[a] youth in the state of adolescence; a lad," or "a tall slender youth, one that shoots up suddenly."[ii]&nbsp;<br /><br />In today's times, a stripling young man might be found in our priests and teachers quorums. Picture a younger brother, relative, or someone from your home ward who is a priest or teacher. They are in that awkward physical time between boyhood and manhood when they are very capable but not fully grown, developed, or mature. Based on this understanding, these two thousand stripling warriors would have looked more like this. They would have been strong young men who were physically active, but not mature, prepared warriors. Helaman often referred to the group as his "little sons."[iii] This context helps us better realize who this group was, the faith that they had, and the support that they were able to become.</p>
<p><img alt="Mother hugging teenage sons" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Mother-hugging-teenage-sons_225x300.jpg" width="225" /><br /><br />In chapter 23 of Alma, we learn of the fathers and mothers of these two thousand young men: a group of Lamanites who, through the missionary work of the sons of Mosiah, were converted unto the Lord: "And thousands were brought to the knowledge of the Lord ... and were converted unto the Lord.... &nbsp;<br /><br />"For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more, neither against any of their brethren."[iv]<br /><br />&nbsp;To fully grasp the change that came to these Lamanites through their conversion to the Lord, we need to recognize who they were prior to hearing the gospel. Ammon referred to them as a "stiffnecked" people, "whose hearts delight in the shedding of blood; whose days have been spent in the grossest iniquity; whose ways have been the ways of a transgressor from the beginning."[v] &nbsp;These once wicked and bloodthirsty men, who thrived in battle, believed what they heard and were taught by the sons of Mosiah through the Holy Ghost. With their conversion, these people, called the people of Ammon, covenanted with God that they would never again take up arms in battle against their brethren, even if that meant laying down their lives. Their conversion and the covenants that they made with God changed every aspect of who they were. In Alma 27 we learn of their actions after becoming converted and making covenants with God: "They were also distinguished for their <em>zeal</em> towards God, <em>and also towards men;</em> for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end."[vi]<br /><br />&nbsp;The word <em>zeal</em> means great energy or enthusiasm in pursuit of a cause. And the zeal that they had was not just for God, but it was also for their fellowmen. This was a complete transformation. They became a righteous people united in their faith and their covenants. Their conversion to the gospel is a lesson in opposites: sin to holiness, hatred to love, and death to life. These converted Lamanites experienced a complete change, and the sons from this group would later become the two thousand stripling warriors.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I pause from this story for just a moment to talk about covenants and their importance in our lives. Covenants are sacred promises that bind us spiritually to God. In making covenants, we promise to our Heavenly Father that we will live and act in accordance with His will, and in return we are promised blessings that can only come from Him, such as eternal life. &nbsp;<br /><br />God has long made covenants with his people. Through the Restoration of the gospel, we have opportunities to make covenants with God at the waters of baptism, when we partake of the sacrament, and ultimately in the holy temples. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has said: "In a way it is the most fundamental thing we can discuss in the gospel plan, because only covenant makers and covenant keepers can claim the ultimate blessings of the celestial kingdom. Yes, when we talk about covenant keeping, we are talking about the heart and soul of our purpose in mortality."[vii]&nbsp;<br /><br />Covenants drive action and change behaviors. Covenants drove this extremely devoted group of Saints in their desires to live righteously. Speaking of covenants, Elder M. Russell Ballard said: "Sometimes we are tempted to let our lives be governed more by convenience than by covenant. It is not always convenient to live gospel standards and stand up for truth and testify of the Restoration.... But there is no spiritual power in living by convenience. The power comes as we keep our covenants."[viii]<br /><br />&nbsp;Power comes from making and keeping covenants for us today just as it did for the Ammonites. With their covenants came support-support from scripture, support from the prophets and leaders, support from their families, and support from one another. Remember the covenants that you have made and that you will yet make, and commit to live by those covenants throughout your life. Choose covenant over convenience.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Fast-forward some 16 years from the time that these Lamanites were converted, and not much has changed in the land. Though these men and women had made dramatic changes, the world about them did not change. The Lamanites are still contending with the Nephites, and many thousands have lost their lives in these battles. Moroni is chief captain of the Nephite armies, and he has spent years fortifying cities and defending his people against the Lamanites. &nbsp;<br /><br />In 66 b.c. Moroni and the bulk of the Nephite army were marching north to assist Teancum in retaking several cities that the Nephites had lost, including Bountiful, the capital city. Moroni left smaller contingents of his army to protect the Nephite lands to the south and the west, which included the land of Jershon, where the Ammonites lived. &nbsp;<br /><br />Knowing the armies were divided, the Lamanites began attacking the weakened parts of the land and obtained possession of a number of cities. These battles greatly weakened the smaller armies of the Nephites and threatened their entire existence. &nbsp;<br /><br />This was a very difficult time for the Ammonites. It had been 16 years from the time that they became converted and made their covenants with God, 16 years of time during which they had been protected by the Nephites. They felt guilty that they were not fighting. The 13th verse of the 53rd chapter of Alma elaborates: "When they saw the danger, and the many afflictions and <em>tribulations</em> which the Nephites bore for them, they were moved with compassion and were desirous to take up arms."[ix]&nbsp;<br /><br />The word <em>tribulation</em> should not be passed over lightly. <em>Tribulation</em> is a very powerful word; it means a state of great trouble or suffering. They were suffering, their families were suffering, and the Nephites were suffering. Can you imagine the feelings of these men, who had once been warriors?&nbsp;<br /><br />They wanted to help. They were willing to once again take up arms, but they had covenanted not to. Imagine the turmoil that they would have felt, not only as individuals but as a group, a priesthood quorum. Now, it is interesting to note that the cause for which they wanted to act was a righteous and good cause. They wanted to defend themselves; they wanted to defend their families; they wanted to support those who were fighting for them; and they were, as the scripture says, "moved with compassion." But even though their cause and their intentions were right and just, taking up arms once again would have been breaking their covenants with God. They were tempted in that moment to let their lives "be governed more by convenience than by covenant," as Elder Ballard said.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Alma 53 we learn what happens next: "But behold, as they were about to take their weapons of war, they were overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman..., for <em>they were about to break the oath</em> which they had made. &nbsp;<br /><br />"And Helaman feared lest by so doing they should <em>lose their souls.</em>"[x]&nbsp;<br /><br />In this crucial moment for these converted followers of Christ, they were guided by a prophet of God. Helaman was a prophet, the high priest over the Church. He understood the importance of covenants. Even though the armies of the Nephites were weakened and they needed the support and help of this once fearsome band of warriors, he knew the significance of covenant over convenience. The people of Ammon, this quorum of stalwart men, followed the counsel of a living prophet and did not break their covenants.&nbsp;<br /><br />We too have prophets of God living today. These modern-day prophets lead the Lord's Church and provide support-or, as we normally say, guidance and direction-to us. I know that we will never be led astray when we follow the prophets. &nbsp;<br /><br />When I was a teenager, my dad was serving as a bishop here on campus. He really enjoyed this calling, but I wasn't such a big fan. To me, all that it meant was that there were groups of college kids at our house all of the time and extra meetings to attend. I remember one Sunday, October 29, 1995-I know the exact date because my grandmother made note of the meeting in her scriptures-being dragged by my dad here to campus to attend a regional conference. I wasn't excited about having to go to this extra meeting. The conference was held in the Hart gymnasium, and I sat on a back row in the red seats. I don't remember much from the conference except that the main speaker, and presiding officer, at the meeting was President Gordon B. Hinckley, then the First Counselor in the First Presidency. Toward the end of his remarks, President Hinckley pounded his fist on the pulpit and said, "The Lord will not let His Church be led astray. If I were to attempt to do so, the Lord would remove me from my place." On that day, the Holy Ghost testified to my heart that prophets are real. My dad was supporting me, against my immature judgment, by bringing me to a place where he knew that a prophet of God would be. And that prophet of God bore testimony of the work, and it was delivered to me personally by the Holy Ghost, the third member of the Godhead.&nbsp;<br /><br />As the people of Ammon chose to follow the counsel of the prophet, a remarkable event took place. They realized that there were a large number of young men, their sons, who had not entered into the same covenant that they had to lay down their weapons of war. About two thousand of these, their young sons, assembled together and then entered into a new covenant with God that they would fight for their liberty and in defense of their lands and their brethren. They committed to providing the support that the Nephites desperately needed. &nbsp;<br /><br />Now imagine, with me, you are a father or a mother of these young men. You are in your late 30s or early 40s. You are a once-hardened warrior who is still very capable of bearing arms. You are witnessing your sons, much younger, much weaker, and with little or no experience in the horrors of war, volunteer to fight a battle that you are much more prepared to fight than they are. You are standing and watching your young sons march off to defend the nation, to defend you. Can you now better understand tribulation and the significance of covenants? These parents were willing to watch their little sons depart for war because of their covenants. Even with the faith that these followers of Christ had, they had to have wondered if they would ever see their young sons again. Do we have the same level of commitment to keeping our covenants?&nbsp;<br /><br />The scriptures teach us much about these young men. We learn that they had been taught to keep the commandments; that they were obedient, faithful, valiant; and that they did not doubt the things that they had been taught "by their mothers."[xi] These young men were willing to show their faith by taking up arms and going to battle to support the Nephites. &nbsp;<br /><br />We live in a world today filled with doubt and uncertainty. As levels of faith decrease in the world, our levels of faith as individuals within the Church need to increase. Never feel ashamed because of your faith. Never feel like you are missing out on something because you have faith. Never believe that your faith is holding you back or limiting your ability to live your life. Just as these young men did not doubt the things that they had been taught, we need to learn to follow the counsel from President Uchtdorf, who encouraged us to "doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith."[xii] Your faith can support you just as it supported the individuals within this group of two thousand. &nbsp;<br /><br />One of the things that I love about this powerful story is that as these young men assembled themselves together and entered into covenant, they asked Helaman to be their leader. That action may seem inconsequential, but it was an extremely important decision-a decision that highlights the great faith that these young men had, because Helaman was a prophet, a missionary, the high priest over the Church, but he was not an experienced war captain like Moroni. &nbsp;<br /><br />In fact, prior to this event, there aren't any accounts of Helaman leading an army or participating in battles. We can assume that there would have been other men who were more seasoned in battle that would have been more logical choices to lead this young, inexperienced army; but the young men had faith that if they followed the prophet, even into a battle that they could not have felt prepared for, they would be protected. Helaman, the prophet, was the support for these young sons and for their parents during this very challenging time. Likewise, our prophets and apostles today can and will provide support for us during our trials and our challenges. &nbsp;<br /><br />You will face challenges in your life; of this there is no doubt. During this preparatory experience in mortality, we will all experience trials, stress, hardships, difficulties, pains, and disappointments. Trials can and will come even when we are doing all the right things, like the righteous people of Ammon were doing. The question for each of us is, "How do I respond to the challenges that I face?" &nbsp;<br /><br />Thirteen years ago this month, my wife Kristy's little brother Derrick was tragically killed in an ATV accident one Saturday morning when he was with his friends. He was a BYU-Idaho student who had just returned home from his mission. His sudden passing was a great trial that was unexpectedly thrust upon my wife, her parents, and the rest of the family. This was a difficult experience; it wasn't easy to process the tragedy. It would have been very easy, and even understandable, for his family members to ask why, to blame, to become bitter or angry, and to lose faith. They could have chosen to take that path-but they didn't. Never once have I heard Kristy, her parents, or anyone else in the family question, complain, or express bitterness about what happened. Instead, they chose to accept what happened and to move forward with faith, not letting that difficult experience become a stumbling block for them. It was tough. It hurt then, and it still does today, but they chose the better path-the path of having faith in a loving Heavenly Father, in His plan, in the covenants they have made, and in the knowledge that they will see Derrick again. They provided support to each other, and they received support from the scriptures, the words of the prophets, the Atonement of Christ, their friends and family members, and keeping their covenants.&nbsp;<br /><br />When you experience trials-again, not<em> if,</em> but <em>when</em>-remember the counsel the Lord gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith when he was facing a difficult time: "... Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.... &nbsp;<br /><br />"Therefore, <em>hold on thy way, </em>... for God shall be with you forever and ever."[xiii]<br /><br />I love that guidance. When you face a challenge or are experiencing a hard time, "hold on thy way," like my wife and her family did. God, your Father in Heaven, will be your support "forever and ever" as you "hold on thy way" and believe in Him. &nbsp;<br /><br />Now we return once again to the two thousand stripling warriors. This young group went forth with faith, following the prophet. The Lamanite armies were gaining strength. They had taken many Nephite cities, and the Nephite armies did not have the ability to stop them. This was a very tenuous time for the Nephites' survival, but when Helaman's army came to join the battle and provide support to the armies of the Nephites, we read that the Nephite leader Antipus did "rejoice exceedingly."[xiv] Later we read that his armies were "about to fall into the hands of the Lamanites"[xv] and would have had it not been for the arrival of Helaman's army. These two thousand stripling warriors were key to the Nephites' winning many battles, retaking cities that had been previously lost, and protecting the faith and freedoms of the Nephites. Alma chapter 57 tells us that these young men "fought most desperately," "were firm and undaunted," "did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness," and that they did "put their trust in God continually."[xvi] Remarkably, through all of the battles, not one of these two thousand young men lost his life. They were all injured, but they were all preserved, as Helaman said, "to our great astonishment."[xvii]&nbsp;<br /><br />Imagine what Helaman must have felt as the group gathered together after their battles. Can you see him counting his "little sons" one by one and then being overcome with joy and gratitude as he realized that they were all still there? Every last stripling warrior had survived the battles. Truly remarkable! Helaman tells us that there were a thousand of their brethren, the Nephites, slain. When referencing the Lamanites who lost their lives in the battles, Helaman simply says, "Who were many."[xviii] In describing what had taken place, Helaman used the following words: "And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe."[xix]&nbsp;<br /><br />Miracles are wrought by faith. These young men were individually sustained and protected by the Almighty God, in battles against grown men who delighted in the shedding of blood, because of their exceeding faith in Him. Their faith in God supported them as they supported the Nephites. &nbsp;<br /><br />I know that God our Father loves and cares for each of us every bit as much as He loved and cared for the two thousand stripling warriors. He will support each of us every bit as much as He supported them if we will but have faith in Him. Life is not always easy. Living the standards of the gospel is not always easy, but we need to remember that, as spirit children of our Father in Heaven, each of us comes from a divine heritage and has eternal potential and divine destiny. Speaking of our destiny, President Uchtdorf has said: "No matter how many times you have slipped or fallen, rise up! Your destiny is a glorious one! Stand tall and walk in the light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ! You are stronger than you realize. You are more capable than you can imagine."[xx] &nbsp;<br /><br />Out of all that is written in the Book of Mormon about Helaman's two thousand little sons and their experiences, my favorite verse is Alma 53:19. When speaking of these young men, Helaman says, "And now behold, as they never had hitherto been a disadvantage to the Nephites, they became now at this period of time also a <em>great support</em>."[xxi]&nbsp;<br /><br />As these young men changed, or progressed, from not being a "disadvantage" to becoming a "great support," miracles happened. Their covenants and their faith sustained them through their trials as they were led to do an amazing and an important work. They were a great support to many.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, brothers and sisters, my question for all of us today is this: What can I do-what can each of us do-to undergo a similar change in our lives? Are we not a "disadvantage," or have we become a "great support"? &nbsp;<br /><br />The Lord needs you, the young people of the Church, to become a great support now and throughout your lives. Today's world is entirely different from what it was some 2,100 years ago. We may never be called upon to go to battle to defend our liberties, like the stripling warriors were, but we will face trials and tough times that will require more faith than perhaps ever before. We will need the support of each other and of our Father in Heaven, and we will need to become a great support for those around us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, I know that, like my grandmother and Helaman's two thousand stripling warriors, each of us has the potential to become a great support. I know that we can accomplish this as we follow the prophets, exercise faith, make and keep covenants, face our challenges, and remember our potential. I pray that we will go forth with faith doing those things that our Father in Heaven would have us do, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-devtional Discussion:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Several years ago, when I was about 26 years old, I was living in San Jose, California, and teaching high school. I loved my job, I loved my singles ward, I had great friends, and I was genuinely happy. But one day I was having one of those days where I felt lonely, discouraged, and a little sad. So I decided to go to an endowment session in the Oakland Temple.</p>
<p><img alt="Oakland Temple" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/OaklandTemple_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />I hopped in my car, turned on a CD of sacred music, and started my drive to the temple. The drive was about an hour and a half long. As I drove, I had time to think, to ponder, and to pray. At that point in my life, I was feeling a little discouraged by the fact that I hadn't yet had the opportunity to be married. I knew that being married and having a family were righteous desires. In fact, I knew they were an important part of the plan of salvation. And I was discouraged that my righteous desire hadn't been fulfilled. <br /><br />So, as I drove, I prayed and talked to my Father in Heaven about my concerns, my fears, and my hopes and dreams. As I pondered and drove, I wasn't really listening to the music, but suddenly my attention turned to the words of the song playing in my car. The words to the song came straight from a scripture in Proverbs: "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn1" title="">[i]</a></p>
<p>As I heard those words in the song, I knew they were a direct answer to my prayer. I felt a little like Joseph Smith when he said, "Never did any passage of&nbsp;scripture&nbsp;come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> I felt an overwhelming feeling of peace and understood that the Lord was telling me to trust Him, that He had a plan for me, that I would be happy and have joy in this life if I trusted in the Lord and His timing. I needed to allow the Lord to direct my path.<br /><br />This special and sacred experience continued as I attended the temple. The feeling of peace I felt in my car continued with me throughout the session. The endowment session was quite small, but after the session was over, three different sisters I didn't know came up to me individually in the dressing room or the temple lobby and said things like "I felt impressed that Heavenly Father wanted me to tell you how much He loves you" or "I know Heavenly Father is pleased that you are here in the temple today." As I left the temple, I knew with a certainty that Heavenly Father loved me and had a plan for my life. <br /><br />Since that day, I have tried to trust the Lord with all my heart. Keep in mind, the answer to my prayer wasn't for the Lord to change my situation. Thirteen years have passed, I'm now 39, and I still haven't had the opportunity to be married. Rather than changing my situation, the Lord changed my heart. As I have trusted in the Lord and his timing, He has given me immense peace and joy. I am truly happy and content. <br /><br />I'd like to talk today about that scripture in Proverbs 3:5-6 that is so meaningful to me because of my experience on the way to the temple that day. Let's take a few minutes to examine each phrase of the proverb.</p>
<p><strong>Trust in the Lord with All Your Heart</strong><strong><br /></strong>First, "trust in the Lord with all [your] heart." What does it mean to trust in the Lord? I believe that to truly trust in the Lord, two things are required: We must have faith in Him, and we must act on that faith by being obedient to the will of the Lord. Trust requires more than just belief. Trust requires action. <br /><br />According to Richard G. Scott, "To trust means to obey willingly without knowing the end from the beginning."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a> This principle is demonstrated by the widow woman who helped Elijah the prophet.</p>
<p><img alt="Widow" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Widow.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1 Kings 17 we read that Elijah was commanded to go to Zarephath and that, when he got there, he would find a widow woman who would sustain him. When Elijah arrived, he found the woman, as he had been promised. He asked her to bring him something to drink and something to eat. The woman replied, "As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a> Elijah replied by telling her not to fear. He told her to make a cake for him first, then to make something for herself and her son. Elijah then promised her, "For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruise of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a> Can you image the trust it took for this woman to give food to the prophet first and then to feed her son? <br /><br />Elder Ulisses Soares said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Mortal life is a period of testing [that] ... will require unwavering faith in Christ even in times of great difficulty. It will require that we press forward with steadfast faith in Christ, being led by the Spirit and trusting that God will provide for our needs."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn6" title="">[vi]</a></p>
<p>For each of us, the tests of life come in different forms. But struggles are a part of the Lord's plan. Some of us struggle with illness, with the death of a loved one, with depression or financial difficulties. Some of us struggle with infertility or with being single. Others of us struggle because of decisions made by others: Family members leave the Church, parents get divorced, and some spouses are unkind. Our struggles are varied and unique, but we all struggle with something. None of us have lives that are ideal, but through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can find true joy and peace even when our situation isn't ideal. <br /><br />Elder L. Whitney Clayton said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"God asks us to bear with Him--to trust Him and to follow Him. He pleads with us to 'dispute not because ye see not.' He cautions us that we shouldn't expect easy answers or quick fixes from heaven. Things work out when we stand firm during the 'trial of [our] faith,' however hard that test may be to endure or slow the answer may be in coming."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we read in Helaman, "Yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn8" title="">[viii]</a></p>
<p><a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn8" title=""></a><strong>Lean Not unto Thine Own Understanding</strong><strong><br /></strong>The second phrase in the proverb cautions us, "Lean not unto thine own understanding." <br /><br />There are some who might say that if we are trusting in the Lord and leaning not unto our own understanding, then we are just exhibiting blind obedience. But that is not what the Lord asks of us. Rather the Lord asks us to be as Ezra, who "prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[ix]</a> The Lord has commanded us to seek learning and to be teachable. Without help from heaven and the confirmation of the Holy Ghost, our own understanding is inadequate. Rather than leaning on our own understanding, the Lord asks us to seek to gain His understanding. <br /><br />We often talk at BYU-Idaho about learning by study and by faith. Sister Chieko Okazaki gave a talk in general conference regarding this principle. She explained that learning is like rowing a boat with two oars. One of the oars is "study," and the other oar is "faith."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">"What happens if you try to paddle a boat using only one oar? You go around and around in circles. If you paddle hard, you go fast. If you paddle slowly, you turn gently. But you still just go around in circles. It's the same with trying to make study replace faith or trying to exercise faith but without study. We can often find ourselves just going around in circles."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn10" title="">[x]</a></p>
<p>In order to increase our understanding, we need to row our boat with both oars. We need to combine careful study and devoted faith and trust in the Lord. As we do so, He will help us gain His understanding of gospel principles. <br /><br />I vividly remember being a student at Ricks College 20 years ago, in 1997, when our new Ricks College president David A. Bednar spoke at devotional for the first time. He had challenged all of the students to come prepared to devotional and to bring our scriptures as a sign of our preparation. I remember sitting at devotional in the Hart Building and holding up my scriptures during the very first devotional, where we began the tradition to show we are prepared and ready to be taught.</p>
<p><img alt="Students holding up scriptures in devotional" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Devotional_400x200.jpg" width="400" /></p>
<p>That is a tradition that has continued since that day and one that we participated in today. I often think of that phrase: "prepared and ready to be taught." It has become very meaningful to me personally. When I walk into church, I often ask myself, "Am I prepared and ready to be taught?" When I go to the temple, I strive to be prepared and ready to be taught. In order to gain the Lord's understanding, rather than leaning on our own, we need to be prepared and ready to be taught. And we need to seek answers from the scriptures and the words of the prophets.<br /><br />In a recent BYU-Idaho devotional, Sister Sheri Dew spoke of seeking answers to gospel questions. She said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As seekers of truth, our safety lies in asking the right questions, in faith and of the right sources--meaning those who only speak truth: such as the scriptures, prophets, and the Lord through the Holy Ghost....<br /><br />"Men and women of faith are expected to have faith. While the Lord will reveal many things to us, He has never told His covenant people everything about everything. We are admonished to 'doubt not, but be believing.'&nbsp;But 'doubting not' does not mean understanding everything."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn11" title="">[xi]</a></p>
<p>My study of mathematics has helped me be okay with not fully understanding everything about the gospel. I'd like to share an experience I had one day when I was a student at BYU-Hawaii. But it requires us to talk about a little bit of math. <br /><br />Let's start with an easy example. Here we see two piles of fruit: a pile of apples and a pile of oranges. <br /><img alt="Piles of Apples and Oranges " height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Fruit1_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br /> Notice that the two piles are the same size. We can see this because we can match them up. Because these piles of fruit only contain three pieces each, it's pretty easy to know that the two piles are the same size. <br /><br /> <img alt="Rows of apples and oranges" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Fruit2_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br /> Things get a little trickier when you have piles with infinitely many things in them. But the same principle applies: If you can match up the items from the two piles so that each object in one pile matches exactly with one object in the other pile and you don't have any objects left over in either pile, then the two piles are the same size. In math, we say the two piles (or sets) have the same cardinality.<br /><br /> <img alt="counting numbers and even numbers" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Numbers1_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br /> Now let's try it with these two piles: In the pile on the left we have all the counting numbers. The counting numbers are the numbers one, two, three, four, five, and so on. Although we only see the first five counting numbers in the picture, the dot-dot-dot is intended to show that this pile keeps going. Since the counting numbers never end, the pile is infinite.<br /><br />In the pile on the right we have all the even numbers. Even numbers are divisible by two: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on. Again, the dot-dot-dot shows us that this pile goes on forever. We won't ever run out of even numbers, so this pile is also infinite.<br /><br />Now, to our finite minds these piles should not be the same size. When we first look at the piles, it appears as though the pile of even numbers should have half as many items in it as the pile of counting numbers. Every even number is a counting number, but there are counting numbers that aren't even numbers. So, if we think about it from a finite perspective, the piles appear to be different sizes. But remember the piles are infinite. Let's try to match up the objects in the piles, like we did with the piles of fruit. <br /><img alt="counting numbers and even numbers matched up" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Numbers2_300x200.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>This diagram shows a way to match up the numbers so that every number has a partner. If you pick any number in the pile of counting numbers, any number at all, you just multiply it by two to figure out which number it matches to. And if you pick any number in the pile of even numbers, you just divide by two to figure out what number it matches to. So every number has a partner, and no numbers will be left over. Although our finite view of the situation told us the piles should be different sizes, the fact that we can match up the objects in the piles shows that the two piles are actually the same size. The two sets have the same cardinality.<br /><br />I remember the first day I learned this perplexing principle in a math class. My teacher said something along the lines of "Our human intuition can break down when we study things that are infinite. When infinity is involved, things can happen that are hard for our finite human minds to comprehend." In that class period, we learned several other examples that illustrated how our intuition breaks down when we study infinity. <br /><br />As a math student, I was fascinated by these principles and left class thinking about them. Later that day, in my religion class, my teacher shared a quote that referred to the Atonement as "infinite and eternal." <br /><br />At that moment, I started to understand that, as my math teacher said, when infinity is involved, things can happen that are hard for our human minds to comprehend. And the Atonement was infinite. How could the Savior have suffered for the sins, the pains, and the sorrows of everyone that would ever live? How could all that happen in such a short period of time? My human understanding was not adequate to understand that great, infinite, and eternal event. But I could trust the Lord, and He could help me gain His understanding. I could trust that the Atonement did happen, that the Savior did suffer for me, that He did feel my pains and my sorrows, that He knows firsthand how I feel when I go through a trial. Although my human understanding is still inadequate to understand the logistics and mechanics of how the Atonement occurred, as I have studied the Atonement, the Lord has helped me come to know that the Atonement is real, that it was "a great vicarious gift" given in my behalf and on "behalf of all [those] who would ever live upon the earth."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn12" title="">[xii]</a><a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn12" title=""></a><br /><br />My study of mathematics has taught me that my understanding is not always fully adequate. Sometimes I have to trust in the Lord and ask Him to share His understanding. However, as explained by Elder Clayton, we are not speaking of "blind obedience but of thoughtful confidence in the perfect love and the perfect timing of the Lord."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn13" title="">[xiii]</a><a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn13" title=""></a><br /><br /><strong>In All Thy Ways Acknowledge Him</strong><strong><br /></strong>Let's continue with the third principle in the proverb: "In all thy ways acknowledge Him." How do we acknowledge the Lord? <br /><br />In the devotional preparation discussion board, I asked you to respond to the question "How can we acknowledge the hand of the Lord in our lives?" I have been inspired by reading your responses.<s></s><br /><br />In her response, Sue wrote, "Before we are able to acknowledge the hand of the Lord in our lives, we must first recognize it." Shawna noted that in order to recognize the hand of the Lord, we have to "pay attention." She also explained that if you "start your day with prayer and ask for the Holy Ghost to be with you throughout the day, [the hand of the Lord] is more noticeable." <br /><br />Many of you shared how prayer and journal writing had helped you recognize and acknowledge the hand of the Lord. For example, Stephen wrote: "One of the best ways to [acknowledge the Lord] is through prayer. We can offer Him thanks for everything He has given us, regardless of whether those things seem significant or not. We can also acknowledge His hand by keeping a daily journal of everything we have been blessed with as well as all the good things we have received." <br /><br />Several posts acknowledged how the Lord has helped you in times of difficulty. For example, Ana wrote: "In my life, I can see God's hand helping me through many trials. He was always there to give me strength to overcome life's challenges. I know that He loves all of His children." <br /><br />Perhaps one of the most important ways we acknowledge the Lord is to publicly acknowledge that He lives. Jessica pointed out that "this is the [simplest] way to acknowledge God. Simple belief in His existence ... is a vital part of drawing near to Him."<br /><br />As I pondered on this question, my mind turned to the story of the 10 lepers that is found in Luke 17. Ten lepers came to the Savior to be healed. Yet, after the Savior healed them, only one of the lepers returned to thank the Lord. Sister Bonnie D. Parkin noted: "The leper's expression of gratitude was recognized by the Savior as an expression of his faith. As we pray and express gratitude to a loving but unseen Heavenly Father, we are also expressing our faith in Him. Gratitude is our sweet acknowledgment of the Lord's hand in our lives; it is an expression of our faith."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn14" title="">[xiv]</a><a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn14" title=""></a><br /><br />We can acknowledge the Lord by expressing our gratitude. We can express our gratitude to the Lord in prayer, as we share the gospel with others, and in the way we live our lives. But we must remember to take the time to thank the Lord for what He has given us.<br /><br />President Henry B. Eyring said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The challenge to remember has always been the hardest for those who are blessed abundantly. Those who are faithful to God are protected and prospered. That comes as the result of serving God and keeping His commandments. But with those blessings comes the temptation to forget their source. It is easy to begin to feel the blessings were granted not by a loving God on whom we depend but by our own powers."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn15" title="">[xv]</a></p>
<p>We acknowledge our trust in the Lord when we are obedient to Him. The proverb says to acknowledge Him in <em>all our ways</em>--in everything we do. This requires us to consistently live lives of faith and obedience. <br /><br />As I think of my life, I am truly grateful for all the Lord has given me. I want to acknowledge His hand in my life. I am especially grateful for the love He has shown me. <br /><br /> <strong>And He Shall Direct Thy Paths</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>And now we come to the great promise of the proverb. Fourth: "He shall direct thy paths." What a great promise! The Lord's path is "the path that leads to happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[xvi]</a> This is my desire: to follow His path. <br /><br />A few years ago I traveled to Italy. Our plane arrived in Rome in the early afternoon, but we had been traveling all night and were exhausted. But we knew if we had a nap, we would make our jet lag worse. So my friend and I decided to go exploring for the rest of the evening and then come back to the hotel and go to bed at the proper time.<br /><br />We left our hotel, hopped onto the metro, and went exploring. We explored several areas of the city, had a fabulous dinner, and visited St. Peter's Basilica at sunset. It was a great evening, and we were happy but exhausted when we got back on the metro to return to our hotel.<br /><br />When we got off the metro, we pulled out our map so we could reorient ourselves and walk the right direction back to the hotel. But nothing looked familiar. And we couldn't find any street names we were seeing on the street on our map. The name of the metro station was correct, but nothing else matched up with our map. By this point, it was dark, the neighborhood felt a little sketchy, we had been up for over 36 hours, and we were tired. <br /><br />We decided to walk in a circle around the metro station. We figured if we did that, we had to find a road name that matched our map somewhere, so we could figure out where we were. But after looking for 20 minutes or so and not being able to orient ourselves with our maps, we were getting worried. We hadn't found anyone we could ask for directions, and we were completely lost. So I prayed.<br /><br />After praying, we walked for another block, and, to our great joy, we saw two sister missionaries walking towards us! As we went up to them, we were so excited to find out they spoke English, were from Idaho and Utah, and would be able to help us. <br /><br />Before I finish our end of the story, let me tell you the story from the sister missionaries' point of view. They told us that they had been at appointments that evening, but as they rode the bus back toward their apartment, a man came up to them and started talking to them. He was making comments that were unkind and crude. When they got off the bus, he followed them. They tried to lose him by going into a convenience store, but when they came out, they found he had waited for them and was following them again. <br /><br />The sister missionaries didn't dare go back to their apartment, because this man was with them, and they didn't want him to know where they lived. They knew from his comments that he wasn't safe. They didn't know what to do. So they said a prayer. That's when they saw two tourists from Idaho coming up to them. <br /><br />After we approached the sister missionaries, the man following them left. We didn't see him again that night. We explained our predicament and showed the missionaries our map. They explained that the metro station had two exits. The exit we had used wasn't on our map, which is why we were so confused. The other exit (the one we had entered earlier in the day) was several blocks away. But their apartment was right next to our hotel, and we all happily agreed to walk back together. They showed us how to get to our hotel. We made sure the man didn't follow them home. <br /><br />I love this experience because the Lord literally directed our path. Quite literally. But it also shows figuratively three ways that the Lord directs our paths. <br /><br />The Lord will direct our path to help us avoid danger. He helped us avoid the danger of being lost at night in a foreign country. He helped the sister missionaries avoid the danger posed by the unwelcome attention of the man following them. The Lord can help us avoid physical dangers and spiritual dangers as He directs our paths.<br /><br />The Lord will direct our path so that we will be in the right place to help others. I'm not sure if the Lord directed our path to be in the right place to help the sister missionaries or if the Lord directed their path to be in the right place to help us. But either way you look at it, the Lord directed our path so we could be of service to someone else. <br /><br />The Lord also directs our paths as we try to find our way. We are all looking for the path to return home to our Heavenly Father. The Lord will direct our path as we make major life decisions. As I look back at my life path so far, I see so many ways the Lord has directed my path in order for me to be where I am today. I love my job here at BYU-Idaho. Because of promises in my patriarchal blessing, I know I am where the Lord wants to me to be. <br /><br />When I started college, I had no idea that this was where I would end up. But as I made decisions about where to go to school, what to major in, whether or not to go to graduate school, and later what job to accept after graduation, the Lord directed me and confirmed that my decisions were aligned with His plan for me. Looking back now, I see how each of those decisions helped prepare me for the work I am doing at BYU-Idaho. The Lord guided me to go where I needed to go in order to end up where He needed me to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so grateful for the experience I had on my way to the temple, where the Lord let me know He loved me and that He had a plan for me, if I would trust Him. <br /><br />As I have prepared this talk, I have thought a lot about what I hoped you would learn--and what I hoped you would do as a result of my talk. I hope, more than anything, that you know that the Lord loves you and that you can trust Him. I hope you will go home and ask Him to help increase your trust, that you will ask questions and seek answers that increase your faith and your obedience. I hope that you will look for ways the Lord influences your life on a daily basis and express your gratitude for His help. And I hope you seek to always follow His path. <br /><br />In the document "The Living Christ," it says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Jesus is the Living Christ, the immortal Son of God. He is the great King Immanuel, who stands today on the right hand of His Father. He is the light, the life, and the hope of the world. His way is the path that leads to happiness in this life and eternal life in world to come. God be thanked for the matchless gift of His divine son."<a href="/devotionals/danae-romrell#_edn17" title="">[xvii]</a></p>
<p>I add my testimony. I know the Lord lives. I know He Loves me. I know He has a plan for my life and will guide me if I trust in Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Pre-devotional Discussion:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I would like to begin by asking you to listen as I describe an item while you try to guess what it is.<br /><br /> This item comes in various sizes. It preserves and protects its contents 24/7. And although it's important and some people have one all to themselves, most of us share one. It is something that all of us have access to. We must use the contents inside of it regularly, for ourselves and our families, or the contents are of no value. The contents weren't added at the same time, and they come from various sources. <br /><br />I was describing a refrigerator. What were you thinking about? <br /><br />A refrigerator is something we take for granted and is considered a standard appliance in today's kitchens. It has changed lives over the last 200 years, because it keeps food from spoiling and allows us to have a variety of food in our diets. <br /><br />Let's try one more. <br /><br />This item is small, portable, and has a variety of uses, including storing important information, allowing us to connect to important people in our lives. It works more effectively when we know how to use it. Its creator wants everyone to have one and use it. It has changed lives in the last 40 years. <br /><br />Were you thinking of a mobile phone? <br /><br />Refrigerators and mobile devices are two innovations that we wouldn't want to be without. However, if we don't use them properly, they are of no value to us. Food that isn't eaten, even when stored in the refrigerator, will spoil eventually. A cell phone that isn't recharged is useless. <br /><br />My topic today isn't about refrigerators or cell phones; it's about something much more valuable. Let me describe it to you. <br /><br />This item comes in various sizes, and we generally prefer the smaller portable versions. It preserves and protects important information from various sources 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It keeps us connected. We need to use it regularly to gain the most value, and the more we use it, the more valuable it becomes to us. Its creator wants everyone to have one, and it has changed lives over the last 3,500 years. <br /><br />What were you thinking of? I was describing the scriptures, the printed word of God. <br /><br />Pictured here are an original 1611 King James Bible and an original 1830 Book of Mormon, along with a modern copy of the scriptures. <br /><br /> <img alt="Old and new scriptures" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Bible,-Book-of-Mormon,-Quad_300x200.jpg" width="300" />&nbsp;<br /><br />The historic scriptures you see in these images are from the collection of materials in the David O. McKay Library Special Collections. <br /><br />What is it that makes these books so important to us? While the 1611 King James Bible and the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon have a high monetary value because they are originals, they contain the same information as their modern counterparts. <br /><br />We have many options in size, language, and format to access the sacred message these books contain. I hope we don't take our easy access to the scriptures for granted. Just as they are today, the scriptures were an important part of people's lives in the past. <br /><br />Our scriptures began more than 3,500 years ago with the books of the law, written by Moses, and the words of the many other prophets who prophesied of the coming of the Savior in the Old Testament. The New Testament contains the record of the mortal ministry, birth, Atonement, and Resurrection of the Savior. The Book of Mormon provides us with the fulness of the gospel and a second witness of the Savior and His teachings. The Doctrine and Covenants contains revelations given to the prophets in this dispensation. The Pearl of Great Price includes additional scriptures as well as the Prophet Joseph Smith's history and testimony. Scriptures continue to be received up to this day, with the words of our modern prophets spoken in general conference and recorded in Church publications. <br /><br />Despite the length of time the scriptures have been accessible, there were many times in the past when the scriptures were missing from the lives of the people. <br /><br />In 2 Kings, in the Old Testament, we read the story of King Josiah, a righteous king who ruled about 620 b.c., during a time when Israel had become wicked. King Josiah sent his workers to make some repairs in the temple at Jerusalem. During the renovation, a copy of the Pentateuch was discovered. The Pentateuch contains the first five books of the Old Testament and is known as the "law of Moses." <br /><br />Apparently, these scriptures had been missing for a long time. The king had his scribe read the scriptures to him. When the king realized how wicked the people had become and how far they had strayed from God's word, he tore his clothes, which was a symbol of intense grief and mourning for loss. In this case, for the loss of the word of God. Without the scriptures in their lives, the people had changed and become wicked. <br /><br />Let's move forward about 20 years and contrast these scriptures with the brass plates Lehi sent his sons back to Jerusalem to retrieve. Copies of the scriptures were still scarce, and it seems that not even Lehi possessed the written scriptures. A copy, engraved on brass, was in the hands of Laban, one of the Jewish elders and a well-known and wealthy citizen of Jerusalem. While it's possible that copies of the scriptures might have been available on parchment, Lehi and his family needed scriptures that would withstand the rigors of sea travel, warfare, passage from one scribe to another, and be able to withstand primitive storage methods. The brass plates were the right choice. <br /><br />Nephi tells us that after receiving the brass plates, he thanked the Lord for making it possible to receive this marvelous record, and then his father Lehi searched the plates. This reinforces the idea that the people of that time didn't own personal copies of the scriptures. It's likely that a copy was available in the synagogue but probably not in every home. Lehi found the plates contained the book of the law, written by Moses, the same scriptures found by King Josiah's workmen. The brass plates also included a history of the Jews from the beginning down to King Zedekiah, who was the son of King Josiah. This means that Laban, or his scribes, had kept the record current, since Lehi and his family fled from Jerusalem during Zedekiah's first year as king. Lehi discovered that the plates also contained the genealogy of his ancestors. More importantly, the plates include the words of the prophets. <br /><br />Four hundred years later, in Zarahemla, King Benjamin reminds us of the importance of Lehi's obtaining the brass plates: "My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God. <br /><br />"For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates" (Mosiah 1:3-4). <br /><br />From the Book of Mormon we learn of another group who left Jerusalem about 11 years after Lehi. Mulek, the only surviving son of King Zedekiah, who fled Jerusalem at the time Nebuchadnezzar invaded and destroyed the city, led this group. King Zedekiah was captured by Nebuchadnezzar and taken to Babylon. Omni tells us that the language of the people of Mulek "had become corrupted; and they had brought no&nbsp;records&nbsp;with them; and they denied the being of their Creator" (Omni 1:17). <br /><br />We already know that copies of the scriptures were scarce in Jerusalem. Mulek and his followers left Jerusalem in a hurry, so it's possible they didn't take time to locate scriptures, there were none for them to take, they didn't have room, or they simply didn't understand the importance of the scriptures. We learn about what happened to Mulek's followers in the promised land from the Book of Mormon, and that happens when a group of people doesn't have the word of God to live by. <br /><br /> <img alt="Paris Bible" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Paris-Bible_300x200.jpg" width="300" />&nbsp;<br /><br />For thousands of years the only option for people to have access to God's word was through scriptures that had been copied by hand onto parchment or metal plates, or were memorized. <br /><br />This is a 13th-century manuscript Bible, with the text copied by hand in Latin and probably created in Paris around a.d. 1260. Great care was taken by the scribes to copy and create beautiful pages to contain the word of God. This Bible was compact and portable, a great deal easier for individuals to use than lengthy roles of parchment or heavy plates. <br /><br /> <img alt="King James Bible" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/King-James-Bible_300x200(0).jpg" width="300" />&nbsp;<br /><br />Mass production of printed Bibles was not possible until Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type, oil-based ink, and a working printing press in the 15th century. Within the next 150 years, most people were able to access a printed Bible. By the time the King James Bible was published in 1611, there were various other publications to choose from.&nbsp;<br /><img alt="Geneva Bible" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/Geneva-Bible_300x200.jpg" width="300" />&nbsp;<br /><br />The most popular English-language version of the Bible in the early 1600s was the Geneva Bible, published in Switzerland. The Geneva Bible was a study Bible: it included notes, maps of the Holy Land, plans of the temple in Jerusalem, alternate meanings, notes in the margins, verse numbers, and headers. They were easy to carry and relatively affordable. These study Bibles allowed people to read and learn for themselves; the scriptures allowed them to change their lives. <br /><br />The pilgrims brought their Geneva Bibles with them when they arrived in New England in 1620. For the next three centuries it would be a rare household that didn't have a Bible among its possessions. The Bible provided a guidepost for individuals and families seeking God's direction in their lives. &nbsp; <br /><br />In a letter to his eight-year-old son, Peter, in 1784, founding father and patriot John Jay declared, "The Bible is the best of all books, for it is the word of God and teaches us the way to be happy in this world and in the next. Continue therefore to read it and to regulate your life by its precepts." &nbsp; <br /><br />As individuals and families began packing their wagons and moving across North America in the 1800s, they were faced with choices about what to take. A typical family Bible weighed about two pounds. While that may not seem like much, think about the books in your backpack. Would you be tempted to reduce the weight by two pounds? &nbsp; <br /><br />Books for leisure reading were considered a luxury, but the Bible was a necessity. In addition to spiritual uplift and educational text for young readers, the family Bible was often used as the official family repository for recording births, deaths, and marriages. &nbsp; <br /><br />In 1843, the <em>Bloomington Iowa</em> <em>Herald</em> newspaper suggested to westbound travelers that "every man ought to carry with him a Bible and other religious books, as we hope not to degenerate into a state of barbarism." &nbsp; <br /><br />Why did Lehi's family, the pioneers, and thousands of other travelers throughout the world ensure they had the scriptures with them? <br /><br />It is because the scriptures contain the words of God, as given to the prophets. However, like a refrigerator or cell phone, if they are never used, they have no value. The purpose of the scriptures is to help us navigate this life and return to our Heavenly Father. <br /><br />In John 20:31 we read about the purpose of the scriptures: "These are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name." &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder M. Russell Ballard tells us: "It is a miracle that the Bible literally contains within its pages the converting, healing Spirit of Christ, which has turned men's hearts for centuries, leading them to pray, to choose right paths, and to search to find their Savior. <br /><br />"The Holy Bible is well named. It is holy because it teaches truth, holy because it warms us with its spirit, holy because it teaches us to know God and understand His dealings with men, and holy because it testifies throughout its pages of the Lord Jesus Christ" (M. Russell Ballard, "The Miracle of the Holy Bible," <em>Ensign, </em>May 2007). <br /><br />In the introduction to the Book of Mormon, we read about its purpose: "It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come" and that "Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world." <br /><br />Without access to the words of our prophets as contained in the scriptures and modern publications, we can lose our way, just as the people during the time of King Josiah who strayed from the commandments of the Lord. Nephi understood this and recorded his concerns: "I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise. &nbsp; <br /><br />"Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they should have the law. &nbsp; <br /><br />"And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of brass"<em> </em>(1 Nephi 4:14-16). <em>&nbsp;</em> <br /><br />The scriptures and the words of our prophets can change us. When we ponder and pray about what we are reading, we can receive a witness of the Holy Ghost to the truthfulness of what we've read and to what we should do next. Let's try to recognize the feeling we get in our heart when we read the words and pray for understanding. <br /><br />The Prophet Joseph Smith provides us with a wonderful example. He acted on the powerful feelings that came to him when he read James 1:5 in the New Testament. He recorded in his history how he felt and what he did about those feelings: "Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know.... <br /><br />"At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to 'ask of God,' concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture" (Joseph Smith--History 1:12-13).<em></em> <br /><br />What have you discovered in your scripture study that has made a difference in your life? Please take about one minute and turn to your neighbor and reverently share something from the scriptures that has changed you. <br /><br />If you haven't already, I hope you will take time to ponder how studying the scriptures has changed you. <br /><br />The scriptures provide us opportunities to change as we study the words and experiences of others. As we read, we can ask ourselves what promptings and feelings come to us as we ponder the verses. <br /><br /> <img alt="First edition Book of Mormon" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Summer%202017/Graphics/first-edition-Book-of-Mormon_300x200.jpg" width="300" />&nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to share one of my favorite stories from the Book of Mormon. It is the story of Alma and Amulek, as recorded in Alma 8-14, 34. These few chapters relate their amazing experiences in Ammonihah. My life has been different from Amulek's, yet when I read these scriptures, I recognize the change Amulek experienced, which was possible because Alma was willing to change his life and focus on preaching the gospel. I can feel the strength of the testimonies Alma and Amulek shared and the power of their faith. &nbsp; <br /><br />Amulek was a descendant of Lehi. He was a hardworking, rich, and well-known man in Ammonihah. He had done his family history research and knew he was a descendant of Lehi and Joseph of Egypt. He tells us that although he had opportunities to embrace the gospel, he turned away from them. Nevertheless, God knows all things, including what's in our hearts. God knew that Amulek would care for the prophet Alma. He sent an angel to Amulek to touch his heart that he would humble himself and help Alma. Amulek cared for him for some time. Alma taught and blessed Amulek and his large family. God commanded Alma to take Amulek with him to call the people of Ammonihah to repentance. He accompanied Alma as he preached, supporting and sustaining and befriending Alma; teaching gospel principles and testifying of the Savior and His Atonement; witnessing the horror of death by fire of righteous women and children, perhaps even the deaths of his own family; suffering in prison; exercising faith; and speaking out as a second witness to the things Alma prophesied. &nbsp; <br /><br />What I've learned from Amulek is that people's hearts change, but the principles of the gospel don't change. Amulek was willing to change his life. He accepted Alma as a prophet and willingly accompanied him to preach and prophesy to the people in Ammonihah. He gave up his wealth and prominence in the community to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ. He taught that faith can help us break down even the biggest barriers, the importance of making repentance part of our lives now, the value of praying over every part of our lives and our families, the Savior's Atonement, the Resurrection, and much more. &nbsp; <br /><br />Our beloved prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, testified to us of the power of the scriptures: "We live in a time of great trouble and wickedness. What will protect us from the sin and evil so prevalent in the world today? I maintain that a strong testimony of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and of His gospel will help see us through to safety. If you are not reading the Book of Mormon each day, please do so. If you will read it prayerfully and with a sincere desire to know the truth, the Holy Ghost will manifest its truth to you.... &nbsp; <br /><br />"... I implore each of us to prayerfully study and ponder the Book of Mormon each day. As we do so, we will be in a position to hear the voice of the Spirit, to resist temptation, to overcome doubt and fear, and to receive heaven's help in our lives" (Thomas S. Monson, "The Power of the Book of Mormon," <em>Ensign, </em>May 2017). &nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to make three suggestions for us to consider incorporating into our daily study of the Book of Mormon and the Bible:</p>
<p>In a 1993 address to CES religious educators, then Elder Henry B. Eyring, of the First Quorum of the Seventy, reminded us, "The effect of sincere prayer and of careful scripture study is to <em>always </em>feel an urging to <em>do </em>things<em>.</em>" <br /><br />It is my prayer that as we read and study the scriptures, we will recognize the promptings we receive, act on them, and allow ourselves to be changed by the scriptures. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pre-devotional discussion:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hello! I'd like to start my talk by outlining some of the experiences that led up to my devotional today. You see, I have a confession to make: I am extremely nervous about speaking in front of large groups. Uh-oh. So I've been here since 2009, and I've had a number of friends who've given devotionals over that time. However, most recently, I was part of the Student Services area on campus, and I began to notice that they started getting picked for devotionals--first Aaron Sanns, then Kyle Martin, then, last August, Tyler Williams. I saw the writing on the wall, so I moved over to Pathway. I thought I was out of the woods. Then when President Uchtdorf announced that BYU-Pathway would be moving to Salt Lake, well then, I knew I was totally in the clear. Spoke. Too. Soon.<br /><br /> But in all seriousness, I am delighted to speak with you today and hope that, despite my nervousness, I can, with the Lord's help, deliver a message today about the blessings of true conversion. <br /><br />I'd like to start with a poll, and I need your assistance. On your mobile device, go to slido.com and enter #BYUIdevo. That will bring you to some poll questions. Be candid in your responses, as I hope we can learn more about each other and ourselves through this process. <br /><br />Now, thinking of our answers, I want you to reflect on your conversion experience as this devotional progresses. If you are sincere in your reflection, I know that the Lord will provide you with further insight into the next steps He needs you to take along your conversion journey. <br /><br />The <em>True to the Faith</em> manual states that "conversion includes a change in behavior, but it goes beyond behavior; it is a change in our very nature. It is such a significant change that the Lord and His prophets refer to it as a rebirth, a change of heart, and a&nbsp;baptism&nbsp;of fire" (<em>True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference </em>[2004], 40-43). <br /><br />In an October 2012 general conference, Elder David A. Bednar stated that "conversion is an enlarging, a deepening, and a broadening of the undergirding base of testimony. It is the result of revelation from God, accompanied by individual repentance, obedience, and diligence" (David A. Bednar, "Converted unto the Lord," <em>Ensign, </em>Nov. 2012). <br /><br />He later quotes Alma 23:6-8: "As many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through the preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God working miracles in them--yea, ... as the Lord liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were converted unto the Lord, never did fall away. <br /><br />"For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more.... <br /><br />"Now, these are they who were converted unto the Lord." <br /><br />The Book of Mormon provides countless examples of believers who were truly converted unto the Lord: the Anti-Nephi-Lehis, Enos, Alma the Younger, and countless others. Their conversions and ours are brought forth through the power of the Savior's Atonement and through the influence of the&nbsp;Holy Ghost. That power brings forth blessings, and the three that I would like to focus on today are <em>a surety of hope, a boldness of action,</em> and <em>a legacy of faith.</em> <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><strong><em>A Surety of Hope</em> </strong><br /><br />In Ether 12:4 it states, "Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God." <br /><br />This surety of hope is what keeps me buoyed up when I may experience times of physical pain, mental anguish, or just temporal disappointment. I cleave to that surety of hope, and the Lord quickly brings my heart, mind, and countenance to a place of joy and peace. I long for others to be able to experience that same type of rescue, where the Lord's Spirit transforms and repositions us toward an eternal perspective. <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><strong><em>A Boldness of Action</em></strong> <br /><br />Now, as we think about a boldness of action, I'd like to share with you the following quote from the April 2009 general conference by President Henry B. Eyring: "You will need bravery and you will need boldness because you are enlisted in the Lord's army in the last dispensation. This is not a time of peace. That has been so since Satan arrayed his forces against our Heavenly Father's plan in the premortal existence. We don't know the details of the combat then. But we know one result. Satan and his followers were cast down into the earth. And since the creation of Adam and Eve, the conflict has continued. We have seen it intensify. And the scriptures suggest that the war will become more violent and the spiritual casualties on the Lord's side will mount" (Henry B. Eyring, "'Man Down!'" <em>Ensign, </em>May 2009). <br /><br />A true conversion will bring forth a spiritual fortification and confidence to move forward in faith regardless of the battles or turmoil we may face in this mortal existence. That conversion is dependent upon us submitting our will to that of the Father. When we do so, our actions can be bold, because we are acting not on our own volition but by the guidance and direction of the Spirit. <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><strong><em>A Legacy of Faith</em> </strong><br /><br />In the <em>Our Heritage</em> manual, it states: "Whether we are new members or old, we inherit a legacy of faith and sacrifice from those who have gone before us. We are also modern-day pioneers to our children and to those millions of our Heavenly Father's children who have yet to hear and accept the gospel of&nbsp;Jesus Christ. We make our contributions in different ways throughout the world by faithfully carrying out the work of the Lord" (<em>Our Heritage: A Brief History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em> [1996], 144-46). <br /><br />I have a personal story I'd like to share regarding my pioneer journey. My conversion story begins in late 2003. During that time, I was working full-time and finishing up graduate school in Indiana. Taking a break from studying, I was flipping through the channels late one night and happened to stop on Larry King. From what I could tell, it was part of an older, previous interview from the nineties, and not happening live. I watched for a few minutes, and while I didn't get to see the name of the guest, by what he said, and with the conviction he was saying it, I could just tell he was a man of integrity and someone who truly understood the importance of family. I moved on to another channel and didn't think much else of it, but was still impressed by the older, bespectacled man. <br /><br />Then in June of 2004, I was talking to some friends at work and heard about a guy who had won 15 straight games on Jeopardy. I was intrigued and tuned in, and for the next month, I watched him go on to win over 20 more before the Jeopardy off-season break. But what was most interesting is that each week I learned more and more about him in the "introduce yourself" segment of each show and came to realize that <em>this</em> was a quality guy: motivated, served a mission for his church, and loved his family. His name was Ken Jennings. <br /><br />Near the end of July, I interviewed for and was offered a position at a college in North Carolina. I began to prepare for the move, faxing in a contract for a local apartment, looking online to learn about the town--where the grocery stores were and things like that. <br /><br />Here's where I probably need to back up a bit and tell you a little about my faith background. I grew up in the Methodist church. Then when I moved to Indiana, I took a part-time job as a youth pastor at a Baptist church. I enjoyed both denominations, but when I stopped working as a youth pastor, I started attending a nondenominational church near the university I was attending. Faith in Christ was the most important thing to me, so I really had no preference of where to attend services. <br /><br />So as I was searching for things around the town where I would be working in North Carolina, I quickly realized the town of Hickory was <em>not</em> on a formalized grid. Streets changed names at intersections; some even had multiple endings like "36th Avenue Lane Drive Northeast." So even though I was finding things, it was still hard to know where they were exactly. <br /><br />I'm sure one of my general web searches was "Hickory churches," but, to this day, I still don't know exactly how, but somehow I ended up on the LDS.org website. I hadn't had any real experience with the LDS Church, only hearing about the Tabernacle Choir and that they had a Book of Mormon as additional scripture. As I browsed the website, I read about provident living, humanitarian efforts, basic beliefs, and liked what I read. I even tried the "Find a Meetinghouse" function to see if there was one in Hickory, but even when the address came back, because of the crazy Hickory streets, I had no idea where it was. <br /><br />I moved down to North Carolina the first week of August, got settled in my apartment, and decided to explore the area so I could see how far it was to work, to the nearest grocery store, the McDonalds--you know, the important things. As I was pulling out of my apartment complex, I looked up. And <em>right</em> across the street was the Church. I smiled and thought to myself, "Heh, how convenient. Guess I know where I can go this Sunday." I could just walk across the street! When I got back to my apartment after looking around, I got online and tried to read some more about the Church. I noticed the "Sunday best" dress and knew I could probably wear my suit. But I was a little stunned by what looked like a three-hour church meeting! I was used to one hour, maybe Sunday School afterwards, but three hours? I figured, "Well, at least I can try it this once." <br /><br />On Sunday, when I went across the street, I still had one main question. I wanted to know more about the Book of Mormon. The service was very similar to the Methodist service I grew up in, so I was relatively relaxed. A couple speakers got up and spoke about how much they enjoyed being members of the Church and how it had blessed their lives. A little later, another speaker got up, and I was waiting to hear about his experience with the Church, but he announced that his talk would be on the Book of Mormon. I was more than intrigued. Even then, I was not a believer in coincidence. So with me finding the website, the Church being across the street, and my main questions being about the Book of Mormon, when he said that, I just felt something was different. <br /><br />He answered a lot of questions, and I was starting to really feel comfortable. At the end of the first meeting, a nice gentleman on my pew helped show me where to go for Sunday School and then, after that, to a really neat "men's meeting." Of course I eventually realized it was really called elders quorum. At the end of the last meeting, the same man asked me if I was going to stay for the potluck lunch. I was like, "Free potluck lunch? Wow! Can this church get any better?" <br /><br />I fixed my plate and sat down at a table with a few couples that were around my parents' age. They were so friendly, and we started talking, and one of the first questions they asked me was, "So what ward are you from?" <br /><br />And I was like, "Uh, ward? Um, I moved here from Indiana." <br /><br />"Oh, so you're not from the stake?" <br /><br />"Um, the stake?" By this time I was really confused. <br /><br />Finally, the gentleman next to me said, "Oh, I'm sorry, we thought you were from the stake. Are you not a member?" And I replied that I was indeed not a member but that "this church seems really cool, and I think I might start coming." It was as if I had said some magic word, and they all started talking to me at the same time. It was funny, but they insisted that, as soon as I finished eating, I needed to go talk to the missionaries and ask them to teach me the lessons. So I finished my meal and practically ran over to where the missionaries were, next to the stage, and I asked if they could teach me the lessons. At first, the taller one paused, and I was afraid he might ask me that "stake" question too. But then I think he realized I was serious, and he pulled out a pocket calendar, and we set our first lesson for that Tuesday. <br /><br />They introduced themselves, and then I shared with them my experience. And they happily explained what a ward and stake were and explained that Sunday had been ward conference, and that was why we had a potluck lunch and had stake leaders there. They also explained that the gentleman that spoke about the Book of Mormon was the stake president. <br /><br />We eventually got into the first lesson, about the Restoration. Everything that they explained just made sense. It also seemed to fill in a lot of the missing pieces about my understanding of the gospel. They also talked some more about the Book of Mormon and gave me one to keep and read. They left that night, and after reading what they had asked me to, I had a strong urge to pray about things. And when I did, I just <em>knew</em> it was right. They came back on Thursday, taught another lesson, and I was so excited the entire time. Near the end, they quoted Moroni 10:3-5 and asked me if I would pray to know if what they said was true. And I was like, "I know it's true!" And they were like, "Great! Pray about it and tell us how you feel." That's when I had to explain that I <em>had</em> read <em>and</em> prayed asking those things and felt complete comfort and sureness. <br /><br />However, one of the most interesting experiences came in a later discussion, when the missionaries brought over some cups with labels of "apostle" and "prophet." They explained the structure of the Church, and as they did, they turned the cups around and explained who the current apostles and prophet were. When they got to the prophet, I froze. President Gordon B. Hinckley--I had seen him before. And <em>boom,</em> I remembered where: clips from Larry King from the year before! I explained it to the missionaries, and we <em>all</em> knew it was not coincidence. <br /><br />I wanted to be baptized, and I was, just a little over a month from when I walked across the street to the church. Over the next few weeks, I realized more and more that Heavenly Father was looking out for me and that I had been guided to the Church in an amazing way. The new season of Jeopardy started, and that same Ken Jennings guy was still winning, and that's when I realized, "Hey! He was a member of the Church too!" <br /><br />I have been blessed every step of the way. I did not know it at the time, but I even met my wife for the first time at my baptism. It might be interesting to hear her side of the story. Joanna ...</p>
<p><strong>SISTER RELKEN:<br /></strong>Good afternoon. It is fun for me to tell my side of things. So Nathan actually got baptized in my home ward. It was at the end of the summer, beginning of fall, so I had actually already gone up to college for the semester. Where I went to school was in the mountains of North Carolina, and it was about an hour and 15 minutes from my home ward, but that's still in the same stake; our stake spanned about a two-and-a-half-hour radius at the time. And so I was really excited when I heard from my friends all about this guy who had walked across the street, and that he had asked to be taught by the missionaries, and that he would be baptized. I just happened to be going home that weekend to visit my family. And since I had formerly been a ward missionary that summer, I thought, "You know, I haven't been released yet; I think it's my duty to go to this guy's baptism and show my support." Let's face it: when a single guy gets baptized, you go. It's true.</p>
<p>So I went to his baptism. And, actually, with the guy that I'd been dating at the time, he felt like he needed to join me to show his support as well. So we both went together. And during the baptism, I thought everything went well. He was baptized, and then there were some talks and the normal program. But then they stood up and said they would do things a little differently. Nathan had asked if he could stand up and say a few things. Well, this intrigued me. In all the baptisms that I've been to, the person being baptized had never asked to speak. So he stood up, and he just said that he felt like he needed to share some things he was feeling and about the amazing journey he'd been on. And while he was shaking all over, like a leaf--you could physically see him shaking--there was that surety in his voice, there was that boldness in his voice, and I knew, by listening to him, this is someone who recognized the truth and who was ready to live the truth. And I could tell that he had truly been changed; I could see that change of heart and feel it. And when that was happening, it's like the Spirit whispered to me, "This is what you've been looking for." And no, the Spirit wasn't telling me about him, the person, even though that would come later; it was telling me that that surety, that boldness--that's what I had been looking for, that while I knew the Church was true, I was still on my conversion journey. But I knew it was worth every effort to continue to where I could get to that point, where I could feel as sure as he did that day. <br /><br />What impressed me too is, while he was standing there and speaking (I could tell he was so nervous as he bore his testimony), I just thought, "This is someone who is powered by the truth and will be guided by the truth." And he didn't know what the future would hold. He didn't know, at the end of the baptism, a redheaded girl would beeline it to the front to eagerly shake his hand (he does not remember that). I know he didn't realize that, less than two years later, he would be proposing to that girl in Sam's Club--yes, I said Sam's Club; that's a story for another day--and that we would be sealed in the Columbia South Carolina Temple for time and all eternity, that our journey then just a few years later would lead us out to Rexburg, Idaho, where we would start our family. He didn't know any of those things. He didn't know the trials he would face. He didn't know the joys, the hardships, the sorrows. But he knew he'd found the truth, and that truth can guide him along his way. And that's what he needed. And that's what all of us need. <br /><br />And I would just like to end with my testimony before Nathan closes and just say that I and many in this room are all on our journey of conversion; we're continually learning day by day. And I have a testimony that it's worth every scripture read, every prayer said, every minute served. It's worth it. We're not alone in this journey; we have our Savior, Jesus Christ, who knows and loves each of us personally and will help us along the way. I testify of that in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /><strong>BROTHER RELKEN:</strong>&nbsp;<br />Thank you. I love you, Joanna. <br /><br />While my conversion is unique in circumstance, it is not unique in outcome. I have begun a new legacy of faith--a decision, a process, and a change in nature that will now be multiplied across generations. <br /><br />We all have this same opportunity, and we must seek to be truly converted unto the Lord; and in doing so, we will experience the power of true conversion, and we will receive countless blessings. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Associate Dean of Faculty Development</p>
<p>Susan Cox Ward was born in Puerto Rico, where her father was studying tropical diseases. Her family moved to New Jersey, and later to Alabama.&nbsp; <br /><br />During her sophomore year in high school, she saw an advertisement for Ricks College on the ward bulletin board, and decided that was where she was supposed to be. She earned an associate's degree in Chemistry from Ricks College and then went on to earn bachelor's and a doctorate degrees in Chemistry from BYU-Provo. She has taught organic chemistry on campus for over twenty years. &nbsp; <br /><br />Susan and her husband, Kirk, are the parents of four children.&nbsp; They enjoy outdoor activities including four-wheelers and motorbikes, floating on the nearby rivers, and hiking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am happy to be here with you today, and I pray that each of us will be receptive to the teachings of the Holy Ghost. My daughter Kaylee is 17 years old. She has taught me most of what I know about social media and cell phones. Kaylee has embraced the art of expression using emojis. I believe her favorite emojis show smiling faces--she uses these emojis on a regular basis to indicate that she is happy. In fact, when this kind of emoji does not appear at the end of a text, it conveys that, for some reason, she is not content. Some of my other favorites include the unamused face, face with rolling eyes, and face blowing a kiss. This last emoji, face blowing a kiss, I use frequently when I am texting my family members, to convey my love to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /> Emojis can be very powerful. They allow us to express what we are feeling, which is frequently difficult to do in writing, especially when writing only a few words. If you had to express how you are feeling lately, what emoji would you use? Would you give that some thought while I am speaking? At the end of my talk, I'm going to ask you to choose an emoji. I want you to give some thought to how you are feeling, because it is how we feel inside that I would like to talk with you about today. <br /><br />How we feel inside is important. How we feel guides our thoughts and actions. The scriptures teach us how our Heavenly Father would like us to feel inside: "Men are that they might have joy."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> <br /><br />There have been times in my life when I have felt joy. In fact, I can say that I spend most of my time feeling happy inside, and I hope that you do also. However, there have been times in my life when I recognized that joy was missing. In these times, I have pondered, "Why am I unable to feel joy?" <br /><br />As I have considered this question, I have realized that I can trace the source of my unhappiness to one of three areas: area number one, what I call the "mortal condition"; area number two, my own poor choices; and area number three, the poor choices of those close to me. I would like to say a few words about each of these areas. <br /><br />First, the mortal condition. Everyone who lives on earth will experience sorrow to some extent due to the conditions of our mortal existence. In mortality, people we love pass away. Many of us suffer because of ailments connected with our physical bodies: disease, mental illness, sickness, and disability. Most of the people born on earth are not born in ideal circumstances, and many people live daily amid great wickedness. We face financial challenges and challenges in our employment. Life really isn't easy and doesn't seem fair. Just as Isaiah described the Savior, if we live on this earth long enough, we too will be men and women "of sorrows, and acquainted with grief."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> <br /><br />Although it is natural to feel sadness because of the things that happen here in mortality, our Heavenly Father does not desire that we spend our entire lives sorrowful and grieving. At some point, we have to make a conscious decision about how we respond when these things happen to us and to those around us. <br /><br />Elder Russell M. Nelson has said, "My dear brothers and sisters, the joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />In order to feel joy, where should our focus be? That question is answered in Alma's tender words to his son Helaman: "Look to God and live."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> <br /><br />I would now like to show a short video from Elder Scott titled <a href="https://youtu.be/And0988vdC4">"How Can I Find Happiness?"</a><a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> <br /><br />When we focus on gospel principles, we realize that the mortal condition is but a small moment. Everything that is difficult because of our mortality will eventually be for our benefit and learning. In the eternities, there will be no death, no sickness, no pain to mortal bodies. All sorrow is swallowed up in the Atonement of Jesus Christ. <br /><br />As the psalmist recorded, "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> <br /><br />The second reason that I have found myself unable to feel joy is due to my own poor choices. I have learned by experience that "wickedness never was happiness"<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> and never will be. As much sorrow as I can feel about the mortal condition, I feel completely different inside when I make a poor choice. Yes, sadness is a part of it. But along with sadness comes guilt, anguish, pain--what the scriptures call an "unquenchable fire."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> This is by far the worst of my inner feelings. Because we all sin to some extent, we will all feel this kind of pain on occasion. <br /><br />Would you all open your scriptures to 2 Nephi 4:17-19? In a moment, I'm going to ask for a volunteer to read these scriptures to us. As we are finding these scriptures, I'll give you some background. As you know, Nephi was a great man. He also had troubles in life. At this point in the record, his father, Lehi, had recently died, and his brothers were once again angry with him. We are going to read part of the record that I have heard referred to as the "Ode of Nephi," where Nephi expresses some of his feelings: "Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities. <br /><br />"I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me. "<em>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins</em>; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> <br /><br />"And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins." Have you ever felt that way? I have actually felt that way, meaning that I wanted to be happy but just couldn't feel happiness because of my own poor choices. <br /><br />Our Heavenly Father knew before He sent us to earth that, at times, we would make poor choices. He loves us, and His plan provided us with guidance on how to conduct our lives and also provided a Savior for us. Jesus Christ performed the Atonement so that we can repent when we make poor choices, and be able to feel joy. <br /><br />Please, if there is in your life some poor choice which prevents you from feeling joy inside, repent. Literally, repentance can take a person from the depths of sorrow and self-loathing to feelings of great happiness. &nbsp; <br /><br />In Alma's words, "There could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> <br /><br />It is always better to make good choices, but when we fail, as we sometimes will, I can promise you that repentance is worth any amount of effort. <br /><br />For the past 50 years, I have been on a personal journey. This journey involves how I feel inside and is intimately tied to the gospel of Jesus Christ. At times, I have felt sorrow because of the things that happen connected to our mortal condition. I have also felt sorrow at times because of my own poor choices. Interestingly, what I have struggled with the most in the past few years is how I feel inside when those close to me make poor choices. In fact, in real life a person's choices not only affect themselves but all those around them. When others around us make good choices, they uplift all those around them. When others around us make poor choices, as is inevitable, those poor choices can affect us, and we must then choose how to respond to those poor choices. <br /><br />In my own personal journey, gratitude, forgiveness, patience, and a godly perspective are some of the traits that have enabled me to feel joy amid turmoil. Let me explain. <br /><br />Several years ago, I had a friend. My friend made a very poor choice, and unfortunately, because of our closeness, I was drawn into the situation. I felt angry, betrayed, and conflicted in my loyalties. I found myself literally consumed by the situation and consequently unable to feel joy. Disturbed by the way I was feeling inside, I prayed and turned to the scriptures. As I opened my scriptures one evening, I was drawn to a bookmark that I had been using for many years. This bookmark said the following: "Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> <br /><br />In that moment, I thought of all of the things that I was grateful for: the gospel in my life, a husband who loved me, two young boys and a beautiful baby girl, a home, and a great job. The act of feeling gratitude overwhelmed and pushed away the anger and other negative feelings. <br /><br />As I continued searching the scriptures, I was impressed that I needed to forgive my friend. I read, "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> In this case I said to Heavenly Father, "Really? My friend is not the least bit sorry for her poor choice." The answer was, "Yes, really." It took time, but I was able to forgive. Extending forgiveness was liberating for me. Gone were the feelings that were keeping me from feeling joy. I still felt some sadness occasionally for her sake because I knew how that choice would eventually affect how she felt inside. <br /><br />Would you please open your scriptures to Moses 7:28, 32. Perhaps one of the most tender passages of scripture is found in Moses when Enoch talks with God. After showing Enoch a vision of the city of Enoch that was to be taken into heaven, he was shown the residue of the inhabitants of the earth. Most of the inhabitants of the earth were not following God's commandments. Who would read those verses for us? <br /><br />"And it came to pass that the God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people, and <em>he wept</em>; and Enoch bore record of it, saying: How is it that the heavens weep, and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains? ... "The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> <br /><br />Even the God of heaven feels sadness because of the poor choices of His children. It is natural for us to feel the same way--we feel some sadness when we understand how poor choices will affect others. <br /><br />In the October 2015 general conference, Elder Lawrence of the Seventy encouraged the Saints to prayerfully ask, "What lack I yet?"<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> I felt impressed to follow his counsel, and what followed has made a lasting impression on how I feel inside. When I asked the question "What lack I yet?" I was clearly told two specific deficiencies: patience and a godly perspective. While I can't claim to be an expert on either topic, both have been crucial in helping me to respond to those things which tend to make me sad and limit the joy I can feel. Our Heavenly Father endowed us with agency, knowing that agency was a necessary part of our progression. He hopes that we will make good choices and feels pleased when we do. He also knew that, frequently, we would fall short and make poor choices. He allows that. He gives us space and time to experiment and learn. He waits patiently with open arms, always willing to support and help when we are ready and desirous to receive that help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a parent, I have learned that in order to feel joy in the midst of the poor choices of others, I need to follow the example of my Heavenly Father. I must, with patience, allow others to choose for themselves--not be paralyzed when they make poor choices, but love unconditionally and always stand ready to help and support as I am allowed to do so. Sometimes I have to be patient for a few hours, sometimes a few weeks, and sometimes the weeks turn into years. As poor choices result in situations that span years, there is a tendency to feel a degree of failure. This feeling of failure comes from a sadness that we were unable, after all of our efforts, to influence someone we love to "look to God and live." <br /><br />President Spencer W. Kimball wrote: "If we looked at mortality as the whole of existence, then ... failure ... would be calamity. But if we look upon life as an eternal thing stretching far into the premortal past and on into the eternal post-death future, then all happenings may be put in proper perspective."<a href="/devotionals/susan-ward#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> <br /><br />The worth of a soul is great in the eyes of God. I believe our Father in Heaven does not give up on any of His children--ever. And eternity is a very long time. Therefore, we walk hand in hand with heaven--we allow those we love their agency. We rejoice in good choices. When they make poor choices, we patiently wait until they feel ready to turn away from those poor choices, all the while being able to feel within ourselves joy along the path of mortality. <br /><br />Now, you have had a little bit of time to reflect on how you feel inside. Have you chosen an emoji that reflects your feelings? What I would like you to do now is to take a few seconds and text yourself that emoji. Go ahead, text yourself. I am going to do the same thing on my phone. If your emoji was a happy face, then great. If it was a different kind of face, perhaps it can serve as a reminder--a reminder to take some time to consider how you can act to feel happy and joyful. I'm going to be honest with you: I texted myself two emojis. One was a happy face, and one was a worried face. Most of the time, I feel happy. But just below the surface, ready to bubble up, are some worries, which have the potential to consume me and impact the joy that I feel. However, I am determined to not let those worries do that to me. <br /><br />I bear you my witness that our Heavenly Father loves us and wants us to be able to feel joy. Men are that they might have joy--not only in eternity but along the path of our mortality. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>After their miraculous and dramatic conversion experience, Alma and the sons of Mosiah wished to spend all their days and energy teaching the truths they had learned. The sons of Mosiah refused to inherit the kingdom from their father and pleaded with him to be allowed to preach. In Alma 17:13 we read that "they&nbsp;separated themselves and departed one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet again at the close of their&nbsp;harvest; for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken."<br /> <br />These courageous brethren traveled and struggled for the next 14 years. Each one fell into unique circumstances. Some, such as Ammon, had great success preaching. For others, we learn in Alma 20:30 that "as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen into the hands of a more hardened and a more&nbsp;stiffnecked people; therefore they would not hearken unto their words, and they had cast them out, and had smitten them, and had driven them from house to house, and from place to place, even until they had arrived in the land of Middoni; and there they were taken and cast into prison, and bound with&nbsp;strong&nbsp;cords, and kept in prison for many days." <br /><br />At the end of 14 years, these brethren met again with Alma on the road. Imagine what they would want to say to each other! In Alma 27:16 it is succinctly stated, "Behold, this was a joyful meeting." Perhaps this is a bit of an understatement. What do you think they had to say? What experiences would they have wanted to share? What would be the most profound and hard-earned lessons they would be eager to teach? <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, just like these early Christians, we are on our own epic journeys. We left our heavenly home most likely with great excitement and more than a little nervousness. For whatever reasons, best known to our heavenly parents, we have each followed a unique path. Some have been given the most difficult of worldly circumstances, both physically and spiritually. Others of us have been placed on paths of comfort and knowledge, perhaps on paths that are so dangerously comfortable that we take the most important lessons of life for granted. <br /><br />This is seeing our lives in the eternal perspective as journeys for growth, watched over by loving heavenly parents. It is a grand view which allows us to make sense of the confusion we otherwise face every time we try to find meaning in our lives. If we can keep this eternal view, then problems become challenges to be learned from rather than mountains of discouragement. Our brothers and sisters become fellow travelers rather than our competition or our enemies. If we see ourselves in this grand eternal view, then every chance meeting we have, such as this devotional today, is a time for excitement. This is "a joyful meeting," and I would like to spend it sharing with you, my brothers and sisters, my fellow travelers, some of what I have experienced. Much of it may not relate to your specific challenges, and, in the short time we have, much of it will seem brief or superficial; but I pray that, through the Holy Spirit, some of it will be valuable and help you on your personal voyage. <br /><br />If you grew up as I did, with that curious mix of skepticism and open-mindedness of the New Englander, not really accepting anything but ready to believe everything, what would be the most remarkable aspect of Latter-day Saint philosophy that would catch your attention? What is the most profoundly soul-expanding aspect of our doctrine you can imagine? For myself it was the concept that God is our Father, not in some superficial way used in prayers and songs but in the deepest sense of fatherhood, with all that it implies about us as children. As a child of God, as unimaginable as it seems, I can become, and He wants me to become, like Him one day. If we grasp this firmly, we will gain a self-awareness and understanding that will shape every word we speak and every action we take. We will live and serve as is fitting for our potential. What other perspective could possibly take us more certainly to our fullest achievements? If I am a child of God and you are a child of God, how will we act toward one another? Can we respect one another and allow for one another's imperfections? When I was a child, I would watch my father use a hammer. I could barely lift the hammer and certainly could not pound a nail in straight, but my father could do these things with ease. He did not ridicule my weakness but cultivated it, knowing one day I would be able to use the tools he had mastered. Will we one day feel the same about those spiritual powers which seem so impossible for us to exercise today? <br /><br />If I do not believe in God, what then? We learn in 1 Corinthians 12:4 that "there are diversities of&nbsp;gifts." If you have the gift of knowing or the gift of believing those who know, hang onto and treasure that gift; do not doubt it. But what if you do not have such a gift of knowing? How can you believe? As a philosophical type, I never was an atheist. If we emphatically state that there is no God or that there is nothing beyond what we can observe with solid experiment, we could be excluding a vast reality more magnificent than anything we have imagined. That has seemed to me to be too narrow-minded. Still, I was agnostic for many years, always skeptical of those who seemed to believe without questioning. Now I realize that questioning is the very essence of our faith. Questioning is what brought Joseph Smith to prayer. Questioning, coupled with some lonely life experiences, is what brought me to experiment with my first heartfelt out-loud prayer to a God I hoped would be there. I can honestly report that life has been a whirlwind ride ever since that day. This is expressed so beautifully in Alma 32:<strong>&nbsp;"</strong>Now, as I said concerning faith--that it was not a perfect knowledge--even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>"</strong>But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and&nbsp;exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than&nbsp;desire&nbsp;to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>"</strong>Now, we will compare the word unto a&nbsp;seed. Now, if ye give place, that a&nbsp;seed&nbsp;may be planted in your&nbsp;heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your&nbsp;unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to&nbsp;enlighten&nbsp;my&nbsp;understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me."<a href="/devotionals/andy-bradbury#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> <br /><br />Here is the great secret: faith is a choice. We choose what to believe, and from this we are also choosing how we will live. If you have a scientific mind, you might be saying, "Wait a minute, what about proof and reproducible experiments?" There are a few observations to make in this area. First, all truth should ultimately be consistent. When we have all knowledge, we will certainly find there is no contradiction between pure science and pure religion. Religion and science are complementary tools to get at what is truth. Next, if you criticize religion for its basis in faith, just what do you think science is founded upon? Science is, at its core, based upon a set of beliefs, postulates which we choose to have faith in. We run with those postulates so long as they continue to answer questions for us. Profoundly, we continue to keep our faith in those postulates even in the face of unknown and confusing discoveries. Truly, it is a limited mind that does not allow many unanswered questions to float in the background, waiting for new and expanding information. If you have some familiarity with modern physics, then you know that the most extraordinarily successful models we have--quantum theory, relativity theory, and the standard model of particle physics--have apparently irreconcilable differences, but we have faith that some broader view will one day explain both what we know and what we do not know. <br /><br />If faith is a choice, then what should we choose to believe? I know of no better path to happiness than that given in the thirteenth article of faith: "We&nbsp;believe in being&nbsp;honest, true,&nbsp;chaste,&nbsp;benevolent, virtuous, and in doing&nbsp;good&nbsp;to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul--We believe all things, we&nbsp;hope&nbsp;all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to&nbsp;endure&nbsp;all things. If there is anything&nbsp;virtuous,&nbsp;lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." This simple path of prayer and faith has proven itself over and over in my life, and I encourage you to see if it will do the same for you. <br /><br />Once we choose faith, we make a discovery: that miracles are real and happen all the time. We just need to look for them. Miracles can occur on a grand scale but are also happening daily in the most common of circumstances. We simply need "eyes to see" and "ears to hear," as proclaimed by both Moses and Ezekiel.<a href="/devotionals/andy-bradbury#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> Becky and I recently had a flat tire to teach us just this lesson. A flat tire after midnight over three hundred miles from home did not seem like a very good miracle, until we realized that only a few minutes before this happened, we had left the high-speed interstate highway and were now on a much safer road close to our destination. Also, just a week earlier, after first having a vehicle safety inspection, we had taken the same car full of young people over a dangerous high-mountain pass, where a flat tire would have been disastrous. Miracles occur every day, if we look for them. When we see the smallest miracle in our lives, it is proof that God is still there; we are not alone or forgotten. <br /><br />Now for some practical applications of all this. Suppose your life just doesn't seem to be going well. Suppose it is particularly painful for you to watch those around you who seem to have it all--success, happiness, and spirituality. Even the pictures in a Church magazine are hurtful, as they portray a family life much different from what you are experiencing or grew up with. Maybe your childhood and teenage years were stolen from you by life's circumstances or the actions of others. Maybe there are problems in front of you today that seem too large to face. What possible good are God, faith, and an eternal perspective for any of this? Where was God through all of this anyway? <br /><br />The grander view of our journey, from our entrance into this life, through all its challenges, and onward to our return to our heavenly home, is what brings sense to all this confusion and prevents us from getting discouraged by the difficulties of the moment. We see that we have fellow travelers. When frustrated with yourself and others, remember that you and they are doing hard things. We can be one another's best support. We need one another and can help one another. None of us should allow ourselves or those around us to feel isolated. This requires a large measure of love and forgiveness. We must stop judging ourselves and others. Surely none of us is perfect. I see our culture fail at this in at least two profound ways: First, we compare ourselves to an imaginary picture we build of those around us. These are frail people just as we are. Those who seem so successful and popular are at heart just as uncertain, lonely, and anxious as we are. We need to cut ourselves a break and allow ourselves to be human. Second, if we are to cut ourselves a break for being human, then we must also allow others to be human. Others make mistakes, do thoughtless things, and forget their promises. God is working in their lives just as He is working in ours. Let them be imperfect, and let them still be your brothers and sisters. We must not take this trip alone. When we judge others, we forget that our habit of passing judgment may actually be a greater fault than whatever little thing it is we perceive in another. What a wonderful thing that the Lord works with all of us no matter what our flaws may be. The Lord has given great advice for both these situations: About forgiving ourselves--Mosiah 4:27: "It is not requisite that a man should run&nbsp;faster than he has strength." About forgiving others--Matthew 7:3: "And&nbsp;why beholdest thou the&nbsp;mote&nbsp;that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the&nbsp;beam&nbsp;that is in thine own eye?" &nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps due to abuse, addictions, or family drama, we find we must separate ourselves from family members. By all means, do whatever is necessary to be safe and free from the drama which may try to imprison you and prevent your growth. This may even continue for years, but, if at all possible, try not to totally disown a parent, sibling, grandparent, or child. God is working in their lives as surely as He is working in yours. Leave the door open at least a faint crack in preserving some relationship so miracles may later become visible. <br /><br />It helps in these difficulties to realize that what we see and struggle with in this lifetime, in ourselves and in others, is just the packaging for our spirits. We are not the imperfect mind and body we inhabit. Depression and anxiety are not spiritual or character flaws any more than are diabetes and bad knees. These are all part of the package we received for this journey. Mind and body, with all the shortcomings we experience, are consequences of life in this imperfect world. This is a training ground, and the flaws are our challenges. One day we will see what each of us truly is, with healed mind and body, and we will be humbled to realize how we have misjudged one another. Some who seemed outwardly to be the most flawed will be revealed as the most pure. <br /><br />Even though we forgive others, care about others, and want to lift others, we do not need to be like them. If you come from a family of dysfunction and even abuse, it is particularly important to recognize the heroic role you are playing. You are looking back at all the generations before you and saying, "From this point forward, it will be different." This does not mean you will always do the right thing. A hero is not someone who always does the right thing, but a hero is someone who keeps getting up each time they are knocked down, and keeps trying. The role you are taking is to see that change occurs, starting now. We all have aspects of our family culture, sometimes quite subtle, that we can improve for the next generations. <br /><br />One of the most pervasive and nearly universal problems in our family cultures centers on shame. Starting in childhood, we all begin a lifelong career of making mistakes. We break things. We say the wrong thing. We forget things. We are unkind. We are careless. Every day we manage to do this. The healthy way to go through life is to recognize our mistakes and resolve to try to do better, and then try again. Every day and every moment is a new opportunity, a fresh start. However, we have a quiet internal dialogue (and often a loud, spoken dialogue) that undoes this healthy learning process. This is the message of shame that goes beyond "Oh rats, I messed up" to "I am a bad person. I always get things wrong. I'll never be any good. Can't I do anything right?" We feed these shaming messages to ourselves and others all the time. We likely heard some of this as children and will find it hard not to use these expressions with others. This is a sneaky tool of Satan's which is keeping us from recognizing that true royal heritage that we have as literal children of God. Watch for and break this cycle whenever you can. Be that hero that breaks the cycle of shaming across the generations. <br /><br />What about those mistakes we make that we can't fix? Sometimes we are so comfortable and successful in our lives that we think we can fix anything that happens. However, life has a way of shaking this out of us. Sooner or later we will make some mistake that we are helpless to fix. We make a bad choice. We do something dishonest. We hurt someone else. We break a commandment and don't see how we can ever undo the damage. What do we do to fix this? The truth is, after we have tried everything in our power, there are still some things that we cannot fix. However, this is not a time for shaming ourselves into thinking that we are horrible, evil, or bad to the core. Yes, we are human beings who make mistakes, but we are still of great worth. We are still royal children of God, and He has provided a miraculous way through the pain. This is the Atonement, perhaps the most mysterious and most wonderful part of all the wonders of our existence. Brothers and sisters, never give up. Never think there is no way out. Jesus Christ came to earth for exactly this reason: to provide a way out when we cannot find one ourselves. When things are going poorly, when we seem to have made mistakes that can never be undone, these are exactly the times for our greatest growth. These are times for a reset, for a new direction. These experiences give us the energy to change, and Jesus Christ's gift of repentance and the Atonement, one of those great unknowns we can scarcely imagine, makes the change possible. <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, thank you for sharing your journey with me. I have given just a glimpse of truths that mean so much to me, about a living God who is our Father, faith that there is much more to our existence than first meets the eye, the reality of miracles, our need for one another, finding forgiveness for ourselves and others, keeping family relationships whenever possible, the importance of moving the next generation a little closer to perfection, the battle we must fight against shame, and the gift of the Atonement. I am grateful for this life and for that internal instrument we have which resonates whenever a chord of truth is played. I am grateful for our Savior and for His gift of the Atonement, which allows us to have healing hope for the future. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>BYU-Idaho President</p>
<p>Henry Johnson Eyring became the 17th president of Brigham Young University-Idaho in April 2017.<br /><br />President Eyring and his family have had a long association with Rexburg and BYU-Idaho. He first came to the area as a child, when his father, President Henry B. Eyring, served as president of Ricks College. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />He returned to Rexburg and the relatively new BYU-Idaho in 2006. Over the ensuing 11 years at the university, he has served as Associate Academic Vice&nbsp;President over&nbsp;Online Learning, Advancement Vice President, and Academic Vice President. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Previous to his work at BYU-Idaho, President Eyring worked as a strategy consultant at Monitor Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and as MBA Director at BYU in Provo. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Eyring has served in various callings in the Church, including full-time missionary in the Japan&shy; &shy;Nagoya Mission, bishop, Mission President in the Tokyo&nbsp;Japan North&nbsp;Mission, and President of the Rexburg Idaho YSA 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Stake. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />President Eyring earned a bachelor's degree in Geology, a Master of Business Administration, and a Juris Doctorate from Brigham Young University. While attending BYU, he married his high school sweetheart, Kelly Ann Child. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Sister Eyring graduated from BYU with a bachelor's degree in English. She has served as a stake Young Women president, Primary president, and is currently serving as a Laurel adviser. President and Sister Eyring are the parents of five children. Their three oldest children are graduates of BYU-Idaho, and their younger two children still live at home.&nbsp;They also have three grandchildren.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're glad to be with you at devotional today.&nbsp; Our theme is natural leadership, the special form of leadership that President Henry B. Eyring has identified as the heritage of BYU-Idaho students and alumni.&nbsp; We appreciate the preparations many of you have made by participating on the devotional website. &nbsp;That will help us enjoy a richer learning experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no better place than BYU-Idaho to pursue a college education.&nbsp; As a BYU-Idaho student you can qualify for President Eyring's remarkable prophecy that, "The day will come that [your] capacity to influence people around you for good will have you singled out as one of the great leaders in whatever place you're in."<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-fall-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Eyring was able to make this prophecy because BYU-Idaho is unusually focused on its students, a rare quality highlighted in a recent Deseret News editorial. Everyone here is focused on your success as a student and a future "natural leader" in the Church and the world.&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That includes not only your professors and other academic mentors, but all university employees.&nbsp; In fact, your team of academic supporters also extends to your fellow students, your parents, and even your ward members.&nbsp; In addition, there are thousands of BYU-Idaho and Ricks College graduates around the world who have committed to support you. <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know from experience what wonderful things are possible at this great school.&nbsp; Our three oldest children are BYU-Idaho graduates.&nbsp; We can see in their lives the fulfillment of the leadership prophecy of their grandfather. <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we want to explore the things you can do to make the most of the marvelous opportunities here, as our children did.&nbsp; You should know that success will require your full, focused effort.&nbsp; Of course, we're ready to help you with valuable university resources.&nbsp; If you make the most of them, you're very likely to succeed.&nbsp; However, it's up to you to determine your destiny as a BYU-Idaho student.&nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the great, global team supporting you, college is hard and sometimes overwhelming, even at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; I'd like to invite Ashley Pereira to join me from Salt Lake City.&nbsp; Ashley is an online student this semester, studying Psychology. Ashley, can you tell us about your initial experiences at BYU-Idaho?&nbsp; What unexpected challenges did you face? <br /><br />Ashley: &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had recently returned from my mission and was going through the infamous post-mission phase. I felt lost, in my education and my social life, I was feeling homesick for my mission, I missed speaking Spanish and I especially&nbsp;missed the Mexican food.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those experiences must have been disappointing and even frightening.&nbsp; What did you do? <br /><br />Ashley: <br /><br />Luckily God knew me and my needs and so that semester to my surprise, I lived only a few apartments away from one of my mission companions. &nbsp;We were able to befriend and support one-another through that semester. Also, I was able to take a Latin Culture class that I loved with Brother Greg Palmer. He was kind and patient, and he taught me so much about Latin America. These two factors combined helped me to feel like I was still connected to my mission, while also moving forward&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Ashley. I'm so glad you had the courage to reach out to friends and professors. I wish that I'd sought help sooner when I was a student at BYU, in Provo.&nbsp; I worked my way through college as a dance instructor.&nbsp; I loved the work, and it supported Henry and me financially when we were newly married.&nbsp; But my grades suffered, particularly after I became pregnant with our first child, Emily.&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was busy with my graduate studies and didn't recognize Kelly's silent suffering.&nbsp; When she finally confided her distress, I immediately recommended that she seek help, as I had done when I got into academic trouble as a junior in high school.&nbsp; (That's a story for another time.)&nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry suggested that I meet with my professors and set an appointment for academic advising.&nbsp; I didn't know how to respond.&nbsp; Unlike him, I'd never had trouble in school.&nbsp; It had never occurred to me that there were people who could help me create an academic plan for graduating before the baby came.&nbsp; And I was afraid of talking with my professors.&nbsp; I assumed that they were busy and might not be sympathetic or helpful.&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally woke up to the need to help Kelly with cooking meals and cleaning our apartment.&nbsp; I also suggested that she quit her job and focus on graduating.&nbsp; That meant taking out student loans.&nbsp; But, after prayerful consideration, we decided that it was the right thing to do at that critical time. <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm very grateful for the help I received in finishing my college education.&nbsp; I discovered the university's academic advising and tutoring centers.&nbsp; And my professors proved more understanding and helpful than I expected.&nbsp; They didn't change my past grades, but they showed me how to study more effectively, and they built my self-confidence.&nbsp; I also received crucial counsel from an academic advisor, who pointed out an overlooked course required for graduation.&nbsp; I had to take sixteen credits in that final semester, while battling the nausea and fatigue of pregnancy.&nbsp; But our daughter Emily and I made it across the stage at graduation, one month before her birth. <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to ask Professor Kendall Grant to join me at the pulpit. Some of you know Brother Grant as a wonderful member of our English department. &nbsp;But I knew him as my talented classmate and star athlete at Rexburg's Lincoln Elementary and Madison Junior High School.&nbsp; I wasn't surprised to learn that he joined the faculty at Ricks College, where his father was a renowned athletic coach and administrator when we were kids.&nbsp; Brother Grant, how do you feel about Kelly's story of fearing to reach out to her professors for guidance and help? <br /><br />Kendall: I think many adults naturally resist asking for help. That inaction usually results in some lonely suffering. You know last night, my 4-year-old grandson came for supper and a family home evening of chopping and stacking wood. I cannot number how many questions he asked in that three hours. Interestingly enough, he got what he needed, most of what he wanted, and he brought a joy to the evening that we would not have experienced otherwise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it is the same for BYU-Idaho. When honest questions by students, administrators, faculty, and staff, lead to honest understanding and wisdom, powerful teaching and learning experiences occur and a joy ensues. In fact, it gives many the opportunity to keep baptismal covenants, to act like the Savior, to become like the Savior. &nbsp;<br /> <br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Kendall. You personify what was called The Spirit of Ricks when we were kids.&nbsp; Today we still enjoy that spirit of love and concern at BYU-Idaho, thanks to you and so many others, not only faculty members but all employees and many students <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to add a mother's testimony of the goodness of BYU-Idaho's team of professionals, particularly faculty members such as Brother Grant.&nbsp; While Henry and I were serving a mission with our family in Tokyo, we sent Emily, our oldest child, to BYU-Idaho, a place she nor I had ever seen.&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggested that Emily enroll in Brother Grant's freshman English course.&nbsp; He not only reached out to Emily in the classroom, but also invited her to dinner at his home. <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was surprised and deeply grateful to have a BYU-Idaho faculty member caring for my daughter when I couldn't be there for her.&nbsp; In fact, Brother Grant continued to minister to Emily after she finished his class in the fall of 2005.&nbsp; That proved true even after we moved from Tokyo to Rexburg, in 2006.&nbsp; When Emily married, several years after graduating from BYU-Idaho, Brother Grant brought a wedding gift to Henry's office:&nbsp; a handmade vase and two cups, both beautifully painted. <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kendall's ministry to students apparently never ends.&nbsp; Just this past May, Emily received a custom-crafted card from Kendall and his wife, Susan, who also teaches at the university.&nbsp; They wrote this: <br /><br />K:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[Reading the card]&nbsp; "Just a note to tell you that we are cheering for you!&nbsp; Every time I see a boat, I think of the water-skiing metaphor we talked about when you came to BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; There are many days when we seem to be dragged around the lake with our noses under water.&nbsp; It makes all of us smile on those days when we get up and can just enjoy the skiing.&nbsp; Thank you for helping me learn from that metaphor." <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Reading the card]&nbsp; "We love you!&nbsp; The longer we teach, the more we learn--the most important understanding we have gained from you and other students is a love for the Savior. Because we can see perfectly through Him, it is more than okay to be who we are right now.&nbsp; We are exactly who God wanted us to be so that we can learn and grow toward Him as we help each other in this imperfect world." <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As remarkable as this story is, Brother Grant was just one of many BYU-Idaho employees, Church leaders, and fellow students who reached out to Emily; the same was true of Henry Christian and Sarah, who followed Emily to BYU-Idaho. Many of those relationships remain strong even now, years after they graduated.&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tradition of special attention and help for BYU-Idaho students dates back to Ricks College days.&nbsp; Two of my brothers, Matthew and John, started their college education at Ricks.&nbsp; Both of them loved Ricks College.&nbsp; Matthew credits the wonderful people of this campus with providing the foundation for his success in life.&nbsp; In particular, our colleagues in the tutoring center helped Matthew with a calculus class that almost got the better of him.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><a href="https://players.brightcove.net/1146616447001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5565334306001">[Video clip of Matthew discussing help received]</a> <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm grateful for Matthew's courage to share that personal story. Now I'll invite Catherine Molina to join me. Catherine is an online student joining us from New York. Catherine, what have you learned about succeeding in college?&nbsp; Have you had experiences like Matthew's or mine? <br /><br />Catherine: Most definitely, I have learned that college success can come by having the wisdom to seek help as well as answering the call of those who seek our help.&nbsp; You also never know what more will come from helping another classmate.&nbsp; You may just end up making lasting friendships out of the most unexpected scenarios.&nbsp; <br /><br />For example: a few weeks ago, I graduated from an EKG course. &nbsp;On my last day, one of the students asked me if she could borrow my notes to help her study for her national certification. &nbsp;I was in a rush to head home but I also had a couple of questions of my own to ask my professor. &nbsp;I was really annoyed that she was taking up the time that I could have used to help myself. &nbsp;Anyway, I helped her, got the answers that I needed from my professor and the best part is that eventually I gained a friend. She was so grateful that she bought me lunch and offered to help take care of my son if I ever needed time to study. <br /><br />As I share this experience, a scripture comes to mind, "where much is given much is required" and "Are we not all beggars?"<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/are-we-not-all-beggars?lang=eng#note11"><sup>11</sup></a> Don't we all cry out for help...?". &nbsp; <br /><br />I noticed that just like we need to forgive others to retain a remission of our sins, we also need to teach others in order to retain what we've studied into our long-term memory.&nbsp; <br /><br />Through service and diligent studying and rehearsing with my peers in study groups, I've become the kind of student that I always wanted to be.&nbsp; I'm a 34 yr old single mom back at square one in college.&nbsp; Back in 2000, as a 17-year-old freshman at Ricks College, I found myself elated at the idea that I could hang out with friends who shared my same values.&nbsp; I grew up in NY where although I shared great memories with my classmates, I didn't get to participate in as many activities with them because they usually involved things that were contrary to our gospel values.&nbsp; Throughout my first two years here I served in the student body, was active in my student ward, and participated in service projects.&nbsp; I became so involved socially that I neglected my studies and my grades eventually suffered.&nbsp; I never figured out how to balance social life and school life.&nbsp; I was placed on academic probation twice and was eventually academically suspended.&nbsp; So, I figured that since I had always wanted to serve a mission that I might as well go then since I would no longer be in school.&nbsp; After returning home from my mission an unfortunate series of events led me down to inactivity in the church.&nbsp; Years passed by and I lucked out in landing a successful career in Arizona despite my lack of a college degree.&nbsp; I rubbed shoulders with coworkers with master's degrees but they didn't know that I didn't have a college degree at all.&nbsp; Due to a family emergency, I eventually needed to return home to NY and abandon all that I had obtained for myself out there.&nbsp; Unfortunately, without that college degree, I struggled to find employment to provide for my son and me.&nbsp; So, that's when I realized that I had to return to school to complete what I had started 16 years ago.&nbsp; However, due to my awful grades, I had to petition and beg to be granted admittance back into BYUI.&nbsp; I was obviously accepted back in but it wasn't easy.&nbsp; Only I know what I needed to prove and to provide in order to be given this gracious chance to be here.&nbsp; Because I need to graduate as quickly as possible I can't afford to work full-time which means that I am living with very small means and ten times less comfortable than I was when I lived in AZ.&nbsp; I can testify that The Lord will provide for our basic needs when we do our part.&nbsp; I can sympathize with the apostles when they were told to not take a second thought for how they would provide for themselves.&nbsp; Be faithful and The Lord will provide <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Catherine. You've done a great job of preparing for graduation and what comes next. <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm also impressed by Catherine's diligence in making the most of her BYU-Idaho education.&nbsp; She said one thing that I'd like to follow up on. &nbsp;She described preparing thoughtfully in anticipation of seeking help from professors, advisors and other mentors.&nbsp; By doing that, she increased her likelihood of passing The Doorway Test.&nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Doorway Test is this:&nbsp; When you appear, without notice, in the doorway or the e-mail queue of someone who might help you, especially a professor, are you prepared to be taught?&nbsp; That means several things.&nbsp; One is that you've done all you can for yourself.&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, your BYU-Idaho professors are here for you.&nbsp; They've chosen to work at this student-focused university because they love teaching and mentoring you.&nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even with BYU-Idaho's relatively small class sizes, each professor has a hundred or more students to serve.&nbsp; They spend most of their workday preparing for and leading classroom discussions, along with grading assignments and exams.&nbsp; That leaves only a few hours, at best, to meet with students one-on-one.&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given their limited time, your professors will appreciate your efforts to come well prepared to be helped.&nbsp; Those efforts will include knowing the course syllabus, starting assignments early, seeking help from classmates, and then coming quickly for guidance, before you fall too far behind.&nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't be surprised or disappointed if your professor refers you to a tutor.&nbsp; Establishing a relationship with fellow students in the university's tutoring centers can be a great blessing, as it was to our brother Matthew.&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working with a tutor does not mean that you won't have personal, one-on-one access to your professors.&nbsp; It just means that you'll be better prepared for those special conversations, in which you'll be able to discuss your challenges and goals at a higher level.&nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you approach your professor, it will also help if your motive is to learn, rather than receive leniency or get a grade changed.&nbsp; Your professor is likely to advise that you look forward, doing your very best from where you are now.&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That might even mean sacrificing the final grade you had hoped for.&nbsp; But what matters, in the long run, is your commitment to learning and meeting deadlines with your best efforts.&nbsp; If you consistently do those things, your grade point average at graduation won't stand in the way of long-term success. You'll be a dependable learner who works well with others.&nbsp; That's what employers and graduate school admissions directors are looking for.&nbsp; It's also what you'll need to lead in your home, the Church, and your community. <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that, as a BYU-Idaho student, you have the birthright of "natural leadership," for which you can qualify.&nbsp; Listen to what President Eyring said about you in his foundational address, "A Steady Upward Course," given shortly after the creation of BYU-Idaho: <br /><br /><a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/A+Light+to+the+World/0_nhnlzodk">["A Light to the World" video clip]</a></p>
<p><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world rewards natural leadership ability.&nbsp; What the world needs more than mere brilliant minds and standout scholars is selfless, sensitive learners who can help others learn with them.&nbsp; And here's an important tip, based on a proven truth:&nbsp; You can be a leader of your fellow students even when you're struggling yourself. <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether your confidence is currently high or low, reach out to fellow students in each of your courses, even if you're not assigned to do so by your professor.&nbsp; Ask if they'd be willing to be your study-buddy.&nbsp; That might mean as little as getting together for a few minutes after class or talking online to see if you understand the upcoming assignments. <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be times when you and your study-buddies need extra help from one another.&nbsp; You may decide to meet out of class to do some challenging homework together.&nbsp; Much of the time, you'll find that you're helping one another, rather than one of you seeking a lot more help than the others. <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not necessary to know everything or be a star student to help your classmates learn.&nbsp; In fact, you'll be most valuable to others if you teach and learn from one another at the same time.&nbsp; Sometimes you'll be the first to understand a particular concept, but sometimes you'll be glad that your partners saw something you couldn't.&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry if you find yourself regularly giving more help than you receive.&nbsp; And don't shy away from giving help that goes beyond schoolwork, even requiring you to bear testimony of your faith in the powers of Heaven and to provide other forms of spiritual ministration.&nbsp; When that happens, you'll get the benefit of being a natural leader, something of greater and more lasting value than stellar exam scores.&nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout your life, in activities that may have little to do with your college major, you'll remember and know how to apply principles of reasoning, communicating and collaborating that you learned in the process of working together with your classmates.&nbsp; You'll also know how to minister spiritually in situations that seem to be merely temporal, such as the workplace. <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowing down to help others in their studies may be challenging for those of you who are used to getting top grades and believe that success in life requires such stellar grades.&nbsp; But our children Emily, Henry Christian and Sarah are among many BYU-Idaho graduates who are glad that they made time and even took apparent academic risks to help their classmates. <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our dear friend Elder Robert D. Hales has told this story about being helped by one of his classmates at the Harvard Business School:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[video clip of Elder Hales BYU-I devotional "Zion Revisited" address)<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-fall-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> <br /><br />"I can remember years ago coming out of my first accounting class and feeling like I had just come out of a class where a foreign language had been spoken.&nbsp; I didn't have a clue what a debit or a credit was and what it meant in terms of cash flow and a balance sheet.&nbsp; I didn't know where to turn.&nbsp; One of my best friends at the university (not a member of the Church) was studying to be a certified public accountant, and he loved accounting.&nbsp; I can vividly remember sitting down on a hillside on a grassy knoll, opening our books, and having him tutor me in the language of accounting and its objectives and purposes, which I would take with me into the business world for the rest of my life.&nbsp; <br /><br />Harvey wasn't concerned or worried that I would get a higher grade or be able to pass rather than fail.&nbsp; He was helping a friend in need.&nbsp; You never forget such gestures of kindness and caring in life.&nbsp; It is more than an educational process to get a credit.&nbsp; This is how dear friends are bonded and a realization of why we are here in mortality."</p>
<p>K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to Elder Hales' friend, Harvey, you might take two New Testament characters as your guide.&nbsp; One is Mary, the Savior's dear friend.&nbsp; While her sister Martha was earning great grades for the practical aspects of hosting, Mary attended directly to the things that the Savior had to say. She excelled in listening and lifting. <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another instructive character is the Good Samaritan. He was traveling a dangerous road called the Way of Blood, on which knowledgeable travelers rarely risked stopping.&nbsp; Yet the Good Samaritan didn't just brave the risk of personal harm.&nbsp; He also paid for the care of the wounded man.&nbsp; And he delayed his travel, probably sacrificing business he was on his way to conduct.&nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Good Samaritan understood the Savior's teaching, "Whosever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-fall-2017#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a>&nbsp; I'm proud of Catherine and Ashley for being good Samaritans. <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I'd had that attitude toward learning and serving when I was a college student.&nbsp; I'd have gained a better education by focusing more on my classmates and less on my grades and on keeping my scholarship.&nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a better way to measure our individual and collective success at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; It comes from the family motto of Church President Ezra Taft Benson.&nbsp; President Benson challenged his posterity to see that there were no empty chairs around their family table.&nbsp; He meant that each family member should be vitally concerned for the spiritual welfare of all others.&nbsp; That's also the way that Brigham Young instructed the pioneers to cross the plains - by caring for one another along the way.<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-fall-2017#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course we need to come to class with our homework done, ready to contribute to that day's discussion.&nbsp; But the real measure of success is coming well-enough prepared to help our spiritual sisters and brothers learn, and to notice who is struggling or isn't there at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is what natural leaders do.&nbsp; They are good shepherds.&nbsp; And, in caring for others, they learn more than they could alone.&nbsp; Heaven multiplies their talents.&nbsp; <br /><br />H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world also recognizes and rewards them for their natural leadership.&nbsp; They "become legendary for their capacity to build people and add value wherever they serve."<a href="/devotionals/president-and-sister-eyring-fall-2017#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a> &nbsp;That is the birthright of the students, alumni and employees of BYU-Idaho, if we live to be worthy of it.&nbsp; Let's do so.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

He was on the faculty at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University from 1962 to 1971.<br /><br />He holds a B.S. degree in physics from the University of Utah and master of business administration and doctor of business administration degrees from Harvard University.<br /><br />Born in Princeton, New Jersey, on May 31, 1933, he has served the Church as a regional representative, a member of the general Sunday School board, and a bishop.<br /><br />President Eyring is married to the former Kathleen Johnson, and they are the parents of four sons and two daughters.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>These exercises are designed to mark the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Brigham Young University-Idaho. Today, on behalf of the board of trustees and the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I install you, Henry Johnson Eyring, as president of Brigham Young University-Idaho and confer upon you the authority, the rights, the responsibilities, and the challenges associated with this office. <br /><br />As is the custom, I deliver to you, President Eyring, a formal charge to guide your service. &nbsp; <br /><br />First, you are to place the Lord Jesus Christ, whose school this is, at the heart of your service. His purposes are to be yours, as nearly as you can discern them; His light, the beacon to guide your feet; and His love, your source of courage, confidence, and motivation.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Second, you are to serve and guide all who teach, lead, learn, and labor here by acknowledging and treating them as children of a loving Heavenly Father, with the divine potential to become like Him. He loves and values each equally. He admitted each into His school of mortality with hope that he or she will discover divine capacity and the pathway to becoming His rightful heir. Your charge is to help as many of them as you can walk that challenging journey back home. &nbsp; <br /><br />Third, your charge is to find ways to infuse the Spirit of God into the experiences of all who learn and serve in this university. That Spirit will be a key to their success in the strenuous effort they must make to learn and so rise to their potential. President Brigham Young gave a charge to Karl G. Maeser that is also a promise: "You ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God."<sup><a href="/speeches/president-henry-b-eyring-inaugural-charge-fall-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The promise is that it can be done. &nbsp; <br /><br />Fourth, you are to take full advantage of the Lord's promise that He will direct the path of His faithful servants. You must study and pray to know what you are to do. You must counsel with others and study whatever facts you can gather. When you then pray and ask in faith, you may expect to receive inspiration. When the path you feel inspired to pursue would in any way diverge from that which has been previously approved by the board of trustees, you are to prepare and present a recommendation to that board. Your purpose will be not to win agreement but to welcome confirmation and correction equally. The board, with a prophet at its head, will point the way to safety.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Fifth, you are to demonstrate and teach gratitude for those who have preceded you in the Lord's work of building this university from its humble beginnings toward its divine destiny. They each gave enough and sacrificed enough to qualify for His pouring out blessings upon this school, both spiritual and temporal<a></a><sup><a href="/speeches/president-henry-b-eyring-inaugural-charge-fall-2017#_msocom_1" id="_anchor_1" name="_msoanchor_1">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;--blessings beyond what they could foresee. The Lord did not make growth easy for them, nor will He for you. He did not make destiny clear for them, but He revealed the next step as He inspired the taking of it. He went before their faces, and He will go before yours. Your charge is to preserve and increase gratitude to the Lord for this university and those who have served Him here. &nbsp; <br /><br />Finally, you are charged to exemplify in your life and family the gospel ideals of Christlike love and perfect fidelity. You are to treat your family members as your most precious treasure. You will, by placing them above all earthly achievements, inspire for good all who are blessed to come within the power of your example and influence.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />We will now be pleased to hear a response from President Henry J. Eyring.<br /><br /></p>

<p>First Counselor in the First Presidency</p>
<p>President Henry B. Eyring was named First Counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on February 3, 2008. Previously, he had served as Second Counselor in the First Presidency to President Gordon B. Hinckley since October 6, 2007.

<p></p>
<p>Elder Oaks, members of the Board of Trustees, Commissioner Clark, past presidents of this educational institution, members of the faculty and staff, distinguished guests, brothers and sisters, and President Henry J. Eyring: It is an honor to be here with you today.<br /><br />I mentioned Henry's name last because I knew he would prefer it. He inherited that desire from his grandfather, Professor Henry Eyring, who routinely put his name last on the list of authors of the hundreds of scientific articles to which he contributed. He put above his own the name of every colleague, every graduate student, and once a struggling college physics student who happened to be his son. &nbsp; <br /><br />President Henry J. Eyring knows what his grandfather knew: great joy comes from building confidence in others and seeing growth in their ability to think and to do. It only takes a few teachers with this understanding to transform a little school into a great university. And those they lift go out in an exponential process of transforming others to build institutions across the world.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I saw that once when I was asked to lecture at a great university in Korea. I expected only a few people would come to hear me. To my surprise, the great lecture hall was packed with professors and students.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I asked my host why there was such a crowd. He said quietly, "These are the students of your father's young colleague, who became a great professor in Korea. These are his students, and their students, and their students' students. They came in gratitude. I think some of them saw your name and came because they thought you were him."&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />President Henry Johnson Eyring's grandfather passed on to him, and to me, a sense of how great universities are built. They are communities of people with an insatiable thirst to know what is true and what is good. They work so hard that their ears ring. They miss meals, and they get up at night to write down ideas that came in their dreams.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />But it takes more than hard work and personal achievement to satisfy them. Those real builders of universities cannot fully enjoy their accomplishment until they help someone else learn as they have learned. We know that from our own experience. Like you, I have marveled that a master in some field would take time to help me understand what he had learned and how he did it. He gave me confidence and created in me the desire to, in turn, teach someone else. Those builders of great universities draw others around them as colleagues. They find joy in giving others confidence that they can do more than they thought that they could.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Those of us who have taught, learned, served, and led in this school have seen that miracle many times. It is more frequent here because of the faith of the people who have gathered into this school. They share a faith that every child of Heavenly Father is potentially perfectible. And they believe that joy comes from helping someone move toward that perfection. You have seen this happen in the variety of experiences that make up the curriculum of a student here.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I have felt it myself in the Tetons with two professors of geology, in the classroom with my co-teacher in a religion class, and in the students coming to the home of my neighbor, a professor of biology, where, in the evenings, he tutored and encouraged them to believe they could become physicians.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />A great college and university are communities of such people. There is a spirit of optimism that comes from an assurance that every person has remarkable potential to learn and to become better. There is an intense determination to learn what is true and good. And the people in that community find more joy in helping others learn than in getting something for themselves.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Those feelings exist in people in many colleges and universities. But here at BYU-Idaho, it is realistic to expect that those feelings will be more intense, more widespread, and more enduring. Here we take the Savior as our model and mentor in all our service. &nbsp; <br /><br />Just as I have given President Eyring his charge as the president of this university, the Lord has given all of us a charge, accompanied by a promise. It seems to apply particularly in this special university community:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;<br /><br />Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms-- &nbsp; <br /><br />That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you. (D&amp;C 88:78-80)</p>
<p>Such a charge and so great a promise tells us something of the destiny of this university. In those three verses, the Lord paints a marvelous picture of what will happen in His school as we qualify with our faith and work for His grace. And we have the advantage of knowing the Lord's purpose. It is that we will be instructed and prepared in all things to magnify every opportunity God will grant us. &nbsp; <br /><br />With this scriptural charge in mind, I think I understand better the charge I received at my inauguration as president of Ricks College. On that day, after <em>my</em> father gave an address, President Marion G. Romney of the First Presidency praised the accomplishments of the faculty and staff in lifting the students to meet the standard of secular learning the Lord has set for us. Then he added what I felt was a prophetic declaration about the destiny of this school:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Her accomplishments in these secular fields, which concern worldly things, do not . . .&nbsp; fulfill her destiny. Her destiny lies in spiritual things, with respect to which there is a different measure of achievement.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>I learned from President Romney that the spiritual dimension of our destiny would be measured in the lives of the teachers, the students, and all who serve here. He referred to these words from the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Blessed are the poor who are pure in heart, whose hearts are broken, and whose spirits are contrite, for they shall see the kingdom of God coming in power and great glory unto their deliverance; for the fatness of the earth shall be theirs. &nbsp; <br /><br />For behold, the Lord shall come, and his recompense shall be with him, and he shall reward every man, and the poor shall rejoice. (D&amp;C 56:18-19)</p>
<p>President Romney then quoted another revelation describing the time when the Lord will make that accreditation visit to His university here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When I shall come in my glory, ... they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived--verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day. &nbsp; <br /><br />And the earth shall be given unto them for an inheritance; and they shall multiply and wax strong, and their children shall grow up without sin unto salvation. &nbsp; <br /><br />For the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king and their lawgiver. (D&amp;C 45:56-59)</p>
<p>I pondered President Romney's charge when it was given. I knew that every school in the Church had been charged with teaching both secular and spiritual truth. Why, then, would the Lord want the spiritual dimension to be preeminent here?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I came to believe that the Lord knew what this school would someday become. He knew there was a spirit in that little college, and He wanted that spirit to be preserved as He lifted it to become a great university. In those days, the students and faculty spoke often of the "Spirit of Ricks."&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />The spirit was not in the buildings or the campus, though you could feel it there. Rather, it was in the hearts of a community of people who thought of themselves as poor by worldly measures--who were pure in heart, had hearts that were broken, and whose spirits were contrite. It was a place where people lifted up each other's hands when they hung down because they had received the truth of the Savior's gospel and had taken the Spirit as their guide.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I now see more clearly what President Romney meant as he gave assurance that if we work to preserve it, the spirit for which this school has always been known would continue and flourish. As we become a great university community, the Lord would have us retain that same spirit and magnify it in the hearts of those who gather here.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />That spirit will continue to draw people here as it has in the past. You will not have to recruit faculty or advertise for students if you continue to build and nurture the spirit of BYU-Idaho. If you build it, they will come. And they will come because in their hearts they want to be part of this community. &nbsp; <br /><br />And then, in some future day, when the Lord comes, you will receive His thanks. You will come to know that He has been smiling on the little things you have done so faithfully to prepare this university community for that great day.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I testify that Jesus Christ lives. He guides and blesses all who lead, study, teach, and serve Him here. The Holy Ghost has lifted and comforted us today and will in the days ahead. Our Heavenly Father has heard our prayers and has sent the Holy Ghost to give us courage to move forward and upward as the Lord builds this university in our hearts. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>President and Sister Eyring, on behalf of the student body, I am honored to welcome you as the 17th President of Brigham Young University-Idaho. This university has been blessed to have had you as a part of the administration for the past 11 years. <br /><br />We understand that you have been prepared for many years to become the president of BYU-Idaho. This preparation has taken place in your home as a young boy; in school, as a student and fellow disciple-leader; as a priesthood holder fulfilling your duties and responsibilities; and as a son of our Heavenly Father, obeying His commandments and becoming the man you are today. <br /><br />As the patriarch of this university, we trust in your capacity to guide us and this university that we may fulfill prophecy and become like our Savior Jesus Christ. <br /><br />The prophet Lehi was trusted to bring his family into the promised land and out of Jerusalem during tumultuous and sinful times. Similarly today, the Lord has trusted you to guide us during our time as students at BYU-Idaho. <br /><br />We are excited for the future and the possibilities it will bring. We understand that these possibilities may bring about challenges and trials. We also understand that it is through these challenges and trials that faith is built and testimonies are established as we follow prophets and are guided by the Spirit. <br /><br />We are grateful for you and your prayers on our behalf. We feel your love and the goodness of your heart. President Eyring, we love you and support you, your wife, and your family. We anticipate your impact will be felt for many generations to come. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Alumni Association Represetitive and Student Life Vice President</p>
<p>Bio not available.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>On behalf of the Alumni Association, it is my privilege to welcome you, Henry Johnson Eyring, as our 17th president. When you served as our advancement vice president from 2008 to 2015, your leadership blessed us. Now, as BYU-Idaho's president, you have an alumni membership, exceeding 200,000, which enthusiastically supports you!<br /><br />Our first principal, Jacob Spori, said, "The seeds we're planting today will grow and become mighty oaks and their branches will run all over the earth." As Student Life vice president, I see the strength of our alumni across the world standing firm and steadfast in their testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. I commend their leadership in homes, communities, and the Church. Your father, our beloved Apostle and the first vice-chairman of the Board of Trustees, President Henry B. Eyring, prophesied that [BYU-Idaho students] "will become legendary for their capacity to build ... people ... and add value wherever they serve."<a href="/speeches/amy-labaugh-inaugural-welcome-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> Assuredly, this wonderful pronouncement is happening, and with great humility, we recognize the source from which these blessings flow. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We thank you and Sister Eyring for leading exemplary lives worthy of emulation. We appreciate having your three oldest children, Emily, Henry Christian, and Sarah, among our ranks. We feel your love for BYU-Idaho, your dedication to the Spirit of Ricks, and, most importantly, your devotion to the Savior. Upon this defining and consecrated characteristic lies all of our hope, confidence, and joy. May the Lord bless you in this great endeavor. You have our support and love. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Faculty Association Represetitive and History, Geograpy &amp; Political Science Faculty Member</p>
<p>Bio not available.<br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>President and Sister Eyring, it is my great honor to represent the faculty in officially welcoming you to this remarkable institution. Any such welcome is, of course, a bit unnecessary, since you've enjoyed a long relationship with this campus and its faculty. Over those years, you have no doubt sensed, as I have, that this faculty is deeply committed to perpetuating two of our university's foundational principles--two seemingly paradoxical virtues that have been articulated and nurtured from Jacob Spori, to your own father, to you. On the one hand, this institution is imbued with a spirit of humble frugality, a virtue instilled through its hardscrabble origins. On the other hand, that humble frugality has always been combined with a rather audacious reach--an astonishing effort to embrace all the pure knowledge that mortal minds can comprehend, a breathtaking ambition to overrun the earth with truth and light, grace and goodness. As a faculty, we know you feel the awesome responsibility of extending that audacious reach. We also hope you sense that we are your genuine friends and eager colleagues in that effort--ready to roll up our sleeves and work alongside you, in all humility and frugality, to stretch the boundaries of possibility. Most, if not all, of us were drawn to this place for precisely this reason. We were drawn here because this is a community--in all the best senses of that word--where genuine learning is the focus rather than worldly ambition; a community where scholarly inquiry can be pursued, by both students and professors, simply for the love of truth rather than for professional advancement; a community similar to one described in the Book of Mormon, where "the teacher [is not] any better than the learner"<a href="/speeches/david-pulsipher-inaugural-welcome-2017#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> and where the hearts of instructors and students can be fully "knit together in unity and in love."<a href="/speeches/david-pulsipher-inaugural-welcome-2017#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> To the task of building this uncommon community, full of divine possibility and influence, we, the faculty of BYU-Idaho, pledge our full support and extend to you our most heartfelt welcome. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>General Authority Seventy</p>
<p>Elder Kim B. Clark was sustained as a General Authority Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 4, 2015. At the time of his call he had been serving as the president of Brigham Young University-Idaho since 2005. He served as a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy, Idaho Area, from 2007 to 2014. He is currently serving as the Church Commissioner of Education.<br /><br />Elder Clark received a bachelor of arts, a master of arts, and a PhD, all in economics, from Harvard University. He became a faculty member at the Harvard Business School in 1978 and was named dean of that school in 1995. He served in that capacity until the summer of 2005, when he was named the president of Brigham Young University-Idaho.<br /><br />Elder Clark has served in a number of Church callings, including full-time missionary in the South German Mission, elders quorum president, ward executive secretary, counselor in a bishopric, bishop, high councilor, and counselor in a stake mission presidency.<br /><br />Kim Bryce Clark was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on March 20, 1949. He married Sue Lorraine Hunt in June 1971. They are the parents of seven children.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /></p>
<p>I am grateful to be here on another great day at BYU-Idaho. The inauguration of a new president is a time of reflection and anticipation. In that spirit, I invite you to ponder these words of the Lord given to the Prophet Joseph in 1832:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to exert the powers of heaven; ye cannot see it now, yet a little while, and ye shall see it, and know that I am, and that I will come and reign with my people.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, we can see it; we can see the hand of the Lord in His kingdom and in this school. BYU-Idaho has been created and set apart by the hand of the Lord through His living prophets. It has been set apart for His work and His purposes. It has been set apart from the world to be a different kind of university. <br /><br />At the heart of BYU-Idaho is the heritage of Ricks College&mdash;an abiding commitment to students of diverse interests and abilities; to deep learning of mind, heart, body, and spirit; to teaching one-by-one by the power of the Holy Ghost; to lives of faith in Jesus Christ, love, sacrifice, humility, obedience, frugality, and hard work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Building on that heritage, the Lord has raised up BYU-Idaho to educate growing numbers of young people who will do important work in their families, in their communities, and in His kingdom. He has sent the people of BYU-Idaho on His errand to improve learning while serving more students at a lower cost for each one. That has required the people here to do hard things, things that in a traditional university might seem almost impossible. Consider three examples:</p>
<p>I could go on. Making these things happen (and they have happened at BYU-Idaho) is only possible through the love, mercy, and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. He has brought people to this campus blessed with remarkable gifts and talents. They have come with great faith and consecration. They have given heart and soul to the Lord and to this school, and the Lord has blessed them with revelation. He has magnified their capacity, and they have accomplished seemingly impossible things.<br /><br />Having done all of that, they remain humble, faithful, and committed to doing even more. And there is much more to be done.&nbsp; <br /><br />The people of BYU-Idaho remind me of Ammon, that great missionary to the Lamanites, who said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore, I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things.<sup>2</sup><span style="font-size: 8.33333px;"><br /></span></p>
<p>I, too, marvel at what the Lord has done through the remarkable people of BYU-Idaho. Your new president, Henry J. Eyring, and his wife, Kelly, are two of those people. The Lord prepared them, over a long period of time. He brought them here, and He has tutored them and blessed them. I have been an eyewitness to that process. May I offer a personal word about my friend, Henry. The great spirit of this place&mdash;its values, its character, its very nature&mdash;is in Henry's heart and soul. There is a beautiful alignment between who Henry is and the very essence of this school. His roots here are deep. <br /><br />I close with a passage of scripture that summarizes my message today. Speaking of the people in the school in Zion, the Lord said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Verily, I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice&mdash;yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command&mdash;they are accepted of me. <br />For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit. <sup>3</sup></p>
<p>These words were spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ. I bear witness of Him. He is the living Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, and He speaks the truth. His words describe Henry and Kelly Eyring, they describe the people of BYU-Idaho, and they describe this remarkable university. May it ever be so. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
<p><strong>Elder Dale G. Renlund</strong> was named an Apostle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on October 3, 2015.<br /><br />Elder Renlund had served as a General Authority Seventy since April 2009 prior to being named to the Quorum of the Twelve. He previously served in the presidency of the Africa Southeast Area. &nbsp; <br /><br />After receiving B.A. and M.D. degrees from the University of Utah, Elder Renlund received further medical and research training at Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was a Professor of Medicine at the University of Utah and the Medical Director of the Utah Transplantation Affiliated Hospitals (UTAH) Cardiac Transplant Program. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Renlund has served in numerous church callings including full-time missionary in Sweden, stake president, bishop, and Area Seventy. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Renlund was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, in November 1952. He married Ruth Lybbert in 1977. They are the parents of one daughter.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sister Ruth Lybbert Renlund</strong>, was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. She is one of six children born to Merlin and Nola Lybbert. She married Elder Dale G. Renlund in 1977 in the Salt Lake Temple. She and Elder Renlund are the parents of one daughter, Ashley.</p>
<p>Sister Renlund graduated from the University of Utah in 1976 with a bachelor's degree in history. She graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law with her Juris doctorate in 1986. She practiced law at the Utah Attorney General's office for three years and then joined the firm of Dewsnup, King, and Olsen, where she practiced plaintiff's civil litigation for twenty years. She was serving as the president of the firm at the time of Elder Renlund's call as a General Authority. She served on the board of directors for Deseret News and Workers Compensation Fund of Utah and as chair of the Judicial Conduct Commission for the state of Utah. She was also the first female president of the Utah Trial Lawyers Association.</p>
<p>Sister Renlund has served in multiple church callings including gospel doctrine teacher, Young Women president, Relief Society president, and in a stake Young Women presidency.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Elder Renlund:<br /></strong>Brothers and sisters, we are here to witness that "He will heal those who trust Him and make their hearts as gold."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> I am here by assignment. My wife is here because I twisted her arm. I have found that people like me better if they've met her first.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time I met President James E. Faust, who served in the First Presidency, he came up to me and he hit me very hard in the shoulder. Now, his wife was Ruth Wright Faust. After he hit me hard in the shoulder, he said, "You and I have something in common." &nbsp; <br /><br />I said, "What?" &nbsp; <br /><br />He said, "When our wives are away, we're both 'ruthless.'" &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund:</strong> <br />So, I am here to ensure that he is not "ruthless" today. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund:</strong> <br />Last week we were just so thrilled to be here for the installation of President Henry J. Eyring. We traveled up in a van, and we had Elder and Sister Oaks there, but importantly for what I'll share now is we were seated right in between Elder Kim Clark and his wife, and Elder Bednar and his wife. The whole trip up and the whole trip back was probably a total of eight hours. For seven and a half hours of that, they extolled the value of BYU-Idaho. They told us over and over again what a unique place it was. After three and a half hours, I said, "Okay, all right, I'm converted. You can stop selling." &nbsp; <br /><br />They said, "No," and they kept talking. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sister Renlund:</strong> <br />There's more to say! &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund:</strong> <br />There was more to say.</p>
<p>After a total of seven and a half hours out of eight hours, I finally said, "Okay, I get it. If I were young, why would I go anyplace besides BYU-Idaho?" and one of them said, "Well, you wouldn't." They recognized then that I had understood the lesson they were teaching me, and with this very pleased countenance we talked about something else for thirty minutes. &nbsp; <br /><br />Sister Renlund and I are just so grateful to be with you today. Please know of our love and confidence in you. We appreciate your efforts to seek an education and your desire to be here at BYU-Idaho. We are grateful to the faculty and administration here. &nbsp; <br /><br />But we also recognize something else. No matter how wonderful the faculty is, no matter how terrific the administration is, no matter how much they plan and organize, it really is generations of students who have learned at Ricks College and then BYU-Idaho who have gone about making a difference. It really is up to you, as you go out, whether you will face the withering fire of those fiery darts of the adversary and stay true or whether you will cower behind shields. I am confident, based on what I've been taught, that this is a unique place that helps disciples of Christ go forward. Thank you all for taking the time to be with us today. &nbsp; <br /><br />As was mentioned, I was sustained as the most junior member of the Quorum of the Twelve on October 3, 2015, in the Saturday afternoon session of general conference. &nbsp; <br /><br />Just after the session concluded, at 4:05 p.m., I received a text message from my scary-smart sister; she is an honest-to-goodness rocket scientist. She had not known of my call to the Twelve until she heard it announced at the beginning of the session. &nbsp; <br /><br />Her text message began, "Dear Dale: Congratulations on being the 100th individual appointed to the Quorum of the Twelve in this dispensation." It is true; I am number 100. Elder Rasband is 98, Elder Stevenson is number 99, and I am number 100. My sister continued, "You are the only living binary Apostle." That means there are only zeros and ones in the number. But then she included a summary of prior binary Apostles: "#001, Thomas B. Marsh, excommunicated 1839. #010, Orson Pratt, excommunicated 1842." &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund:</strong> <br />Bad trend! &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund:</strong> <br />"#011, John F. Boynton, excommunicated 1837." And then "#100, Dale G. Renlund, ??." &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund:</strong> <br />We have faith in you, dear. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund:</strong> <br />Thank you. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund:</strong> <br />Much has happened in the two years since that call, and in April of this year, we had the opportunity to help with the open house at the Paris France Temple before it was dedicated by President Henry B. Eyring on Sunday, May 21. The temple is spectacular, every detail beautiful, and assisting on the tours was a treat. The temple is located between the cities of Le Chesnay and Versailles, outside of Paris. &nbsp; <br /><br />For a variety of cultural and practical reasons, there is neither an angel Moroni on the temple, nor are there any spires. However, located on the temple grounds is this beautiful <em>Christus</em> statue. You'll recognize it.</p>
<p><img alt="Statue of Christ in Paris" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Statue-of-Christ-at-Paris-Temple_218x300.jpg" width="218" /><br /><br />It is a copy of the 1838 original masterpiece by the Danish sculptor Bertil Thorvaldsen. This statue provides a focal point in the gardens and declares, to all who come, our belief in Jesus Christ. The majesty, size, and setting are captivating. Visitors are drawn to this portrayal of the risen Lord and frequently want to stand there to get their pictures taken. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund:</strong> <br />The statue is frequently referred to as <em>Christus Consolator</em>. A consolator is one who consoles.<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> To console means to comfort another at a time of grief or disappointment, to give solace, sympathize with, commiserate with, or show compassion for another.<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> For us, the <em>Christus</em> statue conveys these divine attributes of the Savior.</p>
<p><img alt="Christus Consolator" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Christus-Consolator_215x300.jpg" width="215" /><br /><br />The original <em>Christus Consolator</em> is located in <em>Vor Frue Kirke</em>, the Church of Our Lady, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Surrounded by statues of the Twelve Apostles, the <em>Christus</em> is in a columned alcove. Above and below the statue are inscriptions of well-known verses from the Bible. &nbsp; <br /><br />Inscribed at the top, in the panel above the two columns, are these words, in Danish: "DENNE ER MIN S&Oslash;N DEN ELSKELIGE H&Oslash;RER HAM." In English: "This is my beloved Son: hear him." &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund: </strong> <br />These words were spoken by God, our Heavenly Father, as Jesus was transfigured on a mountain in front of Peter, James, and John. The complete verse, taken from Mark, says, "And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son: hear him."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund:</strong> <br />On the pedestal on which the <em>Christus Consolator</em> stands are these words, in Danish: "KOMMER TIL MIG." In English: "Come unto me." Of all the words that the Savior spoke, nothing is more pleading and important for us than "Come unto Christ." &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund: </strong> <br />The complete verse, as recorded in Matthew says, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />With this original statue of <em>Christus Consolator,</em> we have both the Father's invitation to hear His Only Begotten Son and the Son's invitation to come unto Him. In perfect unity, They invite all to hear and to come. <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund: </strong> <br />This is our way back to our heavenly home. "We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> Each person can only come unto Christ by receiving the restored gospel. We "receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and in His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn7" title="">[7]</a> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund: </strong> <br />This is the unified message of the Father and the Son. They want all Heavenly Father's children to follow the doctrine of Christ. Now, just so there is no confusion, when we use the phrase "the doctrine of Christ," it means the same as the gospel of Christ. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund: </strong> <br />To emphasize the unity of the Father and the Son in Their message regarding the doctrine of Christ, let's look at this chart.</p>
<p><img alt="Scripture Chart" height="145" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Scripture-Chart_400x145.jpg" width="400" /><br /><br />We know that the chapters noted here (2 Nephi 31, 3 Nephi 9, 3 Nephi 11, and 3 Nephi 27) contain the doctrine of Christ. These chapters frequently mention faith, repentance, baptism, the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. The number of times each element is mentioned is tabulated. As you can see, faith is mentioned 8 times; repentance, 13 times; baptism, 25 times; Holy Ghost, 16 times; and enduring to the end, 7 times.</p>
<p><img alt="Scripture Chart" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Scripture-Chart_400x145.jpg" />&nbsp;<br /><br />*Includes unambiguous Him/He/His and one Father unambiguously speaking; does not include 1 ambiguous He. &nbsp; <br /><br />What may be surprising, however, is that we also find the Father referenced many times in these chapters. In fact, He is specifically mentioned 62 times, more than the number of times baptism is mentioned. From this we can know that the doctrine of Christ is the doctrine of both the Father and the Son. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund:</strong> <br />Let's take a closer look at a couple of references to the Father. "And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son. &nbsp; <br /><br />"And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.... &nbsp; <br /><br />"And I [Nephi] heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />The Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost testify this is the only way. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund: </strong> <br />Echoing the words from Matthew, the Father and the Son tell us that we should come unto Christ, take His yoke on us because the burdens we bear can be made light, and we can find rest. We all carry burdens. We may be burdened with sin, sorrow, addiction, sickness, guilt, or shame. In these difficulties, looking to Christ brings healing and hope and consolation. "He will heal those who trust Him and make their hearts as gold." &nbsp; <br /><br />The doctrine of Christ--faith, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost--is not intended to be experienced as a one-time event. Our theology teaches us that we become perfected by repeatedly and iteratively "relying wholly upon" the doctrine of Christ.<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> This means that we repeat the steps in the doctrine of Christ throughout our lives. Each step builds on the preceding step, and the sequence is intended to be experienced over and over again. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sister Renlund:</strong> <br />As we exercise faith, it grows stronger. As we continually seek to repent, we improve. We can, through our own efforts, progress from having occasional experiences with the Holy Ghost to having Him as a constant companion. In addition, as we go through life, we can learn of Christ's attributes and develop these same qualities.<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> As we become more and more like Christ, our hearts are changed, and we are able to endure to the end.<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />It is easy to see how all the steps in the doctrine of Christ can be repeated and built on throughout life. But what about baptism? We are, after all, baptized for ourselves just once. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund:</strong> <br />To answer this question, we should consider a theological masterpiece written by Elder James E. Talmage titled <em>The Articles of Faith</em>.<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> It was first published in 1899 and has answered questions about the Church and its foundational teachings for subsequent generations who have read and studied it.</p>
<p><img alt="The Articles of Faith" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/The-Articles-of-Faith_300x225.jpg" width="300" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />In the table of contents,<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> we see that each chapter, aside from the introductory one, is associated with one of the thirteen articles of faith. Some articles of faith are covered in more than one chapter, but each chapter is associated with one article of faith.</p>
<p><img alt="Content page" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Contents-Page_300x225.jpg" width="300" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Interestingly, chapter 9,<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> titled "The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper," appears right after the chapter about the Holy Ghost. As you can see, Elder Talmage associates it with article of faith number four. <br /><br /> <img alt="Chapter 9" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/chapter-9_300x225.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />At the beginning of chapter 9, Elder Talmage wrote, "In the course of our study of the principles and ordinances of the Gospel, as specified in the fourth of the Articles of Faith, the subject of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper very properly claims attention, the observance of this ordinance being required of all who have become members of the Church of Christ through compliance with the requirements of faith, repentance, and baptism by water and of the Holy Ghost."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund: </strong> <br />With those words in mind, we can see why Talmage associates the sacrament with the fourth article of faith. The sacrament is the next ordinance everyone needs after being confirmed a member of the Church. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund: </strong> <br />The sacrament is the next ordinance a man needs after receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund: </strong> <br />The sacrament is the next ordinance individuals need after being endowed in the temple. &nbsp; <strong>Elder Renlund: </strong> The sacrament is the next ordinance a couple needs after being sealed. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund: </strong> <br />The sacrament is the next ordinance <em>you</em> need. The sacrament is key to our faith in Jesus Christ, repenting of sin and feeling the influence of the Holy Ghost in our lives. It is the mechanism by which we renew the covenants and blessings of baptism. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund: </strong> <br />The Church handbook says this: "Church members are commanded to gather together often to partake of the sacrament to remember the Savior always and to renew the covenants and blessings of baptism."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> You may ask, "What blessings?" Certainly, a continuing endowment of the Holy Spirit is a blessing of baptism. But is the cleansing effect of baptism, one of its most wonderful blessings, also renewed? &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund:</strong> <br />I think the answer is yes. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund:</strong> <br />I do too. Consider this statement made by Elder Dallin H. Oaks in 2010. "We are commanded to repent of our sins and come to the Lord with a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Then we partake of the sacrament in compliance with its covenants.... [W]e witness that we are willing to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and always remember Him and keep His commandments. When we renew our baptismal covenants in this way, the Lord renews the cleansing effect of our baptism. In this way, we are made clean and receive the promise that we can always have His spirit to be with us."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Let me caution, though, that "the sacrament has not been established as a specific means of securing remission of sins."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> In other words, you cannot willfully sin Saturday night and expect to be miraculously forgiven by taking a piece of bread and drinking a little water on Sunday. Repentance is a more involved process requiring remorse and forsaking of sin. And pre-planned repentance is repugnant to the Savior. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund: </strong> <br />We qualify for the cleansing power of Jesus Christ when we partake of the sacrament worthily.<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> This is the way that we keep ourselves "unspotted from the world."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> The sacrament of the Lord's Supper rightfully substitutes for baptism in the repeated and iterative application of the doctrine of Christ in the progression of Latter-day Saints toward perfection. &nbsp; <br /><br />We are to follow this path, "substituting" the ordinance of the sacrament for the step of baptism. Preparation for the sacrament requires forethought and attention. You cannot expect the sacrament to be a spiritual experience if you are scurrying about, texting on your phones, or otherwise distracted. &nbsp; <br /><br />So come early to Church. As the sacrament hymn begins, make sure your thoughts are focused on the Savior, His Atonement, His love, and His compassion. Pray that you will be renewed as you partake of the sacrament and remember Him. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund: </strong> <br />I would like to share what we learned about the sacrament from members of the Church in Kigali, Rwanda. The background to the story is that in 1994 there was a horrific genocide in Rwanda. Between 600,000 and 900,000 people were killed in a matter of 60 to 90 days. &nbsp; <br /><br />Eventually, the Church established a branch in the capital city of Kigali. The branch was doing well, without full-time missionaries. In 2011, Ruth and I were serving in that Africa Southeast Area when we learned, sadly, that our registration as a church with the country of Rwanda was invalid, which meant that we were functioning illegally as a church. We also learned that our meetinghouse, a converted two-story home, was not appropriately zoned to hold church meetings. For these reasons, the Area Presidency, in consultation with our first contact in the Quorum of the Twelve, made the agonizing decision to close the branch. Our members were no longer able to meet for church meetings. &nbsp; <br /><br />Lawyers in Kigali, Johannesburg, and Salt Lake City began working fervently and feverishly and hopefully to resolve the problems. Nothing seemed to work. Brick walls were hit at every turn. All the while, the Saints kept asking when they could meet together again. Months went by without resolution or progress. &nbsp; <br /><br />After 9 to 10 months, Ruth and I decided to fly to Kigali to visit those Saints and try to buoy up their spirits. Before we did, I asked that the matter be placed on the temple prayer roll of the weekly meeting of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. &nbsp; <br /><br />The Tuesday before our scheduled trip from Johannesburg to Kigali, we were notified that, in a surprising move, the government had granted the Church provisional registration in the city of Kigali. Then, on Thursday of the same week, in another surprising move, the Zoning Commission granted an exemption from the zoning ordinance. The Kigali Saints could once again meet in our building without violating the law. &nbsp; <br /><br />This was miraculous! Members were quickly notified that the branch would be meeting on Sunday. Ruth and I arrived on Friday and invited members to come to church. The members cleaned and prepared the building enthusiastically. When Sunday came, all the members--all of them--and many of their friends came to church. They arrived early, eager to be together again. As the sacrament was blessed and passed, we all experienced an extraordinary renewing, refreshing, and cleansing spirit. &nbsp; <br /><br />I remember, in the meeting, wondering why I did not feel this same spirit every week as I partook of the sacrament. I looked around at the Saints, and I realized that they had come hungering and thirsting for the sacrament. Their faith, diligence, and patience brought all of us blessings. I pledged to myself that whenever I again partook of the sacrament, I would remember this experience with the Kigali Saints. I committed that I too would hunger for the blessings of partaking of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper.</p>
<p><img alt="Kigali Saints" height="145" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Kigali-Saints_400x145.jpg" width="400" /><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund: </strong> <br />I remember that sacrament meeting so well. The Kigali Saints had anticipated for months the opportunity to partake of the sacrament. They brought a remarkable spirit that inspired me. &nbsp; <br /><br />You will recall that after the Savior instituted the sacrament among the Nephites, He told them that the sacrament was the key to establishing themselves on His rock. He said, "And I give unto you a commandment that ye shall do these things [partake of the sacrament]. And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my rock. &nbsp; <br /><br />"But whoso among you shall do more or less than these are not built upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon them, they shall fall."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />The sacrament is a beautiful gift we receive each Sunday that helps us in our earthly progression. Through the sacrament, we experience an important element of the doctrine of Christ, bringing us closer to our Savior and experiencing His love and forgiveness in our lives. I am grateful for these moments each week, which help me stay focused on my Savior. &nbsp; <br /><br />A friend of ours in South Africa shared how she came to this realization. When Diane was a new convert, she attended a branch outside of Johannesburg, South Africa.</p>
<p><img alt="Diane" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Diane_200x300.jpg" width="200" /> <br /><br />One Sunday, as she sat in the congregation, the layout of the chapel made it so that the deacon did not see her as the sacrament was passed. Diane was disappointed but said nothing. Another member noted the omission and mentioned it to the branch president after the meeting. As Sunday School began, Diane was invited to an empty classroom. &nbsp; <br /><br />A priesthood holder came in. He knelt down, blessed some bread, and handed her a piece. She ate it. He knelt down again and blessed some water and handed her a small cup. She drank it. Diane had two thoughts in rapid succession: first, "Oh, he [the priesthood holder] did this just for me," and then, "Oh, He [the Savior] did this just for me." Through the sacrament, Diane felt Heavenly Father's love just for her. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund:</strong> <br />Her realization that the Savior's sacrifice was just for her helped her feel close to Him and fueled an overwhelming desire to keep that feeling in her heart--not just on Sunday but every day. She realized that although she sat in a congregation to partake of the sacrament, the covenants she made anew each Sunday were individually hers. The sacrament helped--and continues to help--Diane feel the power of godly love, recognize the Lord's hand in her life, and draw closer to the Savior.<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Our invitation is the same as Moroni's: "Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Sister Renlund: </strong> <br />"And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />This happens as we apply the doctrine of Christ, viewing the sacrament as the substitute for baptism. In this way we can "[rely] wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save."<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />I am so grateful for the sacrament, how it teaches me each week, reminds me each week, of what my Savior did for me. I am so grateful to Him because I know He atoned just for me. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp; <strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Elder Renlund: </strong> <br />When the Savior spoke to the Nephites, he said <em>when</em> rain, wind, and floods come. He didn't say <em>if</em>, and in fact rain, winds, and floods come to everyone. But He told us that the way that we are established on His rock is to look to Him as we partake of the sacrament.<a href="/devotionals/elder-and-sister-dale-g-renlund#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a> The time will come, in each of your lives, when there will be a hesitation to go to church and partake of the sacrament. If it hasn't happened yet, it will. But know this: if you follow the Savior's direction and go and partake of the sacrament, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, blessings will pour upon you that will keep you firm, that will keep you solid, that will keep you established on that firm foundation that is Jesus Christ. Your decision to do so will affect eternity. You will establish yourself upon Jesus Christ, the author and finisher of our faith. &nbsp; <br /><br />I know that He lives. I know it. I know that Joseph saw what he said he saw in 1820, and I know that priesthood keys are on earth today that enable the ordinance of the sacrament to be carried out and enable saving and exalting ordinances. It is my prayer that God will watch over and bless you, that you choose to follow Him, that you choose to partake of the sacrament after preparing for it and partaking of it worthily. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pre-devotional Discussion:&nbsp;</strong>On the <a href="https://byui.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/323102/viewContent/4632613/View?ou=323102">discussion board</a>, share about a time in your life when a trial became a stepping&nbsp;stone instead of a stumbling block.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. I am honored and humbled for the opportunity to address all of you today, and I pray that I will have the Spirit with me, to speak the things the Lord would have me say, and the Spirit will be with you, to hear it, for I testify that I know the Lord can and will help us through life's trials if we will put our trust in Him and move forward in faith.<br /><br />In order to put this in some kind of order, I thought I would share first with you the story of a woman I have known my whole life. Maybe some of her struggles will mirror some of yours or someone you know and are close to. The story starts like this: her challenges in life, unbeknownst to her, started when she was just a six-year-old little girl, unaware of the problems that were soon to be placed in her path by no decision of her own. Through the choices of someone else, she was placed in a state of sexual abuse that would last for about the next two years of her life. This created a change in her that her parents could see but could not identify why. According to her parents, she became angry, not as outgoing and fun-loving as she once was. They identified this with starting grade school but did not find out till almost 20 years later that the change in her had come from this abuse. The abuse stopped when she was eight years old, just before she was baptized. Her abuser thought if it was stopped by then, the damage would be corrected, but by then it was too late; the damage had already been done. &nbsp; <br /><br />This created in her, an incorrect perception of how she needed to obtain love and attention. By the time she was 14 years old, she was sexually active, and pregnant by the time she was 16. She dropped out of school her sophomore year to get married and said goodbye to her childhood forever. She now was a child raising a child. Her parents had tried to talk her out of getting married so young. They wanted her to finish school and had offered to adopt her child as their own so that she could have the opportunity to finish, but she knew best. There was nothing they could do to convince her otherwise. She wanted out of the house and was going to get out one way or the other. &nbsp; <br /><br />The next few years would show the delivery of a little girl, followed by a divorce, then a remarriage to the same man--who was and still to this point was a major drug addict--followed by three more children. &nbsp; <br /><br />This time was very difficult for her because, as I had mentioned, he was a drug addict and became even more emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive, so the support that was needed was not available. I do not have the time in this devotional to even address a portion of what that all entailed, only that it was an extremely difficult time in her life. This time the marriage would end for good, with her husband being unfaithful. She was finally done. She could not handle any more and filed for divorce in 1988. She felt like the world had been lifted off of her shoulders, but like so many others that have fallen into abusive-like patterns, she had too, and jumped right back into another relationship with another guy who didn't have any better habits than her ex. And before long, he was slowly moving in, little by little. &nbsp; <br /><br />She was working for a grocery food chain and had a good working reputation. She succeeded at pretty much any position that she put her hand to, but her personal life was not all what she wanted it to be. Then one day a situation happened to her that changed her whole life and put her back on the road to her Father in Heaven. She was checking out groceries, and a person came through the line next to her that would change her life forever. She went home that weekend and had an experience that helped her understand personally what Alma the Younger went through. &nbsp; <br /><br />Alma 36 reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.<br />"Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept His holy commandments.<br />"... Yea, and in fine, so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror....<br />"And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.<br />"And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world."<a href="/devotionals/melanie-walker#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>It was at this time that she immediately got all of the belongings together of the guy she was in the relationship with and took them next door to his friend's house, where his jeep was parked, and distributed his belongings back to him. She was afraid if she did this any other way, she might lose her nerve and not go through with it. After cleaning up in the material sense, she located the bishop over the area where she lived and made the appointment with him so she could clean up in the spiritual sense. By this time, she had been inactive for about 10 years. She knew there was a chance that she could be excommunicated, but it didn't matter anymore; all she wanted was to get her life back in order and right with the Lord. The kind of life she really wanted was never going to happen if she kept living the life she was. She needed to jump in with both feet and use the Atonement in her life, to whatever end, or beginning, that may bring. She knew she was not ready for the blessings of the kind of marriage she wanted to come into her life at that time, but she would be ready for those blessings in the future, if or when the opportunity would arise again. &nbsp; <br /><br />So, in case you have not guessed, the young girl in the story is me. I say "is" instead of "was" because I want to claim all parts of that experience that has played a major role in who I am today. It continues to play a significant role in how I live through the choices I make in my life every day. &nbsp; <br /><br />My appointment with my bishop proved to be an amazing experience. I likened it to one of my favorite scriptures during that time in my life, for I spent many hours in them. I had a hunger to feel of the Spirit and the sweetness of the Atonement working in my life on a daily basis. &nbsp; <br /><br />Enos 1 reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God, before I received a remission of my sins....<br />"And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.<br />"And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed."<a href="/devotionals/melanie-walker#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>The struggles increased for a while because the devil does not want to let go of someone that he has had so much control over. Sometimes the battle was almost too much to bear, but I was blessed with a very loving earthly father, who at times would give me a blessing daily so that I could resist the temptations and craziness that my previous life had helped create for me. &nbsp; <br /><br />C. S. Lewis has a quote that describes how I used to feel about life, but now I know better because I have had experience on both sides. It reads, "A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is.... A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later. That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness. They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in."<a href="/devotionals/melanie-walker#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />My dad was my hero! He had been quite sick most of my life and almost died one night, but he shared with me a blessing that was given to him, stating that his life was to be extended for three years so he could get the rest of his family in order. The rest of his family was me. He passed away a year after I married my spouse, who sits with me here on the stage today--three years total after the blessing he had received. &nbsp; <br /><br />The topic I have chosen to talk about today is "Conversion in the Fires of Affliction." I chose this topic because if we choose God in our afflictions, and we don't turn away from Him, He will sanctify them to our good, and our conversion will deepen and become stronger and stronger. &nbsp; <br /><br />I had finally received my patriarchal blessing, and many other wonderful experiences had started to take place in my life, but I still doubted my worthiness to enter God's holy temple. I was kind of being silly yet very serious in the prayer I offered upon entering one day. I prayed that if I had not yet repented enough for what I had done, "Please let the men at the recommend desk not let me in. Please let them feel that I am not worthy to be here." Well, I made it past the first desk, so then I was praying that one of the workers may have a feeling that I shouldn't be here. (Do you ever find that you hold on to sin or mistakes to re-punish and re-punish yourself, making it a tool for the devil instead of using the Atonement as a tool from God?) &nbsp; <br /><br />What I was hoping for was some validation that I was in good standing with the Lord, enough to be in His holy house. I was doing initiatory work that day when, out of the blue, the temple worker asked me if I was okay. I didn't answer right away, so she followed by asking me a very inspired question. She asked, "Have you taken proper means to take care of the sins of your past?" I about fell over. How did she know what I was praying for? I knew right then I was getting an answer to my prayers, just like l had asked God for, validated to me by one of His servants. I said to her, "Yes." Then she said something very profound to me in that moment that changed my heart. She said, "Then let it go!" &nbsp; <br /><br />Alma 36:21 reads, "Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy." &nbsp; <br /><br />When they say that there is opposition in all things, I knew in that moment exactly what that meant to me, for in that moment no words could describe the joy I felt. I knew I had taken the proper steps for repentance, and it was time to "let it go!" &nbsp; <br /><br />During the next seven years, I would marry my husband, here with me today, and we would have two more children together. This would now give us six children, and we had been praying on a regular basis for the blessing to have our first four sealed into our family. This seemed like a blessing that would never happen, but the Lord works in mysterious ways and works other people's bad choices for the good of others. My ex had committed a felony, and his probation officer had contacted me to state some stipulations that I would like put on his probation decree. I requested that he pay his child support and medical obligations that were to the amount of about $6,000, or give up his rights as their father. It came as a great blessing to our family that he chose to give up his rights, and our family was sealed on February 18, 1995. &nbsp; <br /><br />That was a great blessing that turned out to be even more amazing than we would have any idea, for later that year, on September 12, at about 4:05 in the afternoon, the Lord would call our oldest son home. <br /><br />&nbsp; <img alt="Son with friends" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Son_with_friends_265x200.jpg" width="265" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This is a picture of Tyler with his buddies the day before he was taken home. He was seven years old when this happened. Remember I had said that we were sealed as a family on February 18, 1995. That just happened to be his birthday. He was so excited that we were finally being sealed, and to have it happen on his birthday was an amazing, tender mercy from the Lord. &nbsp; <br /><br />He was on his way to join his siblings over at the elementary school we lived across the street from. The kids had gone over there many times to play after school on the playground equipment they had there. The neighbor boy was driving back to his house with a propane container his dad had sent him to the store to fill. They had eye contact with each other, and so the boy thought he was safe to continue on his way when my son bolted across the road. I had been resting on the couch when I heard the noise and went to the door to see what had happened. &nbsp; <br /><br />I stepped out on the porch to see the neighbor boy running my direction down the road. My first thought was he had just wrecked his dad's pickup into the telephone pole, but soon realized he was running to our house. He cried out, "I just hit your son. Call an ambulance." At that very moment, I knew what it was like to have the Holy Ghost with me. He immediately strengthened me in a way I knew was not my own. I had complete clarity of thought and made the call to 911 to get the ambulance on its way. Then I called my husband at work to get him on his way home. I proceeded out the door to where a crowd had now gathered around my son. &nbsp; <br /><br />The principal of the school was there and asked me if I would like for him to give our son a priesthood blessing. I just remember feeling so relieved that he would offer, and quickly agreed. The words that were pronounced upon Tyler, I know for me, made the outcome something I could accept. He said he would live until proper medical help arrived; at that time, the Lord would decide whether he was to live or die. In that moment, there was absolutely no doubt in my mind the Lord was in control. I needed this peace in my life, especially now, because I was seven months pregnant with our seventh child. &nbsp; <br /><br />I had found the boy that had hit him, and all I wanted to do at that moment was to help him. I knew in that moment the pain and fear he must be going through was one test I would never want to experience. I held him and told him I did not blame him. Somehow the Holy Ghost worked a miracle in us that day, and my heart, through the Spirit, was filled with forgiveness and compassion for him. &nbsp; <br /><br />I returned to Tyler, and as I knelt beside him, I knew that he was gone. It was at that moment I came to realize what we feel when we are around others is their spirit, for at that moment, my father, whom I was very close to but who had died a few years prior, was behind me. I felt his presence so strong there was no doubt in my mind he had come to take Tyler home. &nbsp; <br /><br />For me, this loss was full of many tender mercies and spiritual experiences. Some are too sacred to share, but I will tell you this: I came to know the Comforter personally, and I know there is life after death and that our Heavenly Father is in all the workings of our lives. &nbsp; <br /><br />The young boy that hit him went on to serve a mission and, while out in the mission field, wrote a story about this experience. It was published in the March 2000 issue of the <em>New Era.</em> The talk is titled "Can I Be Forgiven?" He and his family are dear friends of ours to this day, and I know that, for me, this part of my testimony has been deeply rooted, for it would need to be, because in February of 2009, our second son was called home.<br /><br /><img alt="Drawing of sons" height="255" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Drawing_of_sons_200x255.jpg" width="200" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This is an age-progression picture of the boys, done by a family friend. They were only three years apart in age, almost to the date, Tyler being born on February 18, 1988, and Trevor being born on February 17, 1991. They were very close and would play together all the time. &nbsp; <br /><br />When Tyler died, we could not get Trevor to sleep in his bed for three years. We would keep him with us or one of his sisters until he fell asleep, then put him to bed, only to find him on the landing at the top of the stairs just outside of his bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;<img alt="picture of son" height="250" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture_of_son_175x250.jpg" width="175" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Trevor was a good boy, the kind, I feel, that most parents would want to claim as their child and be proud of. He was involved in orchestra and sang with a singing group in school called the Bel Cantos. He was a straight-A student and loved the gospel. There were many times on a Sunday that we would wonder where he was, as the rest of us were watching a TV program, and he would be off reading the <em>Ensign,</em> still dressed in his Sunday clothes. &nbsp; <br /><br />Five days after his 18th birthday was a Sunday. He had just had his priesthood interview with the bishop and been found worthy to be made an elder. Now it was just waiting until stake conference came to ordain and sustain him with the rest of his friends that were becoming elders at the same time. He passed away the very next day on the way to school. The roads had been terribly icy that morning, and he lost control on the road. He slid into a telephone pole. Again, I get the call that no parent wants to hear once, let alone twice. &nbsp; <br /><br />At first, I felt, "Okay, we've done this before; we can do it again." I felt his presence with me every day, having many more spiritual experiences with this trial, but something seemed to be changing this time. After about three months, I found myself getting angrier and angrier with the Lord. How could He take another son? I found myself slipping into depression, but even more than that, I was having anxiety so bad that I couldn't even fall into a deep sleep. It seemed like everything that I had ever been through was haunting me now. There was fear and panic, literally 24/7. This went on for about three months, to the point that now I was becoming suicidal. My husband was begging me to get on some anxiety pills, for fear of what was going to happen to me. I took time to pray about this decision and was told this was not the way the Lord wanted me to handle this. I was to learn my source of strength was to come through Him. &nbsp; <br /><br />About this time, my husband had given me a book titled <em>The Infinite Atonement,</em> by Tad Callister. I didn't get into it right away; in fact, it took me about another month to pick it up and start reading it. But once I did, it had such a profound impact on my life. For the first time ever, I realized the Atonement was so much more than a process used for repentance. I realized that the Atonement was literally part of Jesus Christ Himself, with all the enabling powers of His grace that He gives to us in our weaknesses, if we will but submit to Him. &nbsp; <br /><br />Ether 12:27 reads, "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them." &nbsp; <br /><br />2 Corinthians 12:10 reads, "Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong." &nbsp; <br /><br />There are two stories addressed in the Bible: one is about Moses; the other, Enoch. Both were men of God, and both happened to have the same weakness. They were both slow of speech and wondered why the Lord had chosen them to be mighty instruments in His hands. The Lord promised both He would put into their mouths the things which they needed to say at the time that it needed to be said. Moses doubted and was given Aaron to be a spokesman for him. Because of this, Moses's weakness never became a strength. Yes, it's true that God still performed mighty miracles through Moses, but the weakness of speech was never taken from him. Enoch, on the other hand, did not doubt the Lord would fulfill His promise, and he became mighty in speech. So mighty and great were the words of Enoch, he would speak and mountains would move out of their place. &nbsp; <br /><br />Moses 6:34 reads, "Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; therefore walk with me." &nbsp; <br /><br />Through much prayer and learning, the anxiety and depression were lifted. I learned different coping skills through obedience to the Lord, and my conversion deepened again. I am learning that the Holy Spirit can teach in any given circumstance if we will open our hearts to listen and ponder, especially in the toughest of times, when we feel we are being pushed far beyond our capacity to stretch. <br /><br />&nbsp;<img alt="Hiking with daughter" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Hiking_with_daughter_275x200.jpg" width="275" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I took the opportunity to hike two amazing hikes with my daughter this year. One of those hikes was Table Rock. <br /><br /><img alt="View of the Tetons" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/View_of_the_tetons_275x200.jpg" width="275" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I had always heard of this place, but this was my first attempt at this hike. I never hurt so badly at a physical event in my life. My muscles started cramping about four miles in, with three miles left to go. I found out I don't like straight-off edges and slippery, rocky slopes. I found myself at times clinging to rocks, not able to move from the fear that was setting in. I thought to myself, "This is beautiful right here. I bet the top isn't that much grander." I asked a couple of people coming back down how it was, and their comment was they wanted to quit. But they were so glad they didn't, because it was amazing. <br /><br /><img alt="With daughter at a mountain lake" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/With_daughter_by_a_lake_250x200.jpg" width="250" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Then something inside starting saying, "What if this is symbolic of your journey to the celestial kingdom?" Am I willing to settle for something less? I kept praying for divine help to work through the pain and the crippling fear I was experiencing, and then came this life lesson. I had made the decision to do this hike. I did not want to fail. If I did not look ahead or behind and I only focused on what was in front of me at that very moment, keeping a prayer in my heart, I was able to move forward one step at a time until I pulled myself over the top of that rock. <br /><br /><img alt="Mountain lake" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/mountain_lake_275x200.jpg" width="275" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The view was breathtaking, literally, and I could not hold back the tears of accomplishment. I could do hard things and was all the better for it. &nbsp; <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, our lives are meant to be full of weaknesses, hardships, and trials, but we always have a choice to make them our stumbling blocks or our stepping-stones. Just like Joseph in the Bible. All that he went through, he could have cursed God, but he chose to praise and honor God, and by so doing, all of his trials were sanctified to him for his good, and he became a savior to his people. I would like to leave you with one of my favorite scriptures that to me depicts the very gospel in action and God's willingness to bless us if we will practice it. &nbsp; <br /><br />Alma 26:22 reads, "Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing--unto such it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance." &nbsp; <br /><br />I know that whatever challenges or trials we are faced with, whether they are physical weaknesses, personality quirks, addictions, same-sex attractions, gender issues, low self-esteem, or mental health challenges, the Lord gave all of us the same directive, for He is no respecter of persons, and He is a God of order. We are to align ourselves with His will. Whatever that takes on our part to do is very personal and between the individual and the Lord, but I know we can choose to do hard things and have those trials sanctified unto us to our complete conversion unto the Lord, to make our stumbling blocks, whatever they may be, into our stepping-stones, and return home when our time here on earth is finished. &nbsp; <br /><br />I love my Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. That we may all return to live with Them again is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>My dear brothers and sisters, it is with great humility and respect that I approach this pulpit. I pray for the Spirit to be with us today--that I may successfully portray the feelings of my heart and that you may hear what the Lord would have you hear. Know too that it is an absolute honor and privilege for me to be able to stand and bear testimony of Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, latter-day prophets and apostles, and of the divinity of this church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. <br /><br />I would like to address my remarks to those who feel frustrated and overwhelmed, who are searching for faith and comfort. I desire to reassure you that Heavenly Father lives and that He loves you dearly. &nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to set the stage for my remarks by reading to you a few questions, the answers to which I hope will become evident as I proceed through my address. Think of these questions as if you were asking them yourself:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Question #1: Why does Heavenly Father allow me to suffer?<br />Question #2: I'm doing my very best; why do I struggle so much?<br />Question #3: Doesn't Heavenly Father love me?<br />Question #4: How can I find peace in my life and become like Heavenly Father and enjoy what He enjoys?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever asked yourself any of these questions? Are you entertaining any of these questions now? If you are, rest assured that most people have contemplated these very questions, including me. Let me illustrate by sharing with you the following tragic event that happened to me when I was three or four years old. It happened on a peaceful day when my older brother and I were milling around the backyard, looking for something to do. My brother came upon the idea of exploring my father's cupboard in the garage that was, by the way, strictly off limits. I reluctantly followed my brother into the garage and watched as he climbed upon the workbench and pulled the stick from the latch on the cupboard.</p>
<p><img alt="As a small boy in front of the house" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Small_boy_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />As he opened the cupboard door, he quickly located the test tubes of chemicals that my father kept there. I began to feel very uneasy and ran for the back door of our house. Unfortunately, the back door to our house was difficult to open. And weighing a mere 40 or 50 lb., there wasn't a chance that I was going to get it opened. I cried out to my mother while pounding on the door, but she, at that very moment, was vacuuming the floor and was not able to hear me. &nbsp; <br /><br />After a few moments, I resolved to return to the garage to see what my brother was doing. He had, while I was away, secured a test tube, climbed down from the workbench, and removed the tube's lid. He motioned for me to come and smell its contents. I reluctantly moved forward. As I drew near to him, he--not knowing the bottle was filled with dangerous acid--threw it on me. I was badly burned and rushed to the hospital. I still vividly remember the ambulance ride. My mother later said that she had never heard a child scream so loudly. I ended up spending many days in bed, wrapped in white bandages. And I still carry the scars of those burns to this day. <br /><br /><img alt="School picture" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/School_picture_200x300.jpg" width="200" />&nbsp;<br /><br />That was a traumatic experience in my life, one that was followed by a number of others. Time will not permit me to relate those. Nevertheless, it is sufficient to say that I seemed to be a magnet for tragic events. And many times I have had the occasion of crying out to Heavenly Father for comfort and for answers. Let me share with you some of the things I have learned. I hope that you will find them helpful. <strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong> <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>First, understand that agency is a fundamental principle of life and of Heavenly Father's plan for us</em>. Agency is vital to our personal development and feelings of joy. Understand too that with agency comes some amount of volatility and, of course, some bumps and bruises. Misfortunes <em>will</em> happen as we live and as we interact with others, and Heavenly Father is not going to step in and control every situation. Surely, a wise and loving father would not do that. To be overly controlling would rob His children of freedom, individuality, and personal development. &nbsp; <br /><br />As stated by President Spencer W. Kimball: &nbsp; <br />If all the sick for whom we pray were healed, if all the righteous were protected and the wicked destroyed, <em>the whole program of the Father would be annulled and the basic principle of the gospel, free agency, would be ended</em>.... &nbsp; <br />Should all prayers be immediately answered according to our selfish desires and our limited understanding, then there would be little or no suffering, sorrow, disappointment, or even death, <em>and if these were not, there would also be no joy, success, resurrection, nor eternal life and godhood</em>.<a href="/devotionals/patrick-powell#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Here's the bottom line: You cannot have godhood without agency, and you cannot have agency without some amount of volatility, misfortune, and pain. &nbsp; <br /><br />Not many of us can remember the time in our lives when we took our first steps. But surely, as we learned to walk, we had a few falls. And when we fell, we had a loving father or mother there to comfort, teach, and encourage us. <br /><br /><img alt="Child learning to walk" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Child_learning_to_walk_200x300.jpg" width="200" />&nbsp;<br /><br />(Now, think of the eternal parallels.) In time, we learned to walk without falling and experienced a new level of freedom. If our parents had spared us from falling, we likely would not have learned to walk. This same principle applies to our eternal development. Please know that Heavenly Father is not going to spare us from every tragedy, especially if we stubbornly pursue unwise and unhealthy courses. But know too that He will be there to comfort, teach, and encourage us and help us to develop into beings like Him. &nbsp; <br /><br />Reflect on these instructive words from the hymn "I Am a Child of God": &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Lead</em> me, <em>guide</em> me,&nbsp;<em>walk beside</em> me, (Note: It does not say, "do it for me," or "take away all of my trials," or "solve all of my problems.") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Help <em>me</em> find the way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Teach me all that <em>I</em> must do &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />To live with him someday. (And may I add "to live <em>like</em> him someday.")<a href="/devotionals/patrick-powell#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>Surely, bumps and bruises <em>will</em> come. But that will not be a sign that our Heavenly Father does not exist or does not love us. He <em>does</em> exist and will be there for us and will comfort, teach, and encourage us and help us to develop into beings like Him. Of this I bear my solemn witness.</p>
<p><em>Second, understand that problems in our lives come from a variety of sources--and that most of these are not directly from Heavenly Father</em>. True, at times they may come directly from Him. But, in my experience, they usually don't. They usually come from other sources. They may come from our physical weaknesses, genetic makeup, or temperament. They may come from the culture or environment in which we were raised. They may come from occurrences of nature, such as a forest fire or a snowstorm. They may come from our own choices. They may come from the choices of others. Regardless of the source, Heavenly Father can help us to discover and overcome these problems. As stated by the Book of Mormon prophet Ether: "And if men come unto me <em>I will show unto them their weakness</em>. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble, and my grace is sufficient for all men <em>that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, </em>then will I make weak things become strong unto them."<a href="/devotionals/patrick-powell#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, as I stated before, Heavenly Father <em>does</em> exist and will be there for us and will comfort, teach, and encourage us and help us develop into beings like Him. Be especially careful not to blame Him for all of the problems in your life. Be careful not to foster a spirit of bitterness, negativity, and skepticism and openly or subtly fight against Him, the very source of your relief<em>.</em> Not only would that approach be extremely unproductive; it is not right. If your life is filled with bitterness toward God, now is the time to address it. Humble yourself, have courage, trust that He loves you, and ask Him to teach you. &nbsp; <br /><br />As so aptly expressed by the great prophet Nephi, "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know the mysteries of God, <em>wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers</em><em>.</em>"<a href="/devotionals/patrick-powell#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> Heavenly Father really can help us create a wonderful life as we ask for and follow His counsel. &nbsp; <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Third, understand that the process of becoming like Heavenly Father takes time</em>. It is not going to happen instantly. God is not going to wave a magic wand over your head and resolve all of the problems in your life. Not only would that rob you of your agency and personal development, but it would rob others of their agency and growth. Understand that it takes time and effort to create a life like God's--to think as He thinks, do as He does, and enjoy what He enjoys. While there are many things that He will help us to resolve in our lives straightway, most of the problems in our lives will not be resolved the very day we pray about them. &nbsp; <br /><br />As so beautifully stated by Elder Orson F. Whitney:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude, and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God ... <em>and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven</em>.<a href="/devotionals/patrick-powell#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a></p>
<p>The prophet Joseph Smith expressed it this way: "I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else."<a href="/devotionals/patrick-powell#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Remember, the process of becoming like Heavenly Father takes time. It is not going to happen instantly. It takes time and effort to create a life like His--to think as He thinks, do as He does, and enjoy what He enjoys. &nbsp; <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Fourth, understand that you may have to be patient and just "make do" for a time.</em> You may not get life just the way you want it. Life may not deal you the cards that you like. (Believe me, I know this.) Understand that you may have to just cope with the problem before you and progress as best you can. Remember, the test of life is not in what cards you have in your hand but how you play the hand that you've been given. Work with the problem at hand, ask for the help and inspiration of heaven, do the very best you can, and move forward. &nbsp; <br /><br />Reflect again on the words of a hymn, this one titled "Though Deepening Trials," with text written by Eliza R. Snow: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Though deepening trials throng your way, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Press on, press on, ye Saints of God! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ere long the resurrection day, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Will spread its life and truth abroad, &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Though outward ills await us here, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The time, at longest, is not long &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ere Jesus Christ will reappear, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Surrounded by a glorious throng, &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Lift up your hearts in praise to God; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Let your rejoicings never cease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Though tribulations rage abroad, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Christ says, "In me ye shall have peace."<a href="/devotionals/patrick-powell#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a></p>
<p><em>Fifth, understand that trials can, if we allow them to, help us develop and feel compassion, love, and joy</em>. Don't bemoan the challenges of mortality. There is so much that can be gained by experiencing challenges, solving problems, and facing opposition. One of my favorite quotes regarding this idea comes from President Brigham Young. It reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There is not, has not been, and never can be any method, scheme, or plan devised by any being in this world for intelligence to exist eternally and obtain an exaltation, without knowing the good and the evil--without tasting the bitter and the sweet.</em> Can the people understand that it is actually necessary for opposite principles to be placed before them, or this state of being would be no probation, and we should have no opportunity for exercising the agency given us? Can they understand that we cannot obtain eternal life unless we actually know and comprehend by our experience the principle of good and the principle of evil, the light and the darkness, truth, virtue, and holiness--also vice, wickedness, and corruption? <em>We must discern and acknowledge that the provinces of the Lord are over all the works of his hands--that when he produces intelligent beings he watches over them for their good. He has given human beings an intelligence designed to become eternal, self-existent, independent, and as Godlike as any being in the heavens.</em> &nbsp; <em><br /></em><em>To answer such design, we are given our agency--the control of our belief, and must know the darkness from the light and the light from the darkness, and must taste the bitter as well as the sweet.<a href="/devotionals/patrick-powell#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><strong>[8]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>The stretching and often painful experiences of mortality can be such a tremendous blessing in our lives. They can help us grow and develop. They can expand us and enlarge our capacity to feel the sweet feelings of love. They give us the opportunity to feel the love and compassion of our Father in Heaven and to develop a meaningful relationship with Him. And they give us the opportunity to reach out and love and serve our fellow brothers and sisters on this earth. Ultimately, trials give us an opportunity to express and have expressed to us the sweet feelings of love, compassion, and connectedness for which we truly long. &nbsp; <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Last, understand that Heavenly Father is there to assist you, to comfort you, and to love you</em>. Please know that He <em>is</em> there. Just because your problems aren't resolved instantly--or you don't get help in the way <em>you</em> think you should--does not mean that He is not there and not helping you. Also, understand that His assistance may come to you in a variety of ways. Don't expect an angel (in the traditional sense) to answer all of your prayers. Heavenly Father can communicate with you and assist you in more ways than that. Assistance from Him may come in the form of a book or an article that you feel prompted to read. It may come in the form of a hymn. It may come in the form of a miraculously coordinated event in your life, where things seem to be guided by heaven itself. It may come in the form of a thought placed in your mind by the Holy Ghost--the Liahona in your head. &nbsp; <br /><br />Understand too that oftentimes God's assistance will come to us in the form of another person, another one of His earthly children, our fellow brothers and sisters (e.g., through a spouse, son or daughter, daughter-in-law, bishop, friend, neighbor, co-worker, medical doctor, or a licensed counselor). As so beautifully stated by President Spencer W. Kimball: "God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs."<a href="/devotionals/patrick-powell#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> Regardless of the way he communicates with you and assists you, please don't overlook the help He sends that is right before your eyes. <em>&nbsp;</em> <em><br /></em><em><br /></em><em>Heavenly Father loves you. Please know that Heavenly Father loves you. </em> &nbsp; <br /><br />In the immortal words of Robert Keen:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />For I am thy God and will still give thee aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Upheld by my righteous, ... omnipotent hand.<a href="/devotionals/patrick-powell#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a></p>
<p>In closing, may I say my greatest desire is to further Father in Heaven's purposes on this earth. In this ideological war being waged in mortality (having continued from premortality), I proclaim my allegiance to <em>Him</em><em>.</em> I am on <em>His</em> side. I choose to view things thru <em>His</em> eyes, not the eyes of men's philosophies--as helpful and inspired as some of them may be. I trust Heavenly Father. He has been so good to me, even among my many trials. He has been so loving, such a true friend. I may never be able to repay Him for His goodness, but I will never cease in honoring and loving Him for the blessings that He has given me. &nbsp; <br /><br />I have learned, in a very personal way, that Heavenly Father lives and loves us. Please believe--listen to the whisperings of the Spirit to your soul at this very moment--that Heavenly Father knows you and loves you. He is aware of your life and your challenges. Let me say that again. Listen to the whisperings of the Spirit to your soul. Heavenly Father knows you and loves you. He is aware of your life and your challenges. Furthermore, He is there for you, as your friend and guide, to walk beside you and help you to face and overcome the challenges of mortality. &nbsp; <br /><br />I conclude with the words of the hymn "Be Still, My Soul," which we will be singing for the closing hymn. Please notice how the Lord reassures His children that He is there to help and assist them: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Be still, my soul: The Lord is on thy side; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />With patience bear thy cross of grief or pain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Leave to thy God to order and provide; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />In every change he faithful will remain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Be still, my soul: Thy best, thy heavenly Friend &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Be still, my soul: Thy God doth undertake &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />To guide the future as he has the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All now mysterious shall be bright at last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Be still, my soul: The waves and winds still know &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />His voice who ruled them while he dwelt below. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Be still, my soul: The hour is hastening on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />When we shall be forever with the Lord, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Be still, my soul: When change and tears are past, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.<a href="/devotionals/patrick-powell#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, be still. Truly, the Lord is on your side. I bear my testimony that Heavenly Father lives and that His gospel is true. In the sacred and holy name of His Son, Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Second Counselor, Young Men General Presidency</p>
<p>M. Joseph Brough was sustained as the second counselor in the Young Men general presidency on April 4, 2015. Previously, he has served as president of the Guatemala Guatemala City Central Mission, ward Young Men president, bishop, bishop's counselor, and high councilor.<br /><br /> He received a bachelor of arts in finance and a master of business administration from the University of Utah. He is a business owner in Brigham City, Utah. He is married to Emily Jane Thompson Brough, and they are the parents of four children.</p>
<p><br />I am excited to be with you this wonderful afternoon. I am excited to be accompanied by my wonderful bride. When I was 17 years old, my family was returning from a mission in Minnesota, where my father and mother had presided. I returned about a month earlier than my parents, along with my younger sister. Some of you know how annoying a younger sister can be, and she was no exception.<br /><br />My sister and I decided to attend the ward that our family would reside in upon their return. So, on the Sabbath, my sister and I joined the congregation in the old Kaysville Utah Tabernacle. In that building, you can enter in the front, by the stand where the speakers and presiding authorities sit. I was sitting toward the back of the congregation when the most beautiful creature I had ever seen entered the front of the chapel. I leaned over to my sister and said something like, "See that girl? I am going to go out with her someday."&nbsp;<br /><br />To which my sister replied, "You? She is out of your league."&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, 36 years after seeing her for the first time, she is still out of my league, but she is my eternal companion. In the fall of 2011, as a new mission president and wife, we were excited to be out among our missionaries. We decided to do apartment inspections and visit every pair of missionaries in the mission.&nbsp;<br /><br />As we traveled from Guatemala City to one of our more remote zones, known as Solol&aacute;, we learned that a demonstration was blocking the road in front of us. Demonstrations in Guatemala can take hours, and there is usually no way to get past them. But when we began to inquire about a possible alternative road, we were told of another route. The route, however, came with the following warnings:</p>
<p>Like any zealous new mission president and wife, on we went. After driving a while, we came to a spot on a dirt road that looked like a very steep drop-off into a wash. My beautiful wife joked that we should get the camera out and take pictures as we went over the edge.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, years earlier I had been a young missionary in Guatemala and had learned that a small branch dragged across the road meant "proceed with caution." It might even mean "stop." I saw the branch but failed, at the time, to register what it meant.</p>
<p><img alt="Car hanging on the edge of drop off" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Car-hanging-on-edge_300x225.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>In the next moment, we found ourselves dangling off a 20-foot ledge where a bridge had washed out. I managed to climb out my side, but my wife could not open her door. When she made a move to try and climb over the seat and come out my door, the vehicle began to rock. Obviously, it was a very concerning moment. Many thoughts ran through my mind. I could see the headlines: "New Mission President Drove over Embankment Where There Was No Bridge, Resulting in Severe Injury to Wife" or "New Mission President and Wife Missing; They Were Robbed on a Road on Which They Should Not Have Been Traveling."&nbsp;<br /><br />Not knowing what to do, I paused outside the vehicle and pleaded with Heavenly Father, "Please help me in my moment of carelessness." Well, can you believe that a large banana truck suddenly pulled out onto the road from behind us? The driver and passengers saw us and came over to laugh and enjoy the predicament of the silly gringo. They pointed out the branch on the road. Literally, it was just a little twig.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then, to our miraculous blessing, they retrieved from their truck the only chain that I saw in three years of service in Guatemala. They pulled us out and paused to take this picture.</p>
<p>Before they left, they cut down a tree and pulled it across the road. I think they wanted to make sure that the next gringo to come by did not make the same mistake.</p>
<p><img alt="Picture with Banana Farmers" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture-with-Banana-Farmers_300x225.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />At that point in time, we did what any other new mission president would do: We proceeded like nothing had happened. I am sure that a couple of the General Authorities to whom I reported will hear this talk and say, "What? We never heard about that."&nbsp;<br /><br />Wonderful young people attending BYU-Idaho, I tell you this story to make the point that we must heed warnings,&nbsp;promptings,&nbsp;and direction given us by the voice of the Lord--no matter how strong or mild. That voice comes in many forms: scriptures, commandments, whisperings from the Holy Ghost, the words of the living prophets, parents (especially mothers), Church leaders, and good friends. Are we listening for and heeding these promptings and warnings? Why is it important to do so? We read in Proverbs:Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&nbsp;<br />Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>We must trust the Lord with all of our heart. We must understand that our knowledge falls short of what is best for us and best for others. If we do trust in Him, what a wonderful promise He bestows: He will direct our paths.</p>
<p>We have great examples of His willingness to direct our paths throughout the scriptures. Think for a moment of the wonderful example of Nephi. To start with, he and his brothers were given a commandment through their father to return to Jerusalem and obtain the brass plates.<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a><br /><br />When&nbsp;leaning&nbsp;to their own understanding, they came up with the bright idea of casting lots and then sending someone to go up to the house of Laban to just ask for the plates of brass. We all know how well that went for Laman. In the end, not such a good idea.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then the brothers deliberated on the problem and came up with a well-thought-out plan. With their exceedingly great possessions, they decided to try and buy the plates of brass. Now, by all worldly standards, that was a very good plan. Yet the results were no better than the previous attempt.<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a><br /><br />After taking a beating from his brothers, seeing an angel, and having another disagreement,&nbsp;Nephi at last&nbsp;leaned not to his own understanding. He trusted in the Lord, saying, "And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do."<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a><br /><br />In our family, we have a saying that became an important part of our mission, as my wife and I were privileged to lead the missionaries of the Guatemala Guatemala City Central Mission. Now, it is not original to us, because President Russell M. Nelson has been teaching the concept for a while. President Nelson said it this way:&nbsp;<br />"Obedience brings success; exact obedience brings miracles."<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a><br /><br />Our family and mission version is "Obedience brings blessings,&nbsp;<em>but</em>&nbsp;exact obedience brings miracles."&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most enjoyable experiences that I have had is to hold&nbsp;a first&nbsp;interview with a new missionary. You returned missionaries remember that interview. You were scared to death. As a mission president, I cherished that moment because you were very moldable.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would have the missionary sit down, and then I would pull my chair up close to the missionary so that my knees were almost touching his or her knees. Then I would look right in the missionary's eyes and say something like this: "Elder or Sister, there are many things that this mission may be struggling to understand and become, but there is one thing we do and will continue to do well." I would continue, "Obedience brings blessings, but exact obedience brings miracles, and in this&nbsp;mission&nbsp;we are not looking for blessings. Elder or Sister, will you help us have miracles?"&nbsp;<br /><br />You know what, I never had a missionary say no. What a wonderful commitment! For the rest of their missions, we could always remind them that they had promised to help us have miracles, and we&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;have miracles.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am sure that I do not completely understand what exact obedience means, but here is what I have come to understand. It is not perfect obedience; that is impossible. Hence, repentance must be a key part of exact obedience.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the scriptures, we have great examples of exact obedience. In fact, one of the greatest stories is&nbsp;of&nbsp;a group of 2,060 young men who were exactly obedient. We learn of them: "Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto&nbsp;them; and&nbsp;I did remember the words which they said unto me that their mothers had taught them."<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn6" title="">[vi]</a></p>
<p><img alt="Battle graphic 1" height="165" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Battle%20Graphic%201_300x165.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>As you recall, the stripling warriors were in a very precarious situation when Helaman recorded this scripture. They were in a battle in which the remaining part of the army was giving way. In other words, they were retreating!</p>
<p><img alt="Battle graphic 2" height="175" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Battle%20Graphic%202_200x175.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>To me, this means that&nbsp;initially&nbsp;the army resembled a line or arc in fighting the enemy, but as the rest of the army began giving way, the stripling warriors were forced to defend themselves, their line becoming the shape of a peninsula. They were forced to spread out in defense.&nbsp;<br /><br />I imagine Helaman giving a command like "You, 200 young men, move to our left flank and force those Lamanites trying to cut us off from the remaining army to turn back." Again, I know they were not perfect, but they were exact. Imagine that in performing this task, they realized that they had gone to the left 100 yards too far. What did they do? Did they sit down and worry because they were not perfect? Did they give up because they had failed? Did they stop and deliberate together to determine what they should do next? No, they immediately corrected their action.&nbsp;<br /><br />This mental picture has helped me come to understand that exact obedience means as I make a mistake or commit a sin, the speed at which I start the repentance process is important. I need to immediately repent. I must use the repentance process whether my mistakes are large or small. And I must respond immediately.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the most recent general conference, Brother Stephen W. Owen stated, "True repentance inspires us to make our obedience a commitment--a covenant."<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a>&nbsp;We need that inspiration! May we all commit to repent, drawing upon the sacrifice of the Savior with a more-frequent and quicker response.&nbsp;<br /><br />Exact obedience also requires a commitment to all the warnings and promptings and commandments that Heavenly Father gives us. They come from many sources, as I mentioned earlier. With regard to these young men, one of the greatest sources of warnings and commandments was their righteous mothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />President Gordon B. Hinckley, when speaking of the temptations and challenges that face young people of your age, stated, "I know of no better answer to these foul practices that confront our young people than the teachings of a mother, given in love with an unmistakable warning."<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[viii]</a><br /><br />Get accustomed to it, young people; righteous mothers will be giving you warnings for the rest of your life. Just before my father was sustained as a General Authority, in 1988, he was excited to tell his mother about the upcoming calling. Of course, he anticipated that she would be excited for the call and even, as the mother of a new General Authority, a little proud. Can you imagine my father's surprise when the first words out of her mouth were "Don't you dare embarrass the prophet!"&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes we will be likewise surprised; we will not understand why Heavenly Father asks specific things from us. Those can be some of the toughest times to be exactly obedient. Remember the account of when Adam, one of the greatest of all, was asked why he gave sacrifice: "And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me."<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[ix]</a><br /><br />My wife has been a wonderful example of exact obedience even when she has not understood. During the October 2000 general conference, my wife heard the counsel from President Gordon B. Hinckley that "we discourage tattoos and also 'the piercing of the body for other than medical purposes.' We do not, however, take any&nbsp;positon&nbsp;'on the minimal piercing of the ears by women for one pair of earrings--one pair."<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[x]</a>&nbsp;When my wife arrived home, our second daughter remembers her mom explaining to her the importance of following the prophets no matter what. As she talked, my wife also acted. She took out her second pair of earrings for the last time. I believe she still does not understand why, but I know that why does not matter to her.&nbsp;<br /><br />To some of us, that may seem insignificant because it is such a small thing. That is true. However, I do not remember the Savior saying, "If ye love me, keep the commandments that appear important."&nbsp;<br /><br />My dear brothers and sisters, there is one clear voice of warning that we must always heed. That voice comes from the Lord's chosen apostles and prophets. It might not be popular by the world's standards, just like that small thing requested by President Hinckley, but you can--no, you must--trust that it comes from Heavenly Father. It might be only a small twig or a whole tree that they are dragging across the road. I exhort you to read the conference that just occurred with the thought in mind of, What twigs did the Lord place in my path? To me, the reaffirmation of the family proclamation was absolutely needed and clearly placed in your and my path once again.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, some of you may be thinking, "Well, that is great. But what do you do when you are seeking promptings, counsel from the Lord, warnings, and direction, and you just do not seem to receive an answer?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe you are having this concern with regard to the most important decision you will make in your life. Remember the promise to trust in the Lord with all thine heart and He will direct thy paths.&nbsp;<br /><br />On important events in our lives, we do want clear direction, and that may be hard to find. When I was courting my wonderful bride, I wanted a clear manifestation of the Spirit that she was the right one. It would have been nice to have an angel come down and declare that to me. What I knew for certain was that I was definitely in love. I could not stand to go more than about 18 hours without seeing her.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I did all the things outlined: I fasted, I prayed, I attended the temple, and I sought the counsel of my parents. Now, before I continue, I want to add that I believe I was raised by the greatest father that has ever walked the face of the earth. However, he could not confirm that my wife was the right one for me. I had had such a great relationship with my father that I just assumed he would help me with that most important of decisions. But he could not tell me that he had had confirmation by the Spirit. My mother, thankfully, was more helpful. She expressed that she felt good about Emily. My mother's feelings allowed me to move forward to do what was right.&nbsp;<br /><br />Logic also played a very valuable role in the process of making a decision. I knew that Emily possessed an unusually strong commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ. What the Lord wanted was going to come first in her life--no matter what. She was extremely kind. She was intelligent, and as we spoke about scripture study, prayer, family home evening, Church service, and many other topics, it was evident that she was founded&nbsp;in&nbsp;true principles.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, with those assurances, on a wonderful day in April 1985, my eternal companion and I started a never-ending journey. She is the single best decision that I have ever made. Heavenly Father was definitely directing my path. That does not mean that life has been simple and without challenges. But it has been a unique journey that we have shared together. I look forward to spending another 50 billion years with her! Maybe then she will not be a mystery to me. On second thought, it will be okay if she still is a bit of a mystery.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have had such strong answers to many prayers, so why not an unmistakable answer to the most important of all requests that I had made to the Lord up to that point in my life? I believe it was to teach me to listen to the still, small voice and&nbsp;not&nbsp;doubt. Furthermore, I have come to understand that if I am repentant, being exactly obedient, following my leaders, and making other good choices--in other words, if I am worthy--Heavenly Father will not let me make big mistakes without proper warning. Nor will He let you.&nbsp;<br /><br />In December 1996, my wife was close to the end of her pregnancy with our last child. It was a Sunday, and my bride requested that I give her a blessing. She was concerned with the well-being of our unborn child.&nbsp;<br /><br />For some reason--and, brethren, do not make this mistake--I took her request lightly, thinking that she was just overreacting. She was so close to having the baby that everything was sure to be just fine. I predetermined what "I" was going to say&nbsp;in&nbsp;the blessing, instead of remembering that we need always to seek those warnings, promptings, and revelations that Heavenly Father wants us to pronounce when we have the privilege to exercise His priesthood. We never give a blessing. It comes from Him.&nbsp;<br /><br />After visiting with family that Sabbath afternoon, we retired to our little apartment in Logan, Utah, and tucked our three children into bed. We then prepared for the blessing. I placed my hands upon her head and closed my eyes, and then the most incredible thing happened. I could not remember what I was doing. I opened my eyes and could see my beautiful bride sitting in the chair with her head bowed, waiting. I remembered that I was giving her a blessing and began once again. I placed my hands on her head and started over, when, to my surprise, the very same thing happened. I went completely blank. I could not remember what I was doing. I then sat down by my bride and said something like "You are right, my dear; something is wrong."&nbsp;<br /><br />What I was experiencing can be described only with the Lord's words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it&nbsp;be&nbsp;right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.&nbsp;<br />But if it&nbsp;be&nbsp;not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong.<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[xi]</a></p>
<p>I have never experienced a stupor of thought even remotely as strong since that cold day in December 1996. Heavenly Father taught me in such a powerful way and prevented me from making a mistake from which I might not have been able to recover. After that experience, I have become much more sensitive to "if it&nbsp;be&nbsp;not right you shall have no such feelings."</p>
<p>The remaining portion of the story is sacred and does not apply to this subject today. Let me just conclude the story by saying that we immediately called my wife's doctor, who is a wonderful priesthood man. When we told him what had happened, he explained that he had felt anxious the last time she was in the office, but with no evidence as to why. Now he felt that we should leave immediately for the hospital, and he would be there to start labor as soon as we arrived. About 48 hours later, and after several very crucial moments, our beautiful youngest daughter was born.&nbsp;<br /><br />My young friends, Heavenly Father is here to keep us from making very costly mistakes if we are seeking His warnings, promptings, and revelations from all available sources--and if we heed and act upon them. We have the right to have the Holy Ghost always be with us, especially in crucial moments of life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Life is not a fairytale, but I believe that, as we end this life, everyone can experience the words "And they lived happily ever after." Let me explain.&nbsp;<br /><br />To do so, let us look for a moment at the life of Job. His experience is absolute proof that life can be very difficult even when one is being exactly obedient. Often I have thought, "Why would the Lord require so much of one man who was so committed to doing what was right?"&nbsp;<br /><br />Then one time when I was experiencing a little affliction, little especially when compared to that of Job or Joseph Smith. I read these words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.&nbsp;<br />Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.&nbsp;<br />Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither&nbsp;charge&nbsp;thee with transgression, as they did Job."<a href="/devotionals/brother-m-joseph-brough#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[xii]</a></p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, the Lord required so much of Job so that the Lord could teach you and me and Joseph Smith that we are not yet as Job. And giving us that perspective, He could remind us that if we endure our small affliction well, God shall exalt us.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brothers and sisters, that you will successfully identify the warning twigs and trees that Heavenly Father places in your path is my hope for each and every one of you.&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify that as we heed the voice of the Lord, as we receive it from its many sources and strive to be exactly obedient, we can have a life that ends with "And they lived happily ever after." That can happen only by living the doctrine of Christ and making and keeping sacred covenants. Of&nbsp;this&nbsp;I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Pre-devotional Discussion:&nbsp;</strong>Other than the temple, church, or home, write a few sentences on the <a href="https://byui.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/323102/viewContent/4632620/View">discussion board</a> describing a place where you have made a heavenly, spiritual connection.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I would like to share with you today some thoughts about the importance of making spiritual connections and places where we can make connections with the Supreme Creator--He who made all things.<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> <br /><br />The title of my talk--"Heavenly Connections"--is a phrase used by Elder Neil L. Andersen in a talk titled "Overcoming the World." Elder Andersen notes that one aspect of "overcoming the world is being less concerned with our online connections and more concerned with our heavenly connection to God."<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />1. Heavenly connections in spiritual places &nbsp; <br /><br />I will begin with heavenly connections in spiritual places--more specifically, in the sublime environment of the fulness of nature. In Moses we read, <em>"For I, the Lord God, created all things ... spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth."<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><strong>[3]</strong></a></em><sup> </sup>We sense the Spirit of the Lord in the grandeur of nature.</p>

Two weeks later, my mother bundled up me and my two older sisters, and we joined my father in Zion National Park, in picturesque southern Utah.</p>
<p><img alt="Parents in graduation robes" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture3.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />My parents worked at Zion for a total of about 10 summers. My father eventually became the manager of Zion Lodge for six years, and my mother was postmistress of the tiny US post office inside the lodge. My parents graduated together from BYU in 1949--the first in both their families to gain a college education. Subsequently, my father completed an MBA at the University of Utah in 1959. That same year, twin girls joined our family. Yes--five girls, all girls. Our parents lived the gospel and taught us, by example, of their love and dedication to the Lord, each other, and our family.</p>
<p><img alt="mountain stream with snow caped mountain in background" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture4.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />Our young family moved and traveled often, living in seven states during those formative years. We developed a deep gratitude, sense of wonder, and awe for the handiwork of the Great Creator. &nbsp; <br /><br />Many thoughtful comments were posted on the discussion board for this devotional. Precious Msongweni, a BYU-Idaho online student in Pretoria, South Africa, shared the following: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are so many&nbsp;places where I have made spiritual connections. One ... is when my family and I visited my husband's grandparents' home in Swaziland, South Africa.</p>
<p><img alt="Arial view of Swaziland Africa" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture5.jpg" width="467" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Swaziland is a rural place unharmed by the harsh changes of the environment. There are beautiful&nbsp;mountains, hills, and valleys.</p>
<p><img alt="Stars in the sky" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture6.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />One night, my eldest daughter and I were admiring the stars. The Milky Way was so clear and felt very close to us. We started admiring the Creation, and a thought came to my mind about a star that shined 2,000 years ago all over the world, declaring the good tidings of the newborn Savior.<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a></p>
<p><img alt="Images of Nature" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture7.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />The first verse of the hymn "How Great Thou Art" begins with these words: "O Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder consider all the worlds Thy hands have made...."<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />"Awesome wonder" vocalizes our feelings of overwhelming inadequacy and reverence in these inspiring places. As Alma expressed to Korihor, God's creations bear "witness" of His existence, His power, and His love for us.<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a></p>
<p><img alt="Student in the Spori Art Gallery " height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture8.jpg" width="467" /></p>
<p>I'm certain many of you were captivated by President Henry B. Eyring's small sketch books beautifully displayed in the recent art exhibit--"A Visual Journal"--in the Spori Art Gallery. The sketches were marvelous and expressive, but a few simple written words drew my attention. "Divine Design" was penned and underlined at the top of one small page, and below were the words "There should be a sense of awe." &nbsp; <br /><br />BYU president Kevin J. Worthen, during commencement exercises at BYU in April of this year, likewise expressed the importance of awe. In fact, he surprisingly counseled the graduates to "be awful"! He noted the original meaning of the word "awful" was "awe-inspiring," "worthy of respect," and "profoundly respectful or reverential."<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a></p>

<p>We can connect with heaven when we are "awe"-ful and truly reverence the divine design of our Creator. &nbsp; <br /><br />Another online student, Shauneen Washburn from Tucson, Arizona, shared the following on the devotional discussion board: "<a title="When I am out enjoying the magnificence of nature...">When I am out enjoying the magnificence of nature </a>... I feel close to God. The Spirit testifies to me that God is the Creator and that He has a plan for His children.... In the vastness of the endless ocean or the silence of the snow-covered mountains, or driving ... through the desert, I am in awe of His power and majesty. I constantly have a prayer in my heart, and my heart feels full when I am part of nature."<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a></p>
<p><img alt="Images of Nature" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture10.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />We can be distracted from making those spiritual connections if we, or others, fail to respect and care for God's creations. This concept was expressed in an <em>Ensign</em> article by Mark J. Nielsen: "The earth was ... created for us and given into our care.... Since it is God who entrusted it to us, it is to Him we shall answer for what we choose to do.... All of our actions can display respect for the creations of God."<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a></p>
<p><img alt="Bridge in the woods" height="225" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture11.jpg" width="400" /><br /><br />My wonderful neighbor and visiting teacher shared the following experience with me: She and a long-time friend exercise daily by walking together early in the morning.</p>
<p><img alt="Nature Path" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture12.jpg" width="467" /> <br /><br />In the summer, they enjoy the beauty of a well-developed local nature trail--the Teton River Trail--that wanders pleasantly alongside the river.</p>
<p><img alt="Trash on path" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture13.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />At one point, they observed that their enjoyment of the trail was fading as the litter along the path was increasing. Their initial reaction was to question why the offenders wouldn't pick up their own trash. Their second reaction was "We ought to do something about this!"</p>
<p><img alt="Pile of trash on the ground" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture14.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />They began to bring grocery bags on their morning walks and filled the bags with trash as they walked.</p>
<p><img alt="Bag of garbage" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture15.jpg" width="467" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Eventually, they brought large trash bags with them to finish the task. Their pleasure and enjoyment of the beautiful trail resumed, as did the spiritual nature of the trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Last year, the National Park Service celebrated their 100th year of safeguarding some of our "nation's most treasured landscapes."<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a></p>
<p><img alt="Zion National Park" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture16.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />Likewise, our charge from the Lord is to safeguard His beautiful creations by showing reverence and awe for the divinity of nature.</p>
<p><img alt="Child playing by a stream and on a bridge" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture17.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />Perhaps simply gathering trash will allow us, and others, to more easily connect with heaven. &nbsp; <br /><br />2. Heavenly connections in sacred places (This will become a list of four items as the talk progresses) &nbsp; <br /><br />Last December, my husband and I enjoyed a unique travel experience to Morocco with good friends.</p>
<p><img alt="Morocco Market " height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture18.jpg" width="467" /></p>
<p>In the midst of the colorful, chaotic medina (or old market) in Marrakech--complete with snake charmers!--were unique sacred places. One of the most memorable was a former theological college--Ali Ben Youssef Medersa. It was the largest and one of the most beautiful schools in North Africa.</p>
<p><img alt="Floor mat " height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture19.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />As many as 900 students from Muslim countries all over the world studied the Koran there. The inscription over the unassuming entryway reads, "You who enter my door, may your highest hopes be exceeded."<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />After traveling from the entrance through a long, narrow corridor, a magnificent view of the interior courtyard is suddenly revealed.</p>
<p><img alt="Ali Ben Youssef Medersa hall" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture20.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />All those entering the courtyard literally gasp in wonder and awe. This spectacular space was richly decorated in the 16th century with carved cedar, plasterwork, marble, and geometric tile patterns.</p>
<p><img alt="Ali Ben Youssef Medersa" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture21.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />The symmetry and repetition of intricate surface patterns is characteristic of Islamic design.</p>

<p><img alt="Mosque" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture24.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />Similarly, our temples are sacred spaces dedicated to worshipping the Lord.</p>
<p><img alt="Rexburg Temple" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture25.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />Additional dedicated sacred spaces include our meetinghouses, our campus buildings and grounds, our classroom spaces,&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Images of sacred places" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture26.jpg" width="467" /></p>
<p>and our homes in a wide variety of forms.</p>
<p><img alt="Images of homes" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture27.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />Elder David A. Bednar reminded us in his recent general conference talk of the sacred roles of the Sabbath day, the holy temple, and our homes in helping us to remember our "spiritual priorities":</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One of the great challenges each of us faces every day is to not allow the concerns of this world to so dominate our time and energy that we neglect the eternal things that matter most....<sup> </sup> &nbsp; <br /><br />The Sabbath is God's time, a&nbsp;<em>sacred time</em>&nbsp;specifically set apart for worshipping Him and for receiving and remembering His great and precious promises.... &nbsp; <br /><br />A temple literally is the house of the Lord, a&nbsp;<em>sacred space</em>&nbsp;specifically set apart for worshipping God and for receiving and remembering His great and precious promises.... &nbsp; <br /><br />Importantly, a home should be the ultimate combination of&nbsp;<em>time and space</em>&nbsp;wherein individuals and families remember most effectively God's great and precious promises. Leaving our homes to spend time in Sunday meetings and to enter the sacred space of a temple is vital but insufficient. Only as we bring the spirit and strength derived from those holy activities back with us into our homes can we sustain our focus upon the great purposes of mortal life and overcome the corruption that is in the world.<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;Temple attendance helps us to clear our minds and connect with the Spirit. Elder Boyd K. Packer teaches us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the temple we can receive spiritual perspective. There, during the time of the temple service, we are "out of the world." ... &nbsp; <br /><br />Sometimes our minds are so beset with problems, and there are so many things clamoring for attention at once, that we just cannot think clearly and see clearly. At the temple the dust of distraction seems to settle out, the fog and the haze seem to lift, and we can "see" things that we were not able to see before and find a way through our troubles that we had not previously known.<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a></p>
<p>3. Heavenly connections in unexpected places &nbsp; <br /><br />Sometimes heavenly connections can be made in places that may not seem to be either spiritual or sacred. The following portion of my father's history will illustrate this concept. <br /><br />My father graduated from high school in the midst of WWII. He wanted to enlist in the navy, but he needed to have a hernia operation first. While he was in the hospital recovering from the surgery, someone left a pamphlet about BYU on his bedside table.</p>
<p><img alt="BYU Pamphlet" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture28.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />My father recorded: "It said, 'Come to BYU, a friendly school.' I had no idea what I was getting into--but was intrigued by 'a friendly school.' I told my mother that I wanted to go to BYU in Provo, Utah--and she asked what BYU was. I told her it was a Mormon University, and I can still see her face when she looked aghast and said, 'What! You want to go to BYU with those Mormons out there?'" &nbsp; <br /><br />His mother was a staunch Methodist, and he had been raised in that faith. Nonetheless, he attended BYU for one quarter and then enlisted in the navy. 50 years later, at my father's high school reunion, my parents learned that Jeane Berthelson, a high school classmate and friend, was also a nurse's aide at the hospital who listened to the Spirit and left the pamphlet in his room. &nbsp; <br /><br />During the war, my father was assigned to serve on LSM (Landing Ship Medium) #389 when they landed in Guam. He was a quartermaster second class. Their ship sailed from the east coast of the US through the Panama Canal, picked up munitions and tanks in California, and headed out to the Pacific to deliver them to the Marines.</p>
<p><img alt="Marine on a ship standing next to large guns" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture29.jpg" width="467" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In my father's words: &nbsp; <br /><br />I remember when we pulled into the harbor ... on Guam. It was a Sunday morning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="Guam military base" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture30.jpg" width="467" /> <br /><br />I looked down the beach and there were some huge quonset huts there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="Guam military base" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture31.jpg" width="467" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They used them as quarters for service men. I saw six sailors going into a quonset hut. They were in their dress whites. I thought: Gosh, in their dress whites? They should be in their standard uniforms. So, I asked the captain: "What do you think those guys are doing?" He said: "They are going to church." I said: "Well, who are they?" He said: "They are a small group of Mormons running their own church; they don't have a chaplain." I found that interesting, so I said: "Captain, could I have a leave to go ashore and join those six guys?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I shaved and decided to go over to the beach and see what was going on. There were six elders having their own little church meeting, so I joined them and I felt at home. That was the second time I had rubbed shoulders with the Mormons other than [at] BYU. &nbsp; <br /><br />We all corresponded for years.... I think things were planned very carefully that I would end up in the Mormon Church.... That's my story ... just at the right [place] in the right moment.</p>
<p>Elder Ronald A. Rasband spoke about coincidence versus "divine design" in his recent general conference address. He quoted Elder Neal A. Maxwell, who explained, "<em>Coincidence</em> is not an appropriate word to describe the workings of an omniscient God. He does not do things by 'coincidence' but ... by 'divine design.'"<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Rasband continues: "Our lives are like a chessboard, and the Lord moves us from one place to another--if we are responsive to spiritual promptings. Looking back, we can see His hand in our lives."'<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />I don't believe it was by coincidence that a pamphlet was left in my father's hospital room. I don't believe it was by coincidence that he arrived on Guam on a Sunday morning and saw six sailors dressed in whites on the beach. I also don't believe it was by coincidence that, following WWII, my father met my mother at BYU in a history class because they were seated alphabetically (my mother's maiden name is Hale, and my father's last name is Hansen). God was in the details; heavenly connections were made in the most unexpected places. &nbsp; <br /><br />4. Heavenly connections matter more than online connections &nbsp; <br /><br />If our desire is to connect with the Spirit of the Lord, we need to be present--we need to be focused and not distracted. Allow me to share two brief stories that illustrate this final point. &nbsp; <br /><br />The first account is by Lynette Hendricks--a great friend and my other visiting teacher:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My first visit to the Sacred Grove was an incredible spiritual experience--absolutely everything I had hoped it would be! My husband wasn't able to be with me on that particular trip, so we saved our money and planned a short vacation to New York specifically to visit the Sacred Grove. &nbsp; <br /><br />I was particularly excited the morning my husband and I would visit the grove together. I had looked forward to sharing this special place. The Spirit is strong there; you can feel it. I just knew he wouldn't be disappointed! &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />We entered the grove on a hot, humid day, and the cool shade from the trees overhead offered immediate relief.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="Sacred Grove " height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture32.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />I could feel the sweet wash of the Spirit that I had so counted on. We found one of the benches strategically placed along the pathways inside the grove and sat down to soak it all in--but it was not to last for long.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="Bench in the Sacred Grove " height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture33.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />We had been followed into the grove that morning by another tourist. As he walked past us, his phone rang rather loudly. He answered and launched into conducting a lengthy business conversation over his phone. We moved to a different location, but it was to no avail. His voice carried well and followed us all over the grove. I hoped he would finish so that the peace of the place could return, but he did not.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="path in the Sacred Grove " height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture34.jpg" width="467" /><br /><br />Sometimes there is no way to mask or soften or make right an interruption on a sacred moment. We left the grove, his phone conversation following us.<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a></p>
<p>The second story is an experience I had a few months ago while I was serving in the temple. I was in the women's dressing room when a significant distraction occurred: a phone left in one of the lockers began to ring without relief. Patrons entered and exited the room with bewildered expressions and comments regarding the persistent phone noise. The "world" had entered the sacredness of that holy space and had distracted everyone within its audible reach. The world had entered the temple, and the Spirit had exited. When the phone was finally reached and silenced, the source of the distraction was discovered. The irony was clear: The insistent ring was a daily reminder to read the scriptures.<em></em> &nbsp; <br /><br />Do we spend too much time connecting online and too little time connecting with heaven? Is it time to consider regularly disconnecting with technology in order to reconnect with heaven?</p>
<p><img alt="Child sitting on a grassing hill overlooking a small valley" height="263" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture35.jpg" width="467" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ryan Holmes addressed this problem in a BYU Devotional: "In today's connected world we are constantly interrupted by buzzing, beeping, and ringing notifications that we assume require an immediate reaction." Brother Holmes defines this as "[h]yper attention to digital noise."<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Bonnie L. Oscarson echoed this description in her recent general conference address: "We live in a culture where more and more we are focused on the small, little screen in our hands than we are on the people around us. We have substituted texting and tweeting for actually looking someone in the eye and smiling or, even rarer, having a face-to-face conversation."<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Brother Holmes recommends the following to counteract this distraction from the present: "Don't just ingest whatever comes your way via text, email, data feeds, streams, and notifications. Make a conscious choice. You decide what, when, and how you are going to interact digitally.... Don't get trapped in a compulsion loop that keeps you from ... important tasks and people right in front of you."<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />To conclude my talk, please listen carefully to the counsel of Elder M. Russell Ballard in a trio of short video clips from a CES Devotional for Young Adults in which he addresses the topic of online connections.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As an Apostle, I now ask you a question: Do you have any personal quiet time? I have wondered if those who lived in the past had more opportunity than we do now to see, feel, and experience the presence of the Spirit in their lives. &nbsp; <br /><br />Seemingly, as our world gets brighter, louder, and busier, we have a greater challenge feeling the Spirit in our lives. If your life is void of quiet time, would you begin tonight to seek for some? &nbsp; <br /><br />I also worry that some of you check your email, Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram accounts or send text messages during the most important gathering in the restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--our sacred sacrament meeting. In this important meeting we should be focusing on the Lord through praying, singing hymns, and partaking the emblems of His body and blood instead of hooking up to our multimedia devices. You cannot connect to the Spirit during the presentation of the sacrament while looking at or sending a message on your smartphone or your tablet. This connection requires the Light of Christ, settling from your minds into your hearts with burning love and devotion. &nbsp; <br /><br />I invite you to go to the temple. Go as often as you can, and turn off your smartphones and put them away before you enter the temple grounds. &nbsp; <br /><br />In all the ordinances in the house of the Lord, you will hear beautiful language, words, and promises given by the Lord to His children. It is the only place you can hear those beautiful, inspiring words. &nbsp; <br /><br />If&nbsp;you&nbsp;do&nbsp;not&nbsp;qualify&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;temple&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;right&nbsp;now,&nbsp;visit&nbsp;the&nbsp;temple&nbsp;grounds.Let me make a very important point in case you have never heard it before: Nothing prevents you or anyone else from visiting the temple grounds. The Lord wants you to prepare yourself to be worthy of a temple recommend and come to the temple as soon as you can.<a href="/devotionals/wendy-harris#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a></p>
<p>My dear young brothers and sisters, I pray that we will all take the time to consciously and prayerfully consider what matters most. In the sacred name of our Savior Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pre-devotional Discussion:</strong></p>
<p>In preparation for Brother Shawn Johansen's devotional address, consider doing one of the following:</p>
<p>1. Review a spiritual experience that you have recorded in your journal.&nbsp; <br />2. If you have a significant spiritual experience in your life that you have not written down, take the time to record it and preserve the record. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2-3 sentences on the&nbsp;<a href="https://byui.brightspace.com/d2l/le/323102/discussions/topics/631726/View">discussion board</a>, explain why you think the Lord wants us to be historians of our own lives.<br /><br /></p>

<p>It seems appropriate on this Halloween to begin briefly with two nightmares of mine. The first is a recurring nightmare. In this dream, I come to class to start teaching but realize that I haven't adequately prepared. I stand dumb before my students, unable to teach. Today, I'm thankful for my friend the teleprompter. The second nightmare occurred many years ago. In this dream, I found myself in a large auditorium, giving a lecture. This time I was prepared with something important to say, but the audience was not listening. Midway through the lecture, the entire audience began doing the wave back and forth in the auditorium. Needless to say, the lecture did not go well. Today, could I ask you to refrain from doing the wave? I would greatly appreciate it. In return, I promise to use the teleprompter so that neither of these dreams comes true.</p>
<p>I teach in the history department. One occupational hazard of being a historian manifests itself the first time one's child starts learning history in school. Years ago, my oldest daughter, who was in middle school at the time, began taking American History. I was excited because it's my area of emphasis. After a couple weeks, I asked, "How is history going?" Now, as an aside, this was about the same time that she asked me if I remembered when Lincoln was shot. She obviously was in need of this class. So when I asked her about her class, she said, with all the sensitivity of a young teenager, "I hate it. It's boring."</p>
<p>I was thinking, "Well great, it's only what your father does for a living." But instead I asked her, "Why don't you like it?" &nbsp; <br /><br />Her response: "All the teacher does is put up dates and names on the projector." She was surprised when I told her that I would find such a class boring as well. "But isn't that what history is?" she asked. &nbsp; <br /><br />Ah, at last, what I'd been waiting for--my teaching moment. I was able to tell her that the facts of the past--dates, names, places--are important building blocks for the historian, but good history is about much more. It is analytical in nature. Yes, it is important to know the basic fact that World War I came before World War II, but not just because two comes after one. Think about it for a moment. Even if you don't know much about history, you might know that Germany, Britain, and France were key players in each war. Isn't it possible that the tensions of the first bled over into the second? Indeed, we know that the causes of the second are partly found in the first. The humble fact that the number one comes before two leads us to the more-significant and higher thought pattern of a causal relationship. &nbsp; <br /><br />Good historians ask searching questions that encourage understanding of the complexities of the past. They want to know how and why events occur. They seek out answers to that all-important question that we should often ask: "So what?" So what does it mean? So what is important? &nbsp; <br /><br />You might be thinking, "So what does this all have to do with the doctrines of salvation?" Actually, quite a bit. &nbsp; <br /><br />Several of the commandments that the Lord has given us ask us to act like historians. We know, for example, that our church is a record-keeping church. We have invested a great deal in genealogy records that help us carry out the work of turning the hearts of the children to the fathers. &nbsp; <br /><br />And where would we be if we did not keep a historical record of the words of the prophets? The Lord commanded Nephi to obtain the brass plates so that an entire nation would not "dwindle and perish in unbelief."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Without such a record, the Mulekites did just that--they became a people who "denied the being of their Creator."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />And what do we do when we study the scriptures? We ponder records from the past. Indeed, LDS students of the scriptures practice good historical skills, with the intent not to glean the historical details of ancient Israel or the Americas but to understand the deeper meanings in the texts. In the case of the scriptures, effective analysis is a task with eternal significance, for in them we find the doctrines of salvation. &nbsp; <br /><br />All of these are important, but today I'd like to focus on one other way in which Latter-day Saints are encouraged to act like historians--and that is keeping a record of our own past, particularly our spiritual experiences. I did not hear a collective groan just now, but I suspect that many of you probably just became less interested in my subject. But let me try to persuade you of this fact: that the Lord wants us to act as historians of our own lives--in the recording and analyzing. I would also hope to convince you to see the blessings that can come to you if you will do this. I see four arguments for this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping a record of our spiritual experiences can inspire others. <br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping a regular record helps us see God's hand in our lives, and it shows our Heavenly Father that we appreciate His guidance. <br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping a record of our spiritual experiences helps us remember them. <br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping a record helps us be self-evaluative.</p>
<p>Someday most of you will have teenagers--and that's about as scary a Halloween thought as I can give to you today. Anyone who has tried to raise teenagers knows that any help is welcomed. I was very grateful to my mother, who, before she passed away, would occasionally send a note of encouragement to my children. Her purpose was to help them to see their eternal worth. She knew that reminding them of their eternal connections to family could help mitigate the worst that the teenage years threw at them. I testify that the records we keep of our lives can perform this same function--to inspire others, including our children and children's children. &nbsp; <br /><br />President Spencer W. Kimball was an advocate for this kind of record keeping: "Some families possess ... spiritual treasures because ancestors have recorded the events surrounding their conversion to the gospel and other . . . miraculous blessings and spiritual experiences."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />But what if you feel inadequate in the "spiritual treasures" department? President Kimball gave us a promise: "People often use the excuse that their lives are uneventful and nobody would be interested in what they have done. But I promise you that if you will keep your journals and records, they will indeed be a source of great inspiration to your families, to your children, your grandchildren, and others, on through the generations."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />My family has a few of these recorded "spiritual treasures." I'd like to share one with you today. Over the years, it has been an important source of inspiration for me and my family. It's the story of Geertje and Pieter Janse.</p>
<p><img alt="Black and " height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Black_and_white_family_photo_200x300.jpg" width="200" /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />It begins on December 23, 1911, in the town of Middleburg in the Netherlands. My grandmother Adriana Janse, only 11 years old at the time, was skipping down the path to her home, excited about the arrival of the holidays. Not paying attention to where she was going, she bumped into a nice-looking young man who had gold fillings in his teeth and was chewing gum--sure signs that he was an American. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />When Adriana told her mother about the American who was knocking on the doors of the neighborhood, her mother, who was cleaning the stove at the time, told Adriana she wasn't interested in buying anything. The missionary must have had a good door approach, however, because eventually my great-grandmother Geertje found herself talking to the elder while keeping her sooty hands behind her back. &nbsp; <br /><br />During the course of the discussion, Geertje professed that, as a good member of the Dutch Reformed Church, she was among the saved and had the mark on her forehead, probably referring to Revelation 14:1, where the believers have the name of God on their foreheads. Then, forgetting about the soot on her hands, she "placed her forefinger on her forehead," leaving "a very black, sooty mark," much to her embarrassment.<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Despite this awkward introduction, Geertje was intrigued by the missionary's message. My great-grandmother Geertje was a deeply religious woman who was a seeker of truth. She invited the missionary back. &nbsp; <br /><br />With each visit of the missionaries, the Spirit worked on her, and eventually she desired to be baptized. Unfortunately, her husband, Pieter, my great-grandfather, did not approve. He had become convinced that it was an evil thing his wife was trying to do. He became spiteful and often angry, going so far as to tell Geertje that if she joined the Mormons, he would drown himself in the neighborhood canal. &nbsp; <br /><br />However, it's clear from the accounts left to us that Geertje was a formidable woman who knew her own mind. May 6, 1912, was set for the day of the baptism. It was rainy and cold. Pieter was still angry, but Geertje, after praying, received a witness that she should go forward. As she left to go to the baptism, she met Pieter coming home from work. He quietly said, "So you are going to do this; so I wish you luck."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> She thought perhaps her husband was reconciled to her choice. &nbsp; <br /><br />As the first to commit to baptism in the town, Geertje had the honor of being the first baptized. Family records indicate that as she stepped into the cold water of the canal, she gave a loud shout. &nbsp; <br /><br />Meanwhile, back at home things were not going well. Pieter was clearly distraught. When my grandmother Adriana served dinner, he swept it off the table onto the floor and ordered the children to bed. My grandmother remembers lying in bed in fear--she'd never seen her father "so ugly and hateful."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Three times that night, Pieter left the home, walked to the canal, and removed his hat and coat in preparation for jumping in to drown himself. Each time, the thought of his children stopped him. On the third time, a woman's shout startled him. Again, thinking about his children, he went home to check on them. It was then that he knew that he could not do such a terrible thing. &nbsp; <br /><br />The historian in me is skeptical that Pieter heard Geertje's shout from what was likely some distance away. The great-grandson part of me, on the other hand, loves this part of the story. Perhaps as a blessing for Geertje's faithfulness, the Lord intervened in this way, bringing Pieter to his senses. &nbsp; <br /><br />Three weeks after my great-grandmother's baptism, my grandmother Adriana was baptized. And finally, four months after Geertje, Pieter entered the waters of baptism. Don't you just love happy endings? If this were Hollywood, snappy music would start playing, and the credits would roll at this point. &nbsp; <br /><br />But the nice thing about real historical stories is the way they have of complicating storybook endings. Pieter lost his job at the lumberyard because of his new religion. Then war broke out in Europe. The family decided to gather to Zion. But it was a hard time for them, a strange place and new language. They weren't always treated kindly, even in Zion. Still, Geertje and Pieter remained true to the faith that they had embraced in Holland. They passed on to my mother a commitment to faith that she in turn passed on to me, and which I seek to pass on to my children.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of the family in Utah.</p>
<p><img alt="Black and White Family Photo in Utah" height="236" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Family_Photo_in_Salt_Lake_300x336.jpg" width="300" />&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The account left by my grandmother has been one of those building blocks of my faith. I confess that there have been times in my life, when facing adversity, that I've been tempted to wimp out. Living by faith isn't always easy. But the memory of the sacrifices made by Geertje and Pieter give me pause. I picture in my mind the strong face of Geertje Janse and think that perhaps I can do it after all.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />My second point about becoming our own historians has to do with gratitude. Gratitude is a wonderful virtue--grateful people are just nicer to be around, aren't they?--but showing gratitude for our blessings is also a commandment. In the Doctrine and Covenants 59, the Lord states, "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a><br /><br />President Spencer W. Kimball notes, "Those who keep a book of remembrance are more likely to keep the Lord in remembrance.... Journals are a way of counting our blessings and of leaving an inventory of these blessings for our posterity."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />President Henry B. Eyring has been an advocate for this kind of record keeping. Many of you will remember this talk.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When our children were very small, I started to write down a few things about what happened every day. Let me tell you how that got started. I came home late from a Church assignment. It was after dark. My father-in-law, who lived near us, surprised me as I walked toward the front door of my house. He was carrying a load of pipes over his shoulder, walking very fast and dressed in his work clothes. I knew that he had been building a system to pump water from a stream below us up to our property. <br /><br />He smiled, spoke softly, and then rushed past me into the darkness to go on with his work. I took a few steps toward the house, thinking of what he was doing for us, and just as I got to the door, I heard in my mind--not in my own voice--these words: "I'm not giving you these experiences for yourself. Write them down." <br /><br />I went inside. I didn't go to bed. Although I was tired, I took out some paper and began to write. And as I did, I understood the message I had heard in my mind. I was supposed to record for my children to read, someday in the future, how I had seen the hand of God blessing our family. Grandpa didn't have to do what he was doing for us. He could have had someone else do it or not have done it at all. But he was serving us, his family, in the way covenant disciples of Jesus Christ always do. I knew that was true. And so I wrote it down, so that my children could have the memory someday when they would need it. <br /><br />I wrote down a few lines every day for years. I never missed a day no matter how tired I was or how early I would have to start the next day. Before I would write, I would ponder this question: "Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today?" As I kept at it, something began to happen. As I would cast my mind over the day, I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day. As that happened, and it happened often, I realized that trying to remember had allowed God to show me what He had done. <br /><br />More than gratitude began to grow in my heart. Testimony grew. I became ever more certain that our Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. I felt more gratitude for the softening and refining that come because of the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ. And I grew more confident that the Holy Ghost can bring all things to our remembrance--even things we did not notice or pay attention to when they happened.<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a><sup></sup> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Video on Screen: Henry B. Eyring, "O Remember, Remember" Ensign, November 2017, <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember?lang=eng">https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember?lang=eng</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If we take time in our busy lives to find a quiet place to ponder the day's events and write them down, we develop gratitude, which in turn makes us more receptive to the ministration of the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />My third point today is that keeping a record of our spiritual experiences helps us remember these valuable gifts. Some years ago, Elder Richard G. Scott visited BYU-Idaho. In a meeting with the faculty, he counseled us that making a record of promptings of the Spirit or personal revelation is important--it shows our Father in Heaven that we value this gift to us. He shared this same idea in a conference talk. &nbsp; <br /><br />Elder Scott said, "Inspiration carefully recorded shows God that His communications are sacred to us. Recording will also enhance our ability to recall revelation."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a></p>
<p>I decided to follow this counsel. Since that time, I have kept a journal of things that I have been impressed to record. I have found it to be a great blessing--in both the writing and the reviewing. I use a small, low-tech spiral-bound notebook that is with me at church, when I watch conference, and close at hand during scripture study. When I record something, I'm not always sure if it's me or the Holy Ghost that feels it's significant, but I write down thoughts or ideas that come to me or something that I read or what others have said. I suspect that if anyone else were to read it, they would not find what's written there very profound or impressive, but that's okay. This record is mostly for my benefit. But I am certain that if I did not do this, I would not remember many of the moments when the Lord blessed me through the ministration of the Holy Ghost. I bear testimony that this direction from Elder Scott, to record the promptings we receive from the Spirit, can help us remember them and also show the Lord that we value them and can be trusted with them. &nbsp; <br />Now we come to my last point. An important "so what" reason to keep personal records is that writing is usually accompanied by thinking. If we keep a journal of any type, it will, if done correctly, be self-evaluative. It will help us examine our actions and thoughts in order to assist us in our own intellectual and spiritual progression. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />President Kimball called the personal journal "the literature of superiority,"<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> meaning, among other things, that it is a tool for personal improvement. To be effective, though, it needs to be an honest account. "Your journal should contain your true self," wrote President Kimball, "rather than a picture of you when you are 'made up' for a public performance."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />This kind of self-evaluation is helpful in many ways. True repentance, for example, requires reflection about our actions, asking forgiveness of the Lord, and proving ourselves through obedience. Writing about each of these steps can help us do this more effectively. &nbsp; <br /><br />It can also assist us with our relationships. Good relationships require a great deal of effort. A journal can help us evaluate how we interact with others, in order to keep our relationships healthy. &nbsp; <br /><br />In journals, we can also consider how we spend our time. Most of us are tied to technology that is endlessly diverting, keeping us from self-evaluation. I suspect that this is one of the greatest challenges for your generation. To combat this tendency, we need tools that encourage us to think. We need things like journals, which aid our interactions with the Spirit. &nbsp; <br /><br />I'd like to ask you to do something for me now. By that old-fashioned polling method--a show of hands--how many of you have at one time started or kept a journal? &nbsp; <br /><br />My purpose today hasn't been to make you feel guilty--well, maybe a little. But my hope is that we will remember why we keep these records. And that is what is important. If you are feeling overwhelmed at the moment, keeping a journal of some type might actually be a help by providing perspective at a critical time. But then again, maybe keeping personal records isn't the task for you right now. President Henry B. Eyring clarifies that, as with any tool, we should remember the reasons why we use it: "My point is to urge you to find ways to recognize and remember God's kindness.... You may not share whatever record you keep with those you love and serve. But you and they will be blessed as you remember what the Lord has done."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> &nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps, instead of journaling, you would rather turn to long talks with loved ones or improving your prayers to our Father in Heaven. It might be better for you to spend more time pondering or reading the scriptures deeply. Maybe it's being more effective in your classes so that you can better learn about who you are and your place in the cosmos. When we talk about standing in holy places, aren't some of these holy places? Certainly holier than the media that we inhabit all too much. &nbsp; <br /><br />Keeping a record of your thoughts and experiences is a systematic means of carrying out the four purposes that I have identified today. In the pre-devotional prepare assignment on I-Learn, I encouraged you to review or record a spiritual experience. For those who did make this effort, I hope you better see the importance of being your own historian. And for the rest of us, I return to that admonition now. Even if you don't feel that a daily journal is for you at this time, consider recording one or two specific spiritual experiences. I testify that it will bring blessings. And isn't it strange that we often resist doing the very things that will bring us blessings? &nbsp; <br /><br />In the book of John, the author has left an important record for you and me: a prayer of the Savior. "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."<a href="/devotionals/shawn-johansen#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a> In today's world, if we are to come to know God, we need tools like journals that help us stand, work, and live in holy places. In the words of my neighbor, recorded in my little spiral-bound journal, "We are saved not [just] by avoiding evil but embracing good." We must actively embrace the good that will help us truly know and become like our Father in Heaven and His Son. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, what a blessing it is to be gathered together today in this beautiful building at BYU-Idaho. I hope that we appreciate all the blessings of being here. I have spent many hours prayerfully trying to determine what I might say that will help you to strengthen your testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. I hope you will learn something that will help you in your personal discipleship. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us today.<br /><br />I have chosen to address the topic of contention. We live in a time where contention rages and, unfortunately, has become the norm. Not accomplished so much with swords and shields or other weapons of war, as in the past, it largely happens because we have the ability to communicate instantly with friends, family, strangers, and enemies. It is perpetuated by reports in the news media and because we can instantly reply to news items, articles, tweets, posts, snaps, and pins, often without any accountability. The back-and-forth nature of contention seems endless. He said this. She did this. They are haters. That is not politically correct. My predecessor was a failure. My replacement is inept. The right is crazy. The left is evil. People even contend over someone's perceived apathy because they are silent about an issue or event. Contention is found everywhere. It's found in race, religion, culture, politics, socioeconomic status, nationalism, reality TV drama, and in allegiance to sports figures or teams or even comic book characters. After all, everyone knows that Superman is stronger than Batman. Right? For many, contending with others seems like a game, and some are not happy unless they can argue some point or belief. Whatever the situation, contention is prevalent in our day and age. <br /><br />I was very interested in a news article I recently read. It stated that prior to the most recent presidential election, computer hackers in Russia created 180 false Twitter and Instagram accounts recognizing this as "another opportunity to sow discord in America." They seized on divisive issues "intent on exploiting existing divisions and social movements in the United States" and centered "around highly visible tension points in American politics...that have become a flashpoint between conservatives and progressives."<sup><a href="/devotionals/tyler-barton#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a></sup> This was done to create contention and even affect the outcome of the election. They were throwing fuel on the proverbial fire of contention. <br /><br />Detail from Jesus Christ Visits the AmericasDetail from Jesus Christ Visits the AmericasDetail from Jesus Christ Visits the AmericasDetail from Jesus Christ Visits the AmericasContention must have weighed heavily on the Savior's mind when He visited the Nephites, because it was one of the first things that He addressed. The Savior descended from heaven, was introduced by Heavenly Father, declared who He was, and invited those present to come to Him so that they would know for certain that He was the Christ. He then spoke to them about baptism. There must have been some disagreement among them, because the Savior said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize. And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.<br />For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.<br />Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.<sup><a href="/devotionals/tyler-barton#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>A few important things stand out to me regarding the Savior's admonition. First, He tells us where contention comes from. He calls the devil the "father of contention." It is important to recognize, when involved in contention ourselves or witnessing contention between others, that it comes from Satan. Second, Satan stirs up the hearts of men through anger and causes them to contend one with another. When we become angry and our anger dictates what we think and say and do, we do the bidding of the adversary. Thirdly, the Savior proclaims that contention is not His doctrine and that it should be done away with. He doesn't say a little anger is fine, or it's okay to argue just a little, or we're justified in contending if we are offended, or so on. He simply says, "Such things should be done away." This is a straightforward commandment. <br /><br />The scriptures are full of examples of contention. Many are found in the Book of Mormon. Laman and Lemuel were constantly contending. They were argumentative, condescending, abrasive, and generally faithless. They resorted to physical harm and even sought to take the life of their brother Nephi. Think about the many anti-Christs. Remember Sherem, Nehor, and Korihor? What were they like? They were learned, had a perfect knowledge of the language, used much flattery, and taught false doctrine. They sometimes used physical force. Finally, they were dishonest. Before their deaths, they admitted that they had deceived the people because Satan had instructed them to say those things that "were pleasing unto the carnal mind."<sup><a href="/devotionals/tyler-barton#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Think of the many wars chronicled in the Book of Mormon. Talk about contention. Do you remember names like Kishkumen, Gadianton, Amalakiah, Ammoron, and Giddianhi, the leaders of the Lamanites and the Gadianton robbers? They were continually stirring up their people to anger against the Nephites. In the end, none of their actions brought them happiness. I believe the fundamental thing that we must understand regarding contention is that, simply put, it does not lead to happiness. <br /><br />I ask you to honestly reflect on your own lives. When you are angry at someone else--be it a family member, a friend, a roommate, a romantic interest, an instructor, a church leader, or anybody else--are you truly happy? When there is contention at home or in your apartment, how does it feel? How about those of you who are returned missionaries? What was your level of success and satisfaction when in a companionship where you worked hard to get along well with each other and were genuinely of "one heart and one mind"?<sup><a href="/devotionals/tyler-barton#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> </sup>As a missionary, was there ever a feeling of contention in your companionship? What was that like? How effective were you in either of these situations? What did you do to change a contentious situation, and what were the results? <br /><br />I would like to draw on some personal experience regarding two similar situations. Both had the potential to end contentiously. First, a little background. I have worked, and still do, as a whitewater rafting guide for 38 years.</p>
<p><img alt="Family on the raft" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Family_on_river_raft_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />This has created many great memories with my family, fellow guides, and clients. One of the rivers that I guide on is the Main Fork of the Salmon River. It is a wild and scenic river that travels through 81 miles of the rugged Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, only a few hours away from Rexburg.</p>
<p><img alt="Family floating down the river" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Family-floating-river_375x200.jpg" width="375" /><br /><br />Our trips typically last five or six days. Because this is such an awe-inspiring place--with wild rapids; white, sandy beaches; dense forests; and towering peaks--the Forest Service has to regulate travel to protect it from overuse. A permit system is in place for both commercial and private users.</p>
<p><img alt="Camping by the river" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Family_camping_by_river_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />Each group that launches must have a permit and reservations for the campsites that they desire to stay at. The Forest Service supervises the campsite reservation system. A group can stay at a camp only if they have it reserved.</p>
<p><img alt="Reading in the camp" height="300" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Reading_on_the_river_beach_200x300.jpg" width="200" /><br /><br />Certain camps are very popular and, when reserved, can truly enhance a trip.</p>
<p><img alt="Floating in the rapids" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Floating_down_the_rapides_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />A few years ago, I was guiding some young men and their leaders from a ward in Utah. It was near the end of a long day that was rainy and cold. As we got close to our reserved camp, I was relieved. Everyone was cold and tired. Getting off the boats, drying out, and having some hot chocolate would revitalize us. Imagine my surprise and alarm, and maybe a little bit of anger, when we came around the bend and saw another group of boaters occupying our camp. We pulled into shore just above them, and I went down to let them know we had reserved the camp. When I arrived in their camp, which was really our camp, I had the distinct impression that this was not going to go well. I was met by a middle-aged man, who was unkempt, with long hair, numerous piercings, and tattoos. I was trying not to judge. He was finishing a beer. The biggest red flag was the black Megadeth T-shirt he was wearing. I introduced myself and showed my permit and said that his group was camping at our site, to which he replied, "We are not moving!" At least, that is the clean version. My anger started to rise, and I replied in a way that, although not profane, conveyed my unhappiness. If his group would just pack up their stuff and vacate the camp, we would be good. He found that to be amusing. I was not amused. This went on, back and forth, for a couple of minutes. My parting words as I left their, or our, camp were something like "It's people like you that give private boaters a bad name with commercial outfitters." That's the end of the story. We didn't camp at our reserved site, and I was not happy, although, in retrospect, I have wondered how I might have treated the situation differently.</p>
<p><img alt="floating on calm water" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Floating_in_small_canion_375x200.jpg" width="375" /><br /><br />Contrast this with a similar situation that occurred a few years earlier, on a different trip but on the same stretch of river. Again, we arrived at our reserved camp, only to find that it was already occupied. The group explained that someone had taken their reserved site, so they moved downriver to the next available site, knowing that it might already be reserved. They were profusely apologetic and offered to pack up their gear and leave. I discussed the situation with the crew, and we agreed that it would be best to invite them to stay at our camp for the night. They were very grateful. We went about our business, and they went about theirs. By the end of the night, we were all sitting around the same campfire, swapping stories and sharing desserts. I was happy! <br /><br />Let's look at one example from the scriptures of a people that lived in happiness. The Nephites who lived after the Savior appeared to them, established His Church, and then departed lived without contention.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth year, the people were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another....<br />And it came to pass that there was no contention among all the people, in all the land; but there were mighty miracles wrought among the disciples of Jesus....<br />And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people....<br />And how blessed were they! For the Lord did bless them in all their doings; yea, even they were blessed and prospered until an hundred and ten years had passed away; and the first generation from Christ had passed away, and there was no contention in all the land.<sup><a href="/devotionals/tyler-barton#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> </sup></p>
<p>This state of happiness continued with the Nephites for two hundred years. Imagine two hundred years of peace. No fighting, strife, rumblings, or contention. Many characteristics of this people allowed them to have such joy, peace, and happiness, but the one that stands out to me, regarding a lack of contention, is "the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people." These people had charity, the "pure love of Christ."<sup><a href="/devotionals/tyler-barton#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> </sup>Can you imagine living in a state like this? Is it possible? Could you have a home, an apartment, a ward, or an office that is free of contention? What would you individually need to do to achieve this? <br /><br /><em>The Anti-Nephi-Lehies Burying Their Swords</em> <em>The Anti-Nephi-Lehies Burying Their Swords</em> <em>The Anti-Nephi-Lehies Burying Their Swords</em> <em>The Anti-Nephi-Lehies Burying Their Swords</em> Let me relate another Book of Mormon story that I love. It shows what a change of heart can do to a once contentious people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed, or as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through the preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God working miracles in them--yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were converted unto the Lord, never did fall away.<br />For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more, neither against any of their brethren.... <br />And it came to pass that they called their names Anti-Nephi-Lehies; and they were called by this name and were no more called Lamanites.<sup><a href="/devotionals/tyler-barton#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>What helped this group become converted unto the Lord? One of the first things that I think is important is that they believed what they were taught. They had faith. It says that they became a righteous people. The righteous repent of their bad behavior. They put away their weapons of war and did not fight against God or their brethren anymore. Truly this was a people who were converted! Just how converted were they? Further examination reveals to us they were so converted that they would rather suffer death than shed the blood of another. They said, "Let us stain our swords no more."<sup><a href="/devotionals/tyler-barton#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a></sup> They recognized that the stains of sin had been removed from them through the Atonement of Jesus Christ and likened their forgiveness unto the brightness of their clean and unstained swords. "And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace."<sup><a href="/devotionals/tyler-barton#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a></sup> <br /><br />Isn't this transformation from wickedness and murder to humility and meekness miraculous? Do you think that they were truly converted? A further study shows that many of them, even 1,005 souls, died rather than break their peace-loving commitment to never stain their swords with the blood of their brethren. This transformation was complete and led them to lives of happiness and peace as they continued to live their conversion. It was so complete that they lost their desire to contend. <br /><br />Have you ever been in a situation where you have felt wronged by someone else? What is typically your first response? Do you have feelings of anger? Do you seek for revenge? Are you going to teach that person a lesson? If one of these is your first reaction, then ask yourself whom you are following? Am I following the Savior, or am I following the adversary, the father of contention? Let's take a look at the Savior's response to contention. What He says is marvelous. It really goes against human nature, which is the natural man in each of us. These instructions, by the Lord, must be very important, because they are found both in the Sermon on the Mount in the New Testament and in what He taught to the Nephites during His ministry to them. He says this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:<br />But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.<br />And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.<br />And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.<br />Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.<br />Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.<br />But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.<sup><a href="/devotionals/tyler-barton#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> </sup></p>
<p>Listen closely to the action verbs that the Savior uses in verse 44: "love," "bless," "do good," and "pray." How can we do this? It's really hard. I mean, we're expected to pray for those who treat us badly. That defies common sense, right? But what an invitation! What a challenge! We can put these admonitions into action right now. We can do as the Savior says. We can turn the other cheek, we can go the extra mile, and we can pray for those that despitefully use us. We can use kindness. We can forgive. We can say "I'm sorry." <br /><br />I recently had a conversation with a student who called the Student Honor Office to report a problem. This conversation was like many that come to our office during a semester. I listened to the report. The reporting student had had some problems with one of her roommates and felt disrespected. It was, in her mind, serious enough to involve the Student Honor Office. As I listened, I felt prompted to turn to Matthew and read to her the passage of scripture that I have just read. I asked if she would like to hear what the Savior had to say about her situation. She agreed, and we read together His counsel. I asked her how she felt. We both agreed that it looked great on paper but could be a little more difficult in reality. I asked her if she had, like His counsel instructed, ever prayed for her roommate. She said that she had not. I invited her to find a quiet place, to get on her knees, and to ask Heavenly Father if He would bless her roommate to be able to deal with the hardships in her life. I encouraged her to ask that her heart might be softened as she truly heeded His counsel. She accepted without reservation, and then our conversation ended. I'm not sure how the situation eventually worked out, but in the few minutes that I interacted with this sister, her demeanor changed. Initially, she was animated and agitated. When we were finished, her attitude was different. Although I'm sure our interaction turned out differently than she thought it would, she was calm and seemed eager to act on what we had explored together. <br /><br />On the discussion board this past week, I read many wonderful and compelling responses to the question I posed. My sincere thanks to all who posted! One response that really touched me came from Amanda Dahl, a BYU-Idaho student from Flower Mound, Texas. Her post said this: "A few weeks ago[,] my roommate and I got in a fight. The [S]pirit left immediately as I was saying rude things to her through text and she was getting more and more upset at me over text message. That afternoon I apologized and asked for forgiveness of the things I said. For the next few days I was trying to come up with a way to make our relationship better. I made her a name map. I wrote her name in the middle and wrote positive things about her all around it. This helped me think of positive thoughts toward her and helped my&nbsp;roommate feel that I cared about her. As I keep serving my roommates[,] the [S]pirit is brought to the home[,] and the love of Jesus Christ dwells in our apartment." I commend Amanda for recognizing that she needed to do something about the situation, for having the humility necessary to say she was sorry and then finding a meaningful way to serve her roommate. What a great example!&nbsp; <br /><br />Brothers and sisters, I hope that you have learned something from the things that you have heard today. I hope that you have discovered something, even just one thing, that you can do that will help you to avoid contention. I hope that the Spirit has whispered something to you that will help you commit to being a peacemaker. Perhaps you will ask for Heavenly Father's help in better controlling your anger, in not being offended by another's words, or setting a better example for those around you in both word and deed. The possibilities are endless if you will listen to the Holy Spirit. Finally, in closing, I would like to relate one last story. <br /><br />Recently I was in Hawaii for a conference. While in our opening meeting, Dr. Debbie Hippolite-Wright, vice president of student development and services at BYU-Hawaii, told a story that she remembers from her youth. It is a story that had a profound impact on her and one that illustrates beautifully the subject that I have addressed today.</p>
<p><img alt="Picture with Dr. Hippolite-Wright" height="200" src="Images/university-relations/Devotionals/Fall%202017/Graphics%20Fall%202017/Picture-with-Dr.-Debbie-Hippolite-Wright_300x200.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br />Dr. Hippolite-Wright's story takes place in New Zealand. Debbie, as I will now refer to her, is of Maori descent. One of the tribes she is a part of is Ngati Toa, which means "warrior tribe." The other is Ngati Koata. Koata is a woman's name which reflects the esteem and value of women leaders in Maori culture. She is, in her Maori tradition, a "woman warrior." <br /><br />She tells the story of when she was a child going Christmas shopping. At Christmastime, every child of the family was given 10 cents for each year of their life. This money was to be used to buy Christmas presents for siblings. Because she was 11 years old, Debbie had the grand total of $1.10 to stretch and purchase gifts for her seven siblings. Debbie's parents--her mother a fair-skinned Maori woman with red hair and blue eyes, and her father a Maori with a far darker complexion--split the children into two groups, each taking one group shopping in order to provide an element of surprise for the other group's Christmas morning. Debbie's mother guided her little ones through the local Woolworths department store to shop. <br /><br />Upon completing their shopping, as Debbie's mother, towing four young children, left the Woolworths, they were confronted by two white men who were obviously drunk. When the two men saw this light-skinned woman leading the obviously darker-looking Maori children out of the store, their prejudice surfaced. After spewing vile profanities at this family, one of the men came up to Debbie's mother and spit right in her face. When 11-year-old Debbie saw this, the "woman warrior" in her took over. She ran toward the drunkard with all of her might, her arm raised, poised to hit him or do what damage she could to the man. Just as she was about to strike, she felt a strong, firm grasp on her arm that stopped her. It was her mother, who quickly led Debbie and her siblings away to safety. <br /><br />Once Debbie's courageous mother had ensured that her precious little ones were safe, she stopped, wiped the spit from her face, got close to her daughter, and, in a clear, resolute voice, said, "You can always tell when someone has class. Class has nothing to do with how much money one has or about someone's social status; it is how you treat people. Besides that, we are members of the Church of Jesus Christ." In the midst of this frightening experience, she was teaching Debbie and her siblings how to react to difficult situations. <br /><br />I express thanks to Dr. Hippolite-Wright for allowing me to share this story. It illustrates the wisdom and experience of a woman who has learned to, as the Savior said, "Turn the other cheek." There will be times in all of our lives when we will be spat upon. This could happen physically but will more likely happen figuratively. How will we react? How will you react? Will we be able to "stain our swords no more with the blood of our brethren," in a figurative way? Will we figuratively bury our weapons of war? Will you be able to "turn the other cheek" or "to go the extra mile?" Can you "love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you"? Will you remember that you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ? It is my hope that we will always remember. I invite you to follow the guidance of the Savior. I invite you to put into practice His teachings that, while looking good on paper, are really much harder to live. If, despite this, you try in whatever way to do so, my promise to you is that the love of God will, in reality, dwell in your heart, and you will find joy and happiness as heaven smiles down upon you. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
