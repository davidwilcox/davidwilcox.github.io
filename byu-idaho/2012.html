</p>
<p>It is good to be with you on another great day at BYU-Idaho. I welcome you to a new semester and pray that the Lord&rsquo;s choicest blessings will be yours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to speak with you today about the spirit of revelation that comes through the power of the Holy Ghost. This is a topic that is familiar to you. You have discussed and maybe even taught this topic in many lessons and classes. I also know that you have experience with the Spirit and have received personal revelation. I want to build on that knowledge and experience today. I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us to teach us what you and I need to do to have the spirit of revelation in our lives, every day.&nbsp;I want to begin with two stories involving young people very much like you. The stories are true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A young woman walked slowly across the campus, deep in thought. She was at the beginning of her last semester of college. She had started to think seriously about serving a mission, but she had also been looking for a job. Just that morning she had received a very nice job offer. As she walked, she pondered what to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The young woman fasted and prayed to know if she should serve a mission or should take the job offer. Somewhat to her surprise, the mission did not feel right to her. Without a lot of specific guidance, she decided to take the job. Three months later she met the man who would become her husband.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A young father sat in his darkened apartment. It was 5 a.m. His three small children were sleeping at the neighbors. Everything in his life had been going so well; and then without any warning, everything changed. He had just come home from the hospital where he had spent all night watching his wife struggle to live. She had died an hour before of a massive brain hemorrhage.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next few days the Lord blessed the young father with tender mercies that helped him understand his wife&rsquo;s death and gave him the strength he needed to move forward to finish school and rear their children. It was a challenging, but spiritually powerful time that became the foundation of a strong family with children who knew and loved the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of these young people acted in faith and received guidance, protection, and heavenly power from the Lord. This is the spirit of revelation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You and I likewise face decisions and challenges every day. You, especially, face many critical decisions and choices at this time in your lives. Some decisions are difficult and life changing&mdash;decisions about missions, majors, occupations, dating, marriage, children, where to live, and how to live. Other decisions may seem simple and much less important. Yet even the small decisions may be part of a pattern that will lead to significant consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You and I need the Lord&rsquo;s guidance and protection every day. There will be times when we will seek His help, and there will be times when He will warn us before the danger is apparent. Every day we need what the Prophet Joseph taught Brigham Young:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them, their hearts will be ready to receive it."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what it means to have the spirit of revelation in our lives every day: &ldquo;hearts . . . ready to receive [revelation]&rdquo;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;from the Lord through the Holy Ghost. Revelation will come in the Lord&rsquo;s own way and time; our capacity to receive revelation will grow over time as we &ldquo;[continue] in God.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;As our daily walk qualifies us for the companionship of the Holy Ghost, the Lord has promised: &ldquo;my Spirit shall be in your hearts,&rdquo;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;to &ldquo;teach [you] all things,&rdquo;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;&ldquo;guide you into all truth,&rdquo;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;and &ldquo;show . . . you all things what [you] should do.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to talk with you today about how to have the spirit of revelation in your life, every day. My talk has two parts. In the first part, I focus on the nature of the spirit of revelation&mdash;what it is and how it comes into our lives. I then turn to three principles for daily living that will open our lives to the spirit of revelation: 1) live righteously; 2) ask, seek, and knock; and 3) act in faith in Christ to love and serve one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Spirit of Revelation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 8<sup>th</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord gave us a great key to and a powerful example of the spirit of revelation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the great key: &nbsp;Through the spirit of revelation, the Lord makes things known to us by the power of the Holy Ghost. As President Joseph F. Smith taught, the Lord does not reveal Himself to man through the natural eye or ear:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>". . . let me tell you [that] when the Almighty reveals Himself unto man, He does it by the power of the Holy Ghost, and not through the natural eye or the natural ear. He speaks to man as if He were speaking to him independent of his body; He speaks to the spirit."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The things of God are revealed by the Spirit of God and must be spiritually discerned. As President Boyd K. Packer has taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Perhaps the single greatest thing I learned from reading the Book of Mormon is that the voice of the Spirit comes as a feeling rather than a sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The gift of the Holy Ghost, if you consent, will guide and protect you and even correct your actions. It is a spiritual voice that comes into the mind as a thought or a feeling put into your heart."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scriptures declare that the voice of the Spirit is still and small and whispers in perfect mildness.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;As Elder David A. Bednar has taught, such revelation may come a little at a time or it may come more directly, all at once:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Some revelations are received immediately and intensely; some are recognized gradually and subtly.&nbsp; . . . &nbsp;[T]wo experiences with light . . . help us to better understand these two basic patterns of revelation. &nbsp;A light turned on in a dark room is like receiving a message from God quickly, completely, and all at once. &nbsp;. . . However, this pattern of revelation tends to be more rare than common.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The gradual increase of light radiating from the rising sun is like receiving a message from God 'line upon line, precept upon precept.'<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Most frequently, revelation comes in small increments over time. . . . This pattern of revelation tends to be more common than rare. . . ."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, for the example: The scriptural story the Lord uses to teach us about the spirit of revelation is Moses bringing the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I am sure the story is familiar to you: Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt into the wilderness toward the Red Sea. Pharaoh sent an army with horses and chariots to recapture the Israelites and bring them back to Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pick up the story as the children of Israel are camped near the Red Sea. Please turn with me to Exodus, chapter 14, verse 10. As we read these passages, please note that the dividing of the Red Sea was only part of the spirit of revelation at work in the salvation of Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that Moses witnessed to the children of Israel that the Lord would fight for them. He prophesied they would be delivered from the Egyptians if they would act on the Lord&rsquo;s command to go forward under Moses&rsquo; direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The angel of the Lord and the pillar of the cloud then moved behind the Israelites to protect them from the Egyptians. The cloud was darkness to the Egyptians and a light to Moses and the camp of Israel:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided."<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this night of miracles, the children of Israel went forward on the seabed with faith in the Lord while great walls of water loomed on either side. The Lord delayed the Egyptians&rsquo; progress, and Moses then lifted his rod again bringing the walls of water down upon the Egyptian army.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this example we see both dramatic revelation of the Lord&rsquo;s power and the still small voice of the Spirit guiding and directing through minds and hearts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost, Moses and the children of Israel received:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This story illuminates the richness of the spirit of revelation. It is a vivid example of prophecy, witness, assurance, direction, strength, and power that comes from the Lord through the spirit of revelation. It is a story highly relevant to the world we now face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything that is dear to our hearts, every righteous hope and dream depends on an increased measure of the spirit of revelation in our lives. Whatever level of the spirit of revelation we already have received, it will not be sufficient for what lies ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, an increasing measure of the spirit of revelation is everything to us. This is why it really matters, why it is so crucial that each of us strive to have the spirit of revelation in our lives, every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Three Principles for Daily Living</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>I want to share now three principles for daily living that will open our hearts and minds to the spirit of revelation. These principles are timeless; they guided Moses and they will guide us.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;I begin with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Principle #1: Live Righteously</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p>The short version of this principle is very simple: be good; keep the commandments; be true to your covenants; choose the right, every day. Of course, this includes serving in your callings, doing your home and visiting teaching, and attending the temple. We all can create a structure of righteousness in our lives by making our covenant responsibilities firm commitments in our daily and weekly schedules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President George Albert Smith gave us a beautiful statement about living righteously. I hope the metaphor he uses will stay with you all of your life. Here it is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There are two influences ever present in the world. One is constructive and elevating and comes from our Heavenly Father; the other is destructive and debasing and comes from Lucifer. We have our agency and make our own choice in life subject to these unseen powers. There is a division line well defined that separates the Lord&rsquo;s territory from Lucifer&rsquo;s. If we live on the Lord&rsquo;s side of the line Lucifer cannot come there to influence us, but if we cross the line into his territory we are in his power. By keeping the commandments of the Lord we are safe on His side of the line, but if we disobey His teachings we voluntarily cross into the zone of temptation and invite the destruction that is ever present there. Knowing this, how anxious we should always be to live on the Lord&rsquo;s side of the line."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, your faith and obedience are hallmarks of this university. I feel your goodness, every day. I also know that you face temptations. Lucifer makes his side of the line seem easy and exciting. When you feel temptation to move toward Lucifer&rsquo;s side, let President Smith&rsquo;s metaphor come into your mind. Resist temptation and embrace living on the Lord&rsquo;s side of the line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you make a mistake and fall into temptation and sin, come back quickly. You have the power to do it. Don&rsquo;t wait; don&rsquo;t linger in the zone of misery and destruction. Begin to repent now, today. You are not in bondage to your past with no way out. You can be free! Through the Atonement of Christ, you can be changed and delivered from sin, false ideas, and poor attitudes. Choose to repent.&nbsp;When we repent of our sins and seek to live on the Lord&rsquo;s side of the line every day, the transforming power of Christ&rsquo;s Atonement will take hold in our lives. Our hearts and minds will be open to the Spirit, and the spirit of revelation will be with us, every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Principle #2: Ask, Seek, and Knock</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father always knows what is best for us. He wants to give us the revelation we need; but in order to receive it, we must go to Him in prayer in the name of His Son, express our gratitude for our many blessings, and ask for what we need. Jesus said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, pray to the Father in the name of the Son, every day, morning and night. Take the time to talk to your Father in Heaven with faith and real intent. Thank Him for His many blessings. Go to Him with specific questions and concerns. Pray for others. Pray for help in school. Pray about everything, every day, morning and night. In between &ldquo;let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually. . . .&rdquo;<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is not all. If you want the spirit of revelation in your life, you must seek the voice of the Lord, every day. You must knock on the door that leads to divine instruction, every day. As Elder Robert D. Hales has taught, that means searching the scriptures, including the words of the living prophets:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"&hellip;the prophets of the Lord cry out to us on earth today: take hold of the scriptures! &hellip;walk by them, live by them, rejoice in them, feast on them. Don&rsquo;t nibble. They are 'the power of God unto salvation. . . .'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What a glorious blessing! For when we want to speak to God, we pray. And when we want Him to speak to us, we search the scriptures; for His words are spoken through His prophets. He will then teach us as we listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit."<sup>21</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that we must ponder and listen carefully when we search the scriptures or hear the living prophets. We must listen with focused attention because in them and through them we can hear the voice of the Lord. When ideas or impressions or insights come, we should write them down, &ldquo;treasure them up in our hearts,&rdquo;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;and act on them. In this way we will experience the power of the word of God, every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful that so many of you set aside time, every day, for prayer and for searching the scriptures. I know that many of you have found what I have found: it is good to start and end the day with prayer, and it is good to have a regular time to search and ponder the scriptures. Make sure you set aside sufficient time for prayer and study, and make those times a firm commitment in your daily schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that if we will use those times well&mdash;if we will pray diligently, listen, and write down what we receive in our prayers and studies&mdash;the Holy Ghost will teach us and we will hear the voice of the Lord, every day. Then when He gently and quietly speaks to us sending us on His errand, we will hear Him and we will go. When challenges come or hard decisions loom, He will hear our prayers and we will know His voice. We will have the spirit of revelation in our lives, every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Principle #3: Act in Faith in Christ to Love and Serve One Another</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p>Love is the essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As Jesus taught:&nbsp; &ldquo;[Love of God] is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, . . . love thy neighbour as thyself.&rdquo;<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This love is both intensely practical and powerfully spiritual. Jesus is the great example. In His mortal ministry He taught sublime doctrine of great spiritual power. His atoning sacrifice brought light, hope, and salvation to all who have faith in Him. He also had divine compassion for people who were suffering. He fed the hungry, healed the sick, gave sight to the blind, and opened the ears of the deaf. He did all of this because of His pure and perfect love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His example must become the guiding light that we hold up by doing what He did&mdash;serving our brothers and sisters and inviting them to come unto Him, every day. President Monson leads us today in this great work. He has taught us that people to love and serve are all around us:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My brothers and sisters, we are surrounded by those in need of our attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort, our kindness&mdash;be they family members, friends, acquaintances, or strangers. We are the Lord&rsquo;s hands here upon the earth, with the mandate to serve and to lift His children. He is dependent upon each of us."<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are the Lord&rsquo;s hands, every day. I see that in your lives. In so many ways you act with faith in Christ to lift and strengthen those around you through simple acts of service, every day. I know that if we all will pay attention and pray for the Lord&rsquo;s guidance, He will bless us with opportunities to serve. We cannot always schedule our service, but we can make sure to pray about it and think about it, every day. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serving others is a powerful way to seek, recognize and act on the spirit of revelation. Our service may be as simple as words of encouragement to someone having a hard day; it may be sharing food with someone whose cupboards are bare; it may be bearing testimony to someone whose soul is wounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we act in faith to serve with love, we humble ourselves before the Lord and leave behind selfish concerns. If we are worthy and act in faith in Him, the Lord will go with us and will bless us with His Spirit and His love. Thus, as we seek the spirit of revelation to serve others on a daily basis, we develop the capacity to receive and recognize the Lord&rsquo;s guidance when we face our own challenges and decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we learn to act in faith in Christ every day, service with love and faith will bless our families, our roommates, people in our classes, and people in our wards and stakes. We will know the Lord Jesus Christ whom we have served. He will be close to the thoughts and intents of our hearts, and we will have the spirit of revelation in our lives, every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Testimony</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, it is a great day in the kingdom! You and I live in a time when the fulness of the gospel is on the earth. I bear you my witness that God lives. Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer. He lives! In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is priesthood power and sacred ordinances that open to us rich spiritual blessings and privileges. By virtue of the Savior&rsquo;s atoning sacrifice and by obedience to His commandments, we may receive heavenly guidance, comfort, and strength through the Holy Ghost, every day. The spirit of revelation is a supernal gift to us from a loving Heavenly Father through the mercy and grace of His Beloved Son.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray that we will feel the Lord inviting us to receive this priceless gift He so much wants to give us. I know by my own experience and by the spirit of revelation that if we act on that invitation and live righteously, pray and search the scriptures diligently, and serve with love and faith, every day, this great promise of the Lord will be ours:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>". . . I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up."<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I so testify, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>It is a great blessing to be with you in devotional today. Most of you probably know that President Clark and I have been &ldquo;off track&rdquo; for a semester while he recovered from a kidney transplant. This is only the second semester of school he has missed in 41 years, so you know that school is where he likes to be! We are really glad to be back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope that we won&rsquo;t hurt your feelings by continuing to keep President at a safe distance during this season of colds and flu, but we have to keep him healthy to avoid any chance of rejecting his new kidney. He won&rsquo;t be mingling much around campus; but if he does meet you one on one and he offers you an elbow touch or a gloved hand rather than a regular handshake, don&rsquo;t take it personally and know that he loves you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been so blessed by the support and prayers of all of you. For every sacrifice and extra effort made in President Clark&rsquo;s absence and for every prayer that has been offered, we say: &ldquo;thank you. Thank you so very much.&rdquo; We have felt the power of those prayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a wonderful time in your lives. You have the great blessing to be at BYU-Idaho where the Lord has put in place for you an opportunity to gain a wonderful education while also becoming His disciple leaders. But you are going to have to work hard. You will need to be diligent in preparing for and participating in class and in doing your assignments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schoolwork is not the only hard thing you will face while you are here. Life is often hard. Challenges and trials will come that will also require hard work. But hard work alone, both in school and in dealing with trials, won&rsquo;t get you where the Lord wants you to be. You will need to open your heart and mind to the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to share with you today two principles that I know will help open your heart to the Spirit, deepen your faith, and strengthen your reliance on the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first principle is: Embrace the experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If when you are facing something that is hard you feel fearful and discouraged, remember that we all have that natural reaction. But you can choose not to let fear and discouragement drive your actions. Instead, you can choose to act in faith to embrace the experience knowing that the Lord gives us hard experiences to help us grow and learn. You can embrace the learning and growth and rely on Him to help you through whatever it is you have to endure. Let me give you an example. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little over a year ago President Clark and I were hoping for a miracle and trying to delay the deterioration of his kidneys by implementing diet and activity restrictions. But we came to understand that was not the Lord&rsquo;s plan. Instead, we felt impressed that we should embrace a transplant. That was the Lord&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We knew there would be pain and suffering involved, not just for President but for our son Andrew who would be the donor. By embracing the whole experience, President could deal with the pain and suffering knowing it would be just for a while and then this wonderful gift would make new life possible for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This decision had a tremendous impact on us. It helped us to humble ourselves before the Lord. We felt Him closer to us, and we drew closer to each other. The Lord blessed us and Andrew and his family with positive attitudes and with many, many tender mercies. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When hard things come, embrace the experience. Ask the Lord what He wants you to learn, and then embrace the pathway to learning and growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second principle is: Get outside yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another natural reaction you might have when things get hard is to withdraw inside yourself. In those times it is easy to become self-absorbed. But that is not the Lord&rsquo;s way. He wants you to get outside yourself and get some help. There are people all around who can help you. It might be a roommate, a bishop, a classmate, one of your faculty, or someone in the Tutoring Center or Counseling Center. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there are also people all around who you can help. You need to help others even when you are faced with hard things yourself. Reaching out to others opens your heart to the Spirit. It helps put your situation in perspective and keeps you from withdrawing. It keeps the spirit of entitlement out of your heart and helps keep gratitude in it. In short, helping others helps you humble yourself before the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I hope and pray that you will work hard, embrace the experiences that come your way, and get outside yourself to serve others no matter what is happening in your life. I know if you do, you will open your heart and your mind to the Holy Ghost and the Lord will guide you in your experience here at BYU-Idaho. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p>I have great love for BYU-Idaho and its predecessor institution, Ricks College, for two reasons. My son, Scott, who shares my first name but is my superior as a teacher and a poet, is now teaching in the English Department here. And, my first full time job was as a freshman English and literature teacher at Ricks College 41 years ago. My position at Ricks College was not only my first position; it was my favorite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I came to Rexburg from Palo Alto, California, in 1971 after my bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees. Rexburg was a welcome relief for me. No, not the weather&ndash;&ndash;the climate of Palo Alto is milder&mdash;in fact, I had never had my eyelashes freeze before I moved to Rexburg. It was the peace of the campus. My life during the late 60s and early 70s at Stanford University had been marked by observing protests and tear gas and broken windows. I had crossed picket lines to get to class.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ricks College, by contrast, was almost pastoral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was single and 25. I loved teaching and enjoyed the students that came from different communities from all over the United States. As a single faculty member I did not date the coeds, and so I had a lot of time to grade papers and read the scriptures. I had time to sit in on a number of religion classes and observe master teachers like President Henry B. Eyring, who was then president of Ricks College, Keith Sellers, and Mel Hammond. I loved the devotional assemblies in the Hart Building.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once while sitting in a devotional, my conscience was pierced by a comment made by then-apostle Spencer W. Kimball. To the best of my recollection, he said, &ldquo;If you are a priesthood holder and 26 years old and still single, you are a menace to the Church.&rdquo; I had just turned 25 and while I had aspirations to be married, I was not close. My number one prospect was Sister Cameron; however, at that time she was in Salt Lake City, and I was not her number one prospect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was inspired to make marriage my number one priority. As I mentioned, I had a lot of free time and used my best freshman English teacher skills to write letters. I would write about my classes and include bits of poetry we were reading, like part of Sonnet 29 by Shakespeare: &ldquo;Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, Haply I think of thee, and then my state, Like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven&rsquo;s gate; For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings, That then I scorn to change my state with kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the help of friends, I convinced Christine to visit Rexburg, and we went on a geology field trip through Yellowstone. She met President Eyring and his wife, Kathy, and we ate at Walker&rsquo;s Caf&eacute;. Could there be anything more memorable? We courted over Christmas vacation in Salt Lake, and she visited when I was called into the bishopric of the Ricks College 13<sup>th</sup> Ward.&nbsp; We were engaged at the end of my first year teaching and married two days before I turned 26, saving me from becoming a menace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wondered what would have happened had I not been intently listening in the devotional. The most important things in my life&ndash;&ndash;my wife, our six children, their spouses, and our 17 grandchildren&ndash;&ndash;might not have been mine. We spent our first year of marriage&ndash;&ndash;my second year on the faculty&ndash;&ndash;serving in the Ricks College 13<sup>th</sup> Ward with Bishop Bob Wilkes and his wife Estella and Lane and Helen Dearden. It was idyllic because we lived among people described in Moroni 7:3 as &ldquo;peaceable followers of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At approximately the same time I was asked to speak at this devotional assembly, Sister Cameron received a document entitled &ldquo;BYU-Idaho&mdash;Keeping a Sacred Trust.&rdquo; This beautiful brochure states that the primary reason for the existence of BYU-Idaho is &ldquo;to assist [you students] in developing and deepening [your] devotion as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; I immediately started thinking and praying about how I could help you develop and deepen your devotion to the Savior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two thoughts came to me. First, that I should center my address on a phrase in Isaiah 58:12: &ldquo;repairer of the breach,&rdquo; a phrase I have always associated with the mission of the Savior; and second, that I should relate that scripture to why the Savior organized a church as stated in Ephesians 4:11-13. I was concerned that I was not focusing on the Book of Mormon<em> </em>until I remembered Nephi&rsquo;s assessment of Isaiah: &ldquo;My soul&hellip;delighteth in the words of Isaiah&rdquo; (2 Nephi 25:6). And that the Savior had given a commandment to search the words of Isaiah: &ldquo;&hellip; Yea, a commandment&hellip;I give unto you that ye search these things diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah&rdquo; (3 Nephi 23:1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also knew the Savior&rsquo;s concern for both the Saints in Jerusalem and the Nephites at the land Bountiful when he was with them was to assist them in developing and deepening their devotion as disciples, and for this reason:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he [Jesus] gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ&rdquo; (Ephesians 4:11-13).</p>
<p>While the inspiration came almost immediately, over the next several weeks I wondered how a phrase from Isaiah 58 covering the true law of the fast and a brief passage in Ephesians could develop sufficiently to occupy your time.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought deeply about the phrase &ldquo;repairer of the breach.&rdquo; What is a breach? It is a separation, a division, a rift, whether accomplished over a slow process of years or a single violent occurrence, it creates a painful separation. In personal relationships, a breach can be devastating. I plumbed the depths of my legal training and remembered that a contract<strong> </strong>is an agreement between two or more parties creating obligations that are enforceable or otherwise recognizable at law. A breach of contract is a &ldquo;violation of a contractual obligation by failing to perform one&rsquo;s own promise, by repudiating it, or by interfering with another party&rsquo;s performance.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of how devastating a divorce (a breach of a marital contract) can be not only to the parties to the contract as well as those who love them. Our Heavenly Father wants us to be whole, undivided, united with Him. The adversary has wanted to cause a breach in all relationships, cause individuals to be divided and fragmented, and has done so since the war in heaven. In fact, the word &ldquo;breach&rdquo; is used in another way in times of war. If an army is defending a city against an enemy and the enemy makes a hole in the line of defense, it is said to have &ldquo;breached&rdquo; the line. Because this is a critical moment in any defense: it is usually very brave men or women who thrust themselves into the breach to prevent the enemy from penetrating further. Consequently, I read Isaiah to determine how a person can develop the courage and the wisdom to become a &ldquo;repairer of the breach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I have always felt this title was one of the most beautiful references to the Savior, who is the Savior because He is the hero of this sojourn on earth. As we know from the scriptures and from &ldquo;The Family: A Proclamation to the World,&rdquo; &ldquo;each [of us] is a spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and as such has a divine nature and destiny&hellip;&rdquo; We accepted God&rsquo;s plan to obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize [our] divine destiny as heirs of eternal life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fall of Adam caused a physical breach between each of us and our Father in Heaven; this fall separates us. Through the use of our agency, each of us has violated God&rsquo;s laws, or as Paul said in Romans 3:23, &ldquo;For all&hellip;have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.&rdquo; Sin is a breach in our relationship with God. Through His resurrection and atonement, Jesus Christ repairs the breach caused by death and sin and makes it possible for us to become whole and return to live with our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we know, it is his &ldquo;work and glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man&rdquo; (Moses 1:39) and the Savior desires our assistance in His work and glory. He instructs us that each of us needs to become perfect, &ldquo;even as [he] or [our] Father who is in heaven is perfect&rdquo; (3 Nephi 12:48).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Christ is the ultimate &ldquo;repairer of the breach&rdquo; between man and God, so Christ asks us to assist Him in repairing that breach by bringing others to Him so that they may be healed. The words of Isaiah are so beautiful to me. I can easily see why Handel in the <em>Messiah </em>chose so many of Isaiah&rsquo;s words. Isaiah&rsquo;s language and metaphors seem to speak to our hearts as well as our minds. Perhaps the language of poetry he employs is closer to the language that God taught Adam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have pondered about this phrase and how it relates to the true law of the fast, which seems to be Isaiah&rsquo;s focal point in the 58<sup>th</sup> chapter. Last fast Sunday, I seemed to get some clarification about how we increase our devotion to the Savior. I know through my reading and my own experience that merely abstaining from food does not &ldquo;constitute a true fast.&rdquo; The Pharisees were among the best at abstaining from food, but it did not help them to recognize the Son of God even when He was among them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning in verse 5 of Isaiah 58, Isaiah uses a series of rhetorical questions that we must answer in determining what is a true fast. In verse 5 he instructs Israel that fasting is not to be seen of men: &ldquo;Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not to outwardly to &ldquo;bow down our heads like a bulrush.&rdquo; We are not to &ldquo;spread sackcloth and ashes.&rdquo; Rather we are &ldquo;&hellip;to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke&hellip;&rdquo; We are to &ldquo;&hellip;deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of us have been taught to give offerings as part of our fast to assist the poor, but how do we calculate those offerings? Do you fast to check it off your obedience list and then as an afterthought calculate with an exceedingly sharp pencil the amount you have saved from not eating? Do you determine the number of ounces in a box of Honey Nut Cheerios, the cost of the box, the number of ounces in one bowl and the fraction of the entire cost of the box you saved by not eating? Do you determine the cost of a half-gallon of milk, the value of the cup you didn&rsquo;t use compared to the entire half gallon? While this may be a good exercise in mathematics, it is certainly not what is expected by the true law of the fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I could relate an experience that helped me. January 1, 2012, was Fast Sunday for the missionaries in the Missionary Training Center in Provo, and as a branch president, I fasted with them. Rather than stay up on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, I went to bed at 10:00 p.m. (At my age, one often looks for reasons to go to bed at 10:00 on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.) I awakened early on New Year&rsquo;s Day, hoping that in addition to enjoying the fast, I would be inspired in the preparation of this devotional address. I was determined that I would not bow down my head as a bulrush that I would approach the missionaries with good cheer. I succeeded in that, and it was a beautiful Sabbath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the day, I read from President Monson&rsquo;s book, <em>Pathways to Perfection</em>, in addition to many of his conference talks. I was hoping to strengthen my testimony of his divine appointment. &ldquo;It is not alone sufficient for us as Latter-day Saints to follow our leaders and to accept their counsel, but we have the greater obligation to gain for ourselves the unshakable testimony of the divine appointment of these men and the witness that what they have told us is the will of our Heavenly Father&rdquo; (Harold B. Lee, Conference Report, Oct. 1950, 130).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fasting and reading from President Monson&rsquo;s addresses helped me to become even more convinced of the prophet&rsquo;s divine appointment. However, I was still unsure what I should say in this address. I was beginning to be concerned thinking about thousands of you and taking 25 minutes of your time. Individually, it would be bad enough, but collectively, I determined that it would be approximately 400 hours for every 1,000 people in attendance.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That evening, we received a call from my brother-in-law in another state regarding a woman in his ward who was concerned about her son who lived in Provo. He had a debilitating mental condition and she was very worried that he was not eating. She had his address but wanted to get in touch with the bishop. My brother-in-law asked me to get the bishop&rsquo;s address and I agreed. The next day was a legal holiday, but I went into my office early to work on this talk. I felt I was finally making some progress when Sister Cameron called and reminded me that I needed to find the young man&rsquo;s bishop. I drove to the address I had been given, but the house was empty. I had a telephone number, and I called asking if I could speak to the young man. I was told he was not home. I asked if I could leave a message and the person said something strange: &ldquo;He can hear you.&rdquo; I said who I was and that I had a message from his mother. He gave me another address and said I could stop by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I drove to the new location and rang the doorbell. A young man not fully dressed answered the door. While I spoke to him, he alternated between being coherent and incoherent. He would periodically hit his head violently with his hand as he spoke. I asked if he had eaten and he said no; he couldn&rsquo;t remember how to open a can of soup. I asked if I could leave a blessing in his home and then get him some lunch. He agreed. I left and got some soup, a sandwich, and a fruit cup and returned to his home. He seemed to have calmed down. I was able to find out the ward he lived in and the name of the bishop so that his mother could contact him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I went back to preparing this talk, I read Isaiah 58:7-8 with new eyes: &ldquo;Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was then that I gained a new understanding of Isaiah and the true law of the fast. I learned there is a prerequisite to gaining inspiration and that is &ldquo;to bring bread to the hungry and bring the poor that are cast out into thy house, and thou seest the naked and cover him.&rdquo; I had been in a fog with regard to what to say to you dear brothers and sisters, and then I felt the &ldquo;light break forth as the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if I had decided not to visit this young man and had tried to justify my failure by saying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on a talk for several thousand BYU-Idaho students and I&rsquo;m just getting into it. I can&rsquo;t break up my day and look for someone in distress that I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; What if I had just called back and told my brother-in-law, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but the house was vacant at the address I had been given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what was the light that broke forth as the morning? I learned that fasting and serving others is a prerequisite to obtaining help from heaven. Through fasting, I also saw the link with Ephesians 4:11 and why we are so blessed to have a prophet and apostles and evangelists and pastors and teachers so that we can become like the Savior: &ldquo;repairers of the breach.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order that He can repair the breach in our own lives and then look to others to assist in the work of &ldquo;repairing the breach&rdquo; in their lives, Christ did the following for us: &ldquo;And he [Jesus] gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ&hellip;&rdquo; (Ephesians 4:11-12)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the offices that Jesus put in His church to assist us: apostles and prophets. President Monson is an example. As I read his biography and his talks, I realized a pattern in his talks. It is the pattern for how we become like the Savior and obtain revelation in our lives. His stories are for children and all those who humble themselves like a little child. What happens to your heart when you hear this story from President Monson&rsquo;s biography, written by Heidi Swinton?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the home was buzzing with Thanksgiving preparations when Charlie Renshaw, a friend over the back fence, stood outside, as was the custom&hellip;and hollered, &lsquo;Tom-my!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you eating?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy told him it was turkey, and Charlie asked what turkey tasted like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom responded, &lsquo;Oh, about like chicken,&rsquo; to which Charlie asked, &lsquo;What does chicken taste like?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom ran into the kitchen, snatched a piece of breast meat, and handed it to his friend. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s good!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Tom asked what Charlie&rsquo;s family was having for dinner the answer was, &lsquo;I dunno. There&rsquo;s nothing in the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom had no turkeys or chicken or money. But he did have two pet rabbits, a male and a female, the pride of his life. He motioned to his friend and headed for the specially constructed rabbit hutch...and reached in and grabbed his two pet rabbits, put them in a gunnysack, and handed the bag to Charlie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said: &lsquo;Rabbit meat tastes better than chicken.&rsquo;"</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, when one gives a love gift, all that one has, the meal will taste better than any dish prepared by a gourmet chef. President Monson&rsquo;s stories are not just stories. They teach us how to become like the Savior. He tells us &ldquo;that we should always&rdquo; to obey the Spirit&rsquo;s nudge to visit the sick even when it is inconvenient or seems to conflict with other Church duties. Through his stories I have realized that visiting those in need is even more important that conducting a church meeting. Inspiration and revelation come from serving others. I note that C.S. Lewis was an atheist until he was converted by the children&rsquo;s stories of George MacDonald, a Presbyterian minister from Scotland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love President Monson&rsquo;s stories because they educate my heart and help me understand Matthew 25:40: &ldquo;Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.&rdquo; When I followed President Monson&rsquo;s example and Isaiah&rsquo;s promptings, when serving someone was more important than talking about service, I realized there is a causal connection between loving others and receiving inspiration as stated in Isaiah 58:7-9. If you deal your bread to the hungry and assist the poor, and cover the naked: &ldquo;Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading President Thomas S. Monson&rsquo;s words, pondering them, and praying about them, I have a testimony of his divine appointment. I have that same testimony of President Henry B. Eyring and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf and the Twelve Apostles. I believe that as we follow them and listen to them, we will be able to &ldquo;call, and the Lord shall answer&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to speak of some other special people the Savior established to assist us to increase our devotion to him. Paul mentioned evangelists and pastors and teachers. An evangelist is a patriarch, as Elder Russell M. Nelson taught us in October conference: &ldquo;His Church provides patriarchal blessings to give each recipient a vision for his or her future as well as a connection with the past, even a declaration of lineage back to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob&rdquo; (<em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 2011, 88).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would encourage each of you to get your patriarchal blessing so that you understand why the Savior has called them to help you. Paul says that the Savior also gave pastors to assist us. A pastor is a bishop. There is something important about the mantle of the bishop and about the keys he holds. I don&rsquo;t know how to tell you except that when I was ordained a bishop, I saw people differently. As a counselor in the bishopric, I had sat on the stand every week for several years. I knew which pew was occupied by each family. They always sat in the same place and so it was easy to determine who was missing. The week after I was ordained a bishop, I sat on the stand as usual, but I saw people in a new way. It was most noticeable with the widows who sat together on the left side about half of the way back. Usually I just noted who had been at the hairdressers by the tint in their white hair. This week it was as if I saw their years of caring for their families and serving others and they were radiant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe my bishops have had special insights into my heart, and I thank them for helping me understand the atonement, repent of my sins, and prepare for the blessings of the temple. May I suggest that the bishops of your Young Single Adult wards are called of God and as good as they are on their own, they are better when the mantle of a bishop rests on their shoulders. You young men and young women who plan to serve missions, let them help you prepare and repent and become fully worthy to serve; to assist the Savior in repairing the breach. If you try to serve while still feeling the effects of a breach in your life, it will hurt and until you go back and allow the Savior&rsquo;s atonement to heal that breach, you will not be able to serve. You may feel the Holy Ghost on occasion, but the Holy Ghost will not be able to be the constant companion you will need as an emissary of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you may not think the teachers that Paul mentions are your teachers here at BYU-Idaho, but I would like to venture that they are. In Mormon 17, we read that in addition to King Benjamin, who was given to lead the people, &ldquo;&hellip;there were many holy men in the land, and they did speak the word of God with power and with authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my own experience, the men and women who teach you are not only brilliant and accomplished; they are good. They want what is best for you. They want you to be prepared in your chosen academic and professional fields. They know that once you begin work the time for preparation is over, if you have not been properly trained you will suffer the embarrassment of not being able to do what you should have learned. They occasionally ask for a lot because they want you to apply yourselves and be competent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These teachers want you to learn the scriptures and feel the power of music; they want you to discover for yourself the feeling of satisfaction that comes from applying your mind diligently to understand a formula or an equation, or how the branches of government work and how can you work within the laws of man. They want you to have happy and productive lives. Isaiah prophecies of the results in your lives if you live the true law of the fast and follow those who have been chosen to lead you: &ldquo;And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I began my devotional address by saying that here at BYU-Idaho I found myself among the &ldquo;peaceable followers of Christ.&rdquo; May I suggest this is a blessed place to repair any breach that you may find in your life through the Savior&rsquo;s love. You have the opportunity to be instructed by apostles and prophets, you have wonderful bishops to help you, and teachers who not only care about your happiness in mortality but also in eternity. The year 2012 is a great year to prepare to fill your role in your families as well as in the kingdom by following the Savior and becoming a &ldquo;repairer of the breach, [a] restorer of paths to dwell in.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new year. I have a strong feeling that 2012 will be a great year for all of us. It could be one of the most exciting years for the Church in its 182 year history. It could also be a year of new challenges, as the Church will likely be subject to increased attention and public scrutiny. Are we prepared to take on the challenges the New Year will bring to each of us as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we drove up to campus today, Barbara and I passed the beautiful Rexburg Temple. Perhaps, a few of you in this congregation were here when the temple was dedicated nearly four years ago. May I ask those of you who were here to recall the spirit you felt at the time of the temple open house. There is a unique spirit which we always feel as we enter the holy temple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is sometimes a wide difference&mdash;a gulf of misunderstanding&mdash;between the ways we experience the Church from the inside and the ways others look at it from the outside. This is the principal reason we hold open houses for temple dedications. The member volunteers at the temple open houses are simply trying to help others see the Church as they see it from the inside. They recognize the Church is a marvelous work, even a wonder, and they want others to know it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph Smith wrote his history to &ldquo;disabuse the public mind, and put all inquirers after truth in possession of the facts&rdquo; (JSH 1:1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The growing visibility and reputation of the Church presents a remarkable opportunity to us as its members. We can help to &lsquo;disabuse the public mind,&rsquo; and correct misinformation when we are portrayed as something we are not. More importantly, though, we can share who we are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a number of things that we can do&mdash;that you can do&mdash;to advance understanding of the Church. If we do it with the same spirit, and conduct ourselves in the same way we do when we host a temple open house, our friends and neighbors will come to understand us better. Their suspicions will evaporate, negative stereotypes will disappear, and they will begin to understand the Church as it really is&rdquo; (L. Tom Perry, <em>Ensign</em>, November 2011).</p>
<p>Today, I would like to issue a challenge to you&mdash;the future graduates of BYU-Idaho. Prepare yourselves now to take advantage of the significant opportunities the New Year will bring to all members of the Church. Demonstrate by what you say and the lives you live by the teachings of our Savior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we ponder the eternities for just a moment, we recognize that none of us are here and now by happenstance. Our mortal test is designed in such a way that we do not recall the great council in heaven when our Heavenly Father&rsquo;s purposes and plan were first revealed to us. Still, those with &ldquo;eyes that see&rdquo; and &ldquo;ears that hear&rdquo; see and hear about events foretold by prophets on an increasingly frequent basis. None of us know when the Savior will come again, but I&rsquo;m quite certain that you sense, as I do, an unmistakable acceleration in the fulfillment of prophecy. Each of us must prepare now to play his or her foreordained part as the final pieces of Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan come together in this, the Dispensation of the Fullness of Times. There will be much required of us because much has been given to us (Luke 12:48; D&amp;C 82:3), but no one who is prepared should fear, for we have been promised: &ldquo;If ye are prepared, ye shall not fear&rdquo; (D&amp;C 38:30).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the Church of Jesus of Latter-day Saints is truly a world-wide church. Nevertheless, it is important for all of us to realize that the Church could never have become what it is today without the birth of a great nation, the United States of America. The Lord prepared a new land to attract the peoples of the world who sought liberty and religious freedoms. The new land was blessed with strong leaders who felt duty-bound to establish a government that allowed individuals to worship according to their own conscience. The Founding Fathers believed religious faith was fundamental to the establishment of strong government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Americans have forgotten the central importance of religious beliefs in the formation of the policies, laws, and rules of government. Many of our fellow citizens do not understand that the Founders believed the role of religion would be as important in our day as it was in their day. The Founders did not consider &ldquo;religion and morality&rdquo; an intellectual exercise&mdash;they forcefully declared it an essential ingredient of "good government and the happiness of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This position was set forth by President George Washington in his <em>Farewell Address. </em>He said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. . . . And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. . .reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail to the exclusion of religious principle. It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The United States is the Promised Land foretold in the Book of Mormon&mdash;a place where divine guidance directed inspired men to create the conditions necessary for the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It was the birth of the United States of America that ushered out the Great Apostasy, when the earth was darkened by the absence of prophets and revealed light. It was no coincidence that the lovely morning of the First Vision occurred shortly after the establishment of this great nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The First Vision precipitated a flood of revealed truth. Knowledge was restored about the nature of the Godhead; a new translated scripture gave a second witness and testament of Jesus Christ; the restoration of the priesthood re-endowed mankind with the power and authority to act for and on behalf of God in conducting priesthood ordinances and reestablishing the Church of Jesus Christ on the earth. Again, we are blessed to be members of a world-wide Church that was organized 182 years ago in Fayette, New York. At that moment in time, the Church had six members, and, today, we are over 14 million strong and growing. As Alma taught his son, Helaman&mdash;&ldquo;. . . that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass&rdquo; (Alma 37:6).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October 1972, nearly 40 years ago, I was called by President Harold B. Lee to be a General Authority. Twenty years earlier, President Lee, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, ordained me a high priest. I had infrequent contact with President Lee between these important events, but I was always attentive to the lessons he taught at General Conference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Lee had a beautifully clear understanding of priorities.&nbsp; He once taught: &ldquo;Much of what we do organizationally . . . is scaffolding, as we seek to build the individual, and we must not mistake the scaffolding for the soul.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Lee was not minimizing the role of the Church in the salvation of men, women, and families. What he did teach powerfully was that the core of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is individuals and families, and the Church functions as a support system to individuals and families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of you are at the wonderful and confusing time of life when you are selecting the plans for building your family and professional lives. The decisions you make at the beginning of your adult lives are clearly the most important decisions of your life because they shape everything that comes after. In the rest of the time I have today, I want to explore with you how the Church of Jesus Christ can provide scaffolding as you engage in these, your life&rsquo;s two most important building projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee also said the Church is the scaffold with which we build eternal families.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I belong to a branch of the Wing family tree. Members of the Wing family still own the oldest home built in New England that has stayed in the same family. It is called the Old Fort House. It was the home of Stephen Wing and his family after they arrived in this country about 1635.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nucleus of the house was constructed for protection. Its walls are two feet thick, made of hewn oak trunks driven into the ground to form the typical construction of a New England garrison. There are two separate walls. The space in between was filled with sandstone for protection against the arrows and bullets of the Indians. The fort was the center of their home. As the Wing family grew, it added onto the sides of the original fort house.&nbsp; But the fort remained their protection, their safe haven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps each of us should consider building structures for our spiritual security, free from the influences of the world&mdash;places where we can protect and also teach family members how to meet the challenges of a world that is always threatening our core values. I prefer to be optimistic, so I continue to hope for positive change in the world, but I&rsquo;m also a realist so I form a contingency plan in case positive changes don&rsquo;t come. My contingency plan for spiritual security must account for all the content&mdash;both good and evil&mdash;that is being pushed through various media. Where do I look to learn about how to build such a contingency plan for the spiritual security of my family? I look to the Church&mdash;the scaffold with which I build an eternal family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two principle reasons why I appreciate President Lee&rsquo;s metaphor for the Church&mdash;as scaffolding for our eternal families. First, it helps me understand what the Church is. Second, and equally important, I understand what the Church is not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Church as scaffolding is perhaps best represented by the statement by the Prophet Joseph Smith about his role as the leader of the Church. He said: &ldquo;I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.&rdquo; Eternal principles are the scaffolding the Church provides. These eternal principles are embedded in the doctrines of the Kingdom of the Eternal God, and reflected in His eternal plan of happiness. We meet as members of the Church to teach and learn from each other the principles of righteousness and receive saving ordinances so the scaffolding is steady and stable as we build our eternal families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that the Church is not meant to do the work of parents&mdash;it guides the work of parents. The Church offers an eternal form. As builders of eternal families, we are reassured by promises that if we build according to this eternal form, our efforts can provide the safety and protection we seek for those we love most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My young friends, your challenge is to use the Church as scaffolding to build a family that is as spiritually strong or stronger than the old Fort House is physically strong. How is this done?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe family traditions are like the hewn oak trunks driven into the ground to build the old Fort House. Make the honoring of family traditions and the development of new ones a priority throughout your lives. Holiday traditions, birthday traditions, Sunday traditions, dinner-time traditions &ndash; honor them, write them down and make certain you follow them. Studies show that the reason young people join gangs is for the tradition and ritual of belonging to something larger than self. That is what a family should be. Be certain you are creating a rich environment for your family to look forward to these special times of the year when traditions hold you together as a great eternal family unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please understand this is neither a simple nor an easy solution. Just as Rome was not built in a day, neither are family traditions. Family traditions can offer the basic and lasting support, but there&rsquo;s a lot that must be built around them. Perhaps, family traditions only work when they create a role for every member of the family, and there is united effort to build them. This means family members need to spend time together and also learn how to work together. When it comes to families, there is no such thing as quality time without a certain quantity of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you consider your future employment an important consideration is how much time it will demand of you each day. Is it one that will keep you working 14 hours a day and establish a consistent pattern of arriving home after your children are in bed? I&rsquo;m not suggesting such employment opportunities are out of bounds, but if you choose them, you must find creative ways to remain connected to your family. The scaffolding of the Church will help remind you of your eternal priorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my career, I selected the retail business. Our stores were open six days a week from 10 in the morning until 10 at night. My normal work day was at least 10 hours, sometimes 12 to 15. I had to be very careful to have time for my children, and I believe the Church as scaffolding continuously reminded me of my eternal priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, I involved all of my children in part-time jobs at our stores. My oldest daughter used to come in and update sales figures so my reporting was always current and I could make year-over-year comparisons. It was a big job before the age of electronic spreadsheets.&nbsp; All the figures had to be entered by hand. I had my son work in Accounts Payable during the summer. This gave us the opportunity to see each other during the day, and have lunch together several days a week. I taught my youngest daughter how to run a cash register so she could be a part-time cashier, again giving me opportunity to spend precious time with her. In all cases, the best time together was during the daily commute to and from work. This was precious one-on-one time with each of my children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to our family lives, I also believe the Church can provide scaffolding for our professional lives. Please remember that when you graduate and leave this great institution you are marked for life as both a graduate of BYU-Idaho and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In effect, you leave here as representatives of Jesus Christ and His Church. In this respect being &ldquo;as good as&rdquo; someone else from another university or who belongs to another church is not good enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President George Albert Smith taught us a lesson by saying in a lesson you&rsquo;ve already been taught this year in Priesthood and Relief Society. President Smith said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within the last year, I have had the privilege of meeting and conversing on the gospel with some men who live in this community [Salt Lake City], not members of our Church. One man had resided here for twenty years, a man whose life is above reproach, a good citizen, a splendid business man, one who has kindly feelings towards our people.&nbsp; He told me that he had lived here twenty years, and he had come to the conclusion that we were just as good as our neighbors who are members of other churches; he could not see any difference in us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to say to you, my brethren and sisters, that is no compliment to me. If the gospel of Jesus Christ does not make me a better man, then I have not developed as I should, and if our neighbors not in this Church can live among us from year to year and see no evidence of the benefits that come from keeping the commandments of God in our lives, then there is need for reform in Israel.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; Are you doing your duty? are we performing the labor that the Lord has entrusted to our care? do we sense the responsibility that is upon us? or are we idly floating down stream, going with the tide taking it for granted that in the last day, we will be redeemed?&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>A member of the Church who is worthy of a temple recommend should always stand out in whatever professional circles he or she belongs. My advice to you is to dare to be different. Never worry about offending others by living up to the standards of the Church. I promise you that living up to temple recommend standards will bless and never hurt you in any situation in which you may find yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me offer a personal example. Again, my business career was as a retail executive. As such, I was required to attend trade association meetings, business clubs, chamber of commerce meetings, etc. They always started with a cocktail hour. I was always uncomfortable in the setting. Nearly everyone would be holding an alcoholic beverage in their hands as they mingled together. I asked myself, &ldquo;What could I hold in my hand to represent my standards and the standards of the Church?&rdquo; I realized that if I didn&rsquo;t hold a glass in my hand someone would always be wanting to buy me a drink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I tried holding 7-Up, but it looked the same as other bubbly, alcoholic drinks. Finally, I decided to walk over to the bartender and request a glass of milk. I thought he might be hard of hearing because he made me repeat my order three times.&nbsp; The final time was loud enough that everyone in the room could hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After fumbling around for a few minutes the bartender finally handed me a glass of milk. You can imagine the ribbing I received as I mingled the rest of that evening, but I knew my standards, and I was undeterred. The next month, at the same meeting, I ordered my milk. From then on, the bartender always had a glass of milk for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then a funny thing started to happen. At future meetings more people started ordering milk and drinking it with me. They confided in me that their wives did not like them drinking because it might impair them as they drove home. Instead of feeling awkward during cocktail hour, I soon became the center of conversation. It helped me meet more people and fulfill the purposes for which I attended those gatherings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I learned an important lesson from this experience. If I kept my promises to the Lord, He would always keep His promises to me. He would always fulfill his end of the bargain&mdash;and much, much more&mdash;if I fulfilled mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I read and watch the news each day, I am shocked at the difficulties we are creating for ourselves. As times and conditions change and become more complex, there seem to be fewer and fewer individuals capable of shouldering the responsibilities of leading positive change. I wish to issue a challenge to you who are leaders and future leaders to recognize the world is changing very rapidly. There is an urgent need for leaders capable and bold enough to take on the immense challenges that face us today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The moral foundation of a strong Judeo-Christian tradition appears to be eroding in the United States. This tradition was based on justice, compassion, and respect for human dignity. It was not based on laws and regulations, but the light of Christ in every good and decent American. It was something that was part of the character of most men and women of a country that was &ldquo;one nation under God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the number of citizens who subscribe to these beliefs and values is dwindling, you and I remain true. I believe that more than anything else this is because the Church is scaffolding for both our family and professional lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know a little bit about scaffolding because over my lifetime I have been involved in building many chapels in different communities of this great country, on an island in the Pacific, and in Nagasaki, Japan. I know scaffolding allows me to reach heights I could not otherwise reach, and do things I could not otherwise do. One also needs to be careful on scaffolding because it is easy to fall off and injure oneself. Still, if we stay firmly centered on the scaffolding of the Church we remain safe and protected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are the generation the Lord has saved for this day. You, like all baptized members of the Church, have taken upon yourselves the name of Jesus Christ. You have covenanted with Him to represent Him. By representing Jesus Christ, you can help many of your brothers and sisters remember their Judeo-Christian traditions by reflecting the light of Christ in your lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You and I must be bold in our declarations of the divinity of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; We want others to know that we believe He is the central figure in all human history. His life and teachings are the heart of the Bible and the other books we consider to be Holy Scriptures.&nbsp; The Old Testament set the stage for Christ&rsquo;s mortal ministry. The New Testament describes His mortal ministry. The Book of Mormon gives us a second witness of His mortal ministry. He came to earth to declare His gospel as a foundation for all mankind so that all of God&rsquo;s children could learn about Him and His teachings. He then gave His life in order to be our Savior and Redeemer. Only through Jesus Christ is salvation possible. This is why we believe He is the central figure in all human history. Our eternal destiny is always in His hands.&nbsp; It is a glorious thing to believe in Him and accept Him as our savior, our Lord, and our Master.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May the Lord continue to bless you, my very special brothers and sisters. You are blessed with a royal heritage. You are part of this very wonderful school which has been dedicated to preparing bright minds to go forward and bring positive change to a troubled world. &nbsp;You reflect the light of Christ. Please remember all that the scaffolding of the Church has done, is doing, and can do for your family and professional lives. This is not any other church, but the Restored Church of Jesus Christ. Of this, I testify in His holy name, even the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Sometimes we experience God and His works through powerful&mdash;even overwhelming&mdash;feelings. It may be for us as it was for Jeremiah with &ldquo;burning fire shut up in [our] bones.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> Or like Heber C. Kimball who felt &ldquo;as though [his] body would consume away.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup> The Apostle Paul adds &ldquo;love, joy, peace . . .&nbsp; gentleness, [and] meekness&rdquo;<sup>3</sup> to the list of words that may describe our feelings when in the Spirit. And sometimes words are utterly inadequate. Such moments may be, as Tennyson wrote, &ldquo;too full for sound and foam.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When our hearts are full and we are filled with confidence, even the hard things are easier to do. I suspect that many within the sound of my voice have, at one time or another, felt the conviction that comes with strong spiritual experiences; the conviction that brings &ldquo;the mighty change . . . in our hearts, that we have no more desire to do evil, but to do good continually.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup> You have heard a talk or a sermon or a lesson; you&rsquo;ve been listening to uplifting music or studying the scriptures; and you have felt well up in your heart the thought, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ever want to do anything bad again. I only want to be good.&rdquo; And for a while thereafter, it was easier to do right and to act in faith. But as C.S. Lewis wrote and Elder Neal A. Maxwell quoted more than once, &ldquo;The cross comes before the crown, and tomorrow is a Monday morning.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup> I think Elder Maxwell loved that phrase so much because it reminds us that frequently we have to get through trials to get to blessings. But maybe just as frequently&mdash;maybe <em>more</em> frequently-- what we have to get through is nothing more dramatic than Monday morning. What we have to get through is the mundane, the common, the relentlessly routine to get to the blessings. Sometimes the trial is actually in the insistent ordinariness of the day-to-day. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may think it would be great if we could move through life in perpetual spiritual bliss; with our bosoms constantly on high burn within us. But I&rsquo;m not sure that that would be very practical. And anyway, it seems that God is pleased to have us come up to the mountain as often as we can for strength and reminders, always to return us to the valley to do the heavy lifting of covenant-keeping and Christian living. So while we love the strong feelings that come with great spiritual experiences and the confidence they impart, there will be days when you do not feel that way. In fact, there may come weeks at a time when you must press forward even though you do not feel it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the October 2008 General Conference, Elder Neil L. Andersen said, &ldquo;Faith is not only a feeling; it is a decision.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup> Let me quote that again, &ldquo;Faith is not only a feeling; it is a decision.&rdquo; At least one of the implications of that statement is that faith can be present even in the absence of powerful feelings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith is a decision. It is a choice to act on what we have been taught and we know to be right even when we don&rsquo;t feel like it; it is moving forward and pushing on even when we are not feeling&mdash;and it may have been some time since we felt&mdash;the strong convictions of the Spirit. In fact, deciding to act in faith, even when we are not feeling very faith-filled, sometimes brings heaven&rsquo;s most remarkable blessings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Luke chapter 5 we find Peter being asked to do something when he was not in the mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon [Jesus] to hear the word of God, he stood by the Lake of Gennesaret [another name for the Sea of Galilee], and saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Peter, as you know, was a fisherman and it seems that he worked with his brother Andrew and his partners James and John. It was a morning after a long night of fishing on the Sea of Galilee&mdash;made longer by the fact that they had caught nothing. The Sea of Galilee had&mdash;and still has now&mdash;some 25 native species of fish. But the two major species, the two from which fishermen made their living&mdash;then and now&mdash;are tilapia and lake sardines.&nbsp; The sardines come out into the open at night and so they are generally caught at night in large encircling nets which, in those days, were cast by hand onto the surface of the water, allowed to sink to the bottom pulled down by weights sewn in to their perimeters, and then hauled back to the boat by hand with a rope. The rope was attached to strings which were, in turn, tied to the edges of the net so that, when pulled, the net would close up like a bag.<sup>9</sup> It required strength and stamina to throw the nets out, haul them back in, open them, empty them, and throw them out again over and over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luke chapter 5 begins as Peter and the others are doing the tedious but necessary daily work of washing their nets after a night of fishing&mdash;presumably for sardines. The nets needed to be cleansed of debris and any accumulated plant material then stretched out to dry after every fishing session. If the nets were not washed and dried they would rot and break.<sup>10</sup> So, like it or not, it had to be done every time&mdash;even on mornings after long nights when nothing had been caught.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior was there on the lake shore that morning and a crowd had gathered hoping to hear him teach. To make it easier for everyone to hear, the Savior asked Peter if he could step into his boat and push out a little. The crowd would stay on the shore and the Savior would speak to them while sitting in the boat. The arrangement would create something like a natural amphitheater. We should note that, as far as we can tell, this is only the second time that Peter has met Jesus. Andrew had introduced him once before but there is no evidence that Peter had yet determined to follow him. All the same, the Lord politely asked this favor of Peter. While he was working on his nets, his frustratingly empty boat was just sitting there, reminding him of his wasted night. So he consented and Jesus did as he had proposed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, Luke tells us absolutely nothing about the sermon the Lord taught to the crowd that morning. Not one word. Apparently, all of this has just been set-up for what Luke really wants to tell us. For Luke, the real story is what is about to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to imagine this with me: The sermon is over and the boat is brought back the few yards to shore. Peter drops his now washed and dried and folded nets into the empty boat. He sighs that tired sigh that means the work is finally done. Perhaps he now turns his thoughts to breakfast and home and rest. It is in this moment that the Lord Jesus Christ looks Peter in his weary face and says, &ldquo;Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup> In other words, &ldquo;Take those nets you just cleaned and put away, and sail back out on to that Sea you just spent all night on, and use your tired, aching muscles to throw the nets out again and see if we can&rsquo;t catch some of those fish that are nowhere to be found today.&rdquo; Can you imagine the look on Peter&rsquo;s face in this moment? Peter seems to begin his response to the Lord intent on saying no, but something happens half-way through: &ldquo;Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing.&rdquo; I imagine a long pause here as the Lord listens to Peter while calmly, firmly, lovingly, expectantly gazing at him. Peter changes course: &ldquo;Nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the net.&rdquo;<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.&rdquo; Where there had been nothing, there was now so much that their nets could not handle the load. &ldquo;And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.&rdquo; Their forlornly empty boats were now filled beyond their capacity to remain afloat. Now, that&rsquo;s a lot of sardines!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now amidst the excitement and the yelling and the laughter and the splashing, Peter stops and falls to his knees right in the fish. &ldquo;Depart from me,&rdquo; he says to Jesus, &ldquo;for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&rdquo; We may come to know Christ and feel our testimonies move up to the next level at the most surprising moments. For Peter, it happened when he was weary and discouraged and knee deep in fish; but when he had, nevertheless, responded to an invitation from the Savior; when he had done something he was not in the mood to do. Faith is not just a feeling; it is a decision. I think that sometimes the pay-off is more powerful in moments like these because the Lord has allowed us to illustrate&mdash;to Him and to ourselves&mdash;that our commitment is bigger than the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I once heard Elder Paul V. Johnson of the Seventy speak at a college convocation here on our campus. He told of a talking GPS system he had used in a rental car. He noted that the voice only spoke to him when the car was moving. The GPS knew where he was but it could not give him turn by turn directions to his destination&mdash;it could not say &ldquo;turn right&rdquo; or &ldquo;turn left&rdquo; or &ldquo;turn around and go the other way&rdquo;&mdash;until it knew which direction he was heading. With a GPS, you have to get moving to receive directions and course corrections. Feelings and direction from the Spirit work in much the same way. Sometimes you have get moving before you will feel the Holy Ghost&rsquo;s confirming influence. Elder Richard G. Scott said it this way, &ldquo;A rudder won&rsquo;t control a drifting boat; it must be underway. . . . You need to be moving forward.&rdquo;<sup>13</sup> And Moroni wrote, &ldquo;Ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.&rdquo;<sup>14</sup> That is, we must act in faith, then the confirming feelings will come. Faith is a decision, an action, before it is a feeling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, suppose you have gone an extended period without feeling much in the way of spiritual feelings. What should you do? First, examine your life. If you need to make some changes, make them. If you need to talk to your bishop, do it. Satan will try very hard to stop you from taking that step. He will tell you that however badly you feel now, talking to the bishop will only make it worse. He will tell you that the humiliation and possible restrictions associated with confessing will be much worse than whatever you are going through now. He will tell you that it is better to live with it than to go to the priesthood with it. He will be lying. He is desperate to keep you in the secret combination you have formed with him. He knows that telling the truth to a key-holding representative of Jesus Christ will shatter the bands he has you in and flood the situation with light. He knows that the enabling grace of Jesus Christ will begin working in you before you even leave the bishop&rsquo;s office. I again quote Elder Scott, &ldquo;This struggle is prolonged through indecision, and that means more pain and further damage. It can be cut short through decisive personal commitment to clean up your life. . . . Right now.&rdquo;<sup>15</sup> Push past Satan&rsquo;s nay-saying and go see your bishop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what if upon examining your life, you see nothing obviously amiss? Though you have not been regularly feeling the Spirit, you do not detect any conspicuous blockages. What then? I have a suggestion for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you remember sitting at an arts and crafts table somewhere, sometime in your life, braiding some long strips of plastic into what some people call a boondoggle or a lanyard? One of my favorite American poets writes of one he made as a 9-year-old boy and gave to his mother:</p>
<p><em>I had never seen anyone use a lanyard</em></p>
<p><em> or wear one, if that&rsquo;s what you did with them,<br /> but that did not keep me from crossing<br /> strand over strand again and again<br /> until I had made a boxy<br /> red and white lanyard for my mother.</em></p>
<p><em>She gave me life and [nourishment from her own body],<br /> and I gave her a lanyard.<br /> She nursed me in many a sick room,<br /> lifted spoons of medicine to my lips,<br /> laid cold face-cloths on my forehead,<br /> and then led me out into the airy light</em></p>
<p><em>and taught me to walk and swim,<br /> and I, in turn, presented her with a lanyard.<br /> Here are thousands of meals, she said,<br /> and here is clothing and a good education.<br /> And here is your lanyard, I replied,<br /> which I made with a little help from a counselor.</em></p>
<p><em>Here is a breathing body and a beating heart,<br /> strong legs, bones and teeth,<br /> and two clear eyes to read the world, she whispered,<br /> and here, I said, is the lanyard I made at camp.<br /> And here, I wish to say to her now,<br /> is a smaller gift&mdash;not the worn truth</em></p>
<p><em>that you can never repay your mother,<br /> but the rueful admission that when she took<br /> the two-tone lanyard from my hand,<br /> I was as sure as a boy could be<br /> that this useless, worthless thing I wove<br /> out of boredom would be enough to make us even.</em><sup>16</sup></p>
<p>These words hit a little close to home for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The realization of the magnitude of my debt to my mother came to me in phases: haltingly as a teenager; in great heart-wrenching waves as a missionary and then later as a young parent. Even now, as a middle-aged fat man, it settles on me from time to time and makes me weepy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, as the poet says, confronting my debt to my mother is not the most disturbing part of this. Rather, it&rsquo;s the realization that I have actually felt (at least sometimes) that my pitiful expressions of gratitude to her were enough to make us even.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And even more disturbing, I find that I sometimes think the same way about what I owe to God. I go on as if my sporadic temple attendance and my pretty-good personal prayers and my hit-and-miss family nights are enough to make us even; that these &ldquo;lanyards&rdquo; I offer to God are a sufficient trade for Eternal Life and Glory and &ldquo;all that [the] Father hath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Matthew chapter 19 we are introduced to a rich young man who came to the Lord and asked, &ldquo;What good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?&rdquo; Now, note the question: he was looking for one thing to add to his to-do list that would put him over the top. The Lord answered, &ldquo;Keep the commandments.&rdquo; The young man replied that he had kept them all his life. (It&rsquo;s interesting that the Lord makes no comment on the absurdity of that claim; He just let that slide. Perhaps because he knew that a better teaching moment was about to present itself.) And then the young man asked a question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was not an ordinary question. This was the kind of question that changes everything; the kind of question where everything is one way before you ask but everything is forever different after you ask, like, &ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Does this dress make me look fat?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Teacher, how long does this paper have to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question was, &ldquo;What lack I yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, clearly, our young man had no idea what he was asking. Remember, he&rsquo;s just looking for a task, completely oblivious to the gift that he&rsquo;s about to receive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior told him, &ldquo;If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor.&rdquo; Some have been tempted to read this as an instruction that is normative for the Church; as a new commandment for all disciples to sell everything they have, give it to the poor, and live under vows of poverty. But the context as given by every gospel writer who tells this story makes it clear that that is not at all what is going on here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rich young man, with his &ldquo;salvation-is-a-to-do-list&rdquo; mentality, had naively asked for a to-do-list item. &ldquo;What lack I?&rdquo; But as sometimes happens, rather than answering the question we have asked, the Lord answers the question we <em>should </em>have asked. The Savior treats the question as a request for a personal diagnosis and a specific prescription: &ldquo;What lack <em>I</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gospel of Mark adds a dimension to the Savior&rsquo;s response: &ldquo;Then Jesus beholding him loved him.&rdquo;<sup>17</sup> Before the Lord answered him, He paused and &ldquo;beheld&rdquo; him and was filled with love for him. I can almost hear, through the white space on the page, the Lord thinking, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any idea what you&rsquo;re asking, do you? But if you can somehow understand my answer, it could change everything for you.&rdquo; He <em>beheld</em> him; He sized him up; He discerned his heart. Then with no motivation but love, He gave him not a new item for his to-do list, but a penetrating diagnosis of what this particular young man needed to <em>over</em>come in order to <em>be</em>come what he could: &ldquo;If <em>thou</em> wilt be perfect, [you need to conquer your addiction to riches and status and things, so] go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor.&rdquo; A tailor-made prescription based on the Savior&rsquo;s all-knowing diagnosis of what was holding <em>this </em>young man back.</p>
<p>We do not know if the young man got the point but could not endure the white hot heat of this kind of introspection, or if he missed the point and saw it as an item for his to-do list that was just too costly. Either way, &ldquo;he went away sorrowful,&rdquo; apparently unwilling to take the necessary step forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What lack I?&rdquo; is a bold question when asked to the omniscient God for He surely knows the answer. There will be no &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re doing fine.&rdquo; Indeed, the answer may knock the wind out of us. After all, &ldquo;If men come unto me,&rdquo; the Lord said through the prophet Moroni, &ldquo;I will show unto them their weakness.&rdquo;<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;I thought we were talking about a way to feel the good feelings of the Spirit when it&rsquo;s been awhile since I&rsquo;ve felt them. I don&rsquo;t want more attention on my weaknesses. That sounds awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well it can be awful&mdash;for a moment. But this is where the &ldquo;good news&rdquo; kicks in. Ether 12:27 says, &ldquo;If men come unto me, I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble&rdquo;&mdash;and this is a hugely important point. If in this vulnerable moment when our weakness is revealed to us, we react with resistance, if we try to rationalize it or to blame someone else, if we respond by trying to point out all the reasons why this should not be held against us, we will close the door--just like the rich young man did--on the miracle that God is preparing. &ldquo;For if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heaven gets excited when we humbly ask, &ldquo;What lack I?&rdquo; because Heavenly Father knows that it means we are putting ourselves in position for the grace of Christ to make us able to overcome something that&rsquo;s been holding us back. Too often, Latter-day Saints conceive of the grace of Christ as something that is only available to us once we have conquered our weaknesses, as if it were a prize to be earned rather than a gift heaven is eager to send to any who sincerely seek it. As Amy Grant has recently put it [not that I like to get my doctrine from pop radio&mdash;but this time they got it right] &ldquo;The honest cries of breaking hearts, are better than a hallelujah sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s be clear on one point: no matter how far behind the person sitting next to you&mdash;or the bishop or the stake president&mdash;you think you are, you must remember that we do not come to Christ as bishops or stake presidents. We don&rsquo;t come as Republicans or Democrats; we don&rsquo;t come as men or women; we don&rsquo;t come as farmers or teachers. We come as sinners and beggars, &ldquo;relying wholly on the merits of him who is mighty to save.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely asking the Lord to reveal to you what is holding you back; asking Him to make clear the personal change that will make the most difference will activate the grace of Jesus Christ&mdash;His enabling power, which provides &ldquo;strength and assistance to do good works which [we] would otherwise not be able to maintain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bound up in that invitation for God to give us a personal diagnosis is both the painful revelation of our lack, and the very gifts of God that will allow us to overcome it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely asking, &ldquo;What lack I?&rdquo; can be a glorious opportunity. It will give you a decision to make. And faith is a decision.</p>
<p>But make no mistake. It won&rsquo;t necessarily be easy or pleasant or convenient. And Satan will certainly field a task-force to shut you down. He is nothing if not predictable. He will mount the usual campaign: &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t change. You can&rsquo;t change. You shouldn&rsquo;t have to change.&rdquo; But those are lies born of desperation. Do not believe them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You, through the grace of Christ, can beat the very things that have plagued you and held you back. There&rsquo;s a wonderful little moment in 1 Chronicles where we learn that David&rsquo;s army has been saved at the last minute when God caused a river to break through its banks and flood out the enemy. In gratitude, David gives God a new title: he calls him Baal-perez. The King James Version unfortunately leaves the title untranslated. It means &ldquo;God of the Breakthrough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith is a decision and there is a breakthrough headed your way, if you will ask for it.</p>

</p>
<p>Ever since I was very young I have enjoyed the sound and taste and texture of words. I have wonderful memories of my mother reading children&rsquo;s books and poetry to us, and later of our family sitting around the kitchen table, doing the &ldquo;Word Power&rdquo; section in the <em>Reader&rsquo;s Digest</em>, testing our knowledge of the 20 words provided each month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize there are times&ndash;&ndash;especially at the end of a semester&ndash;&ndash;after reading, writing, and hearing so many words you may be tempted to add your voice to that of Eliza Doolittle in the classic motion picture <em>My Fair Lady</em> when she states emphatically, &ldquo;Words, words, words, I&rsquo;m so sick of words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there are moments when words seem to get in the way or when we lament their inadequacy, they are nevertheless a very important part of our lives. Because we hear, read, and speak words so often, we may take them for granted. However, these unique packages of sounds and written symbols are vital for our education and success both temporally and spiritually.&nbsp; They help us define ourselves and the world around us. They help us establish and nurture relationships. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words have power to trigger emotions, stimulate thoughts, and stir us to action. They can elicit joy, soothe a troubled mind, bring relief to the suffering and engender gratitude. We may have blissfully chanted in elementary school, &ldquo;Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me.&rdquo; But that is just not true. Words can have a devastating effect. Words said to or about someone can ruin a reputation, crush hopes, inflict pain or bring tears of despair. As Elder Jeffry R. Holland quoted in a recent General Conference, &ldquo;The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh: but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Tongue of Angels,&rdquo; Ensign, May 2007, 16).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words, written or spoken, can linger with us for years, bringing back thoughts or feelings to cheer or discourage, to remind or to counsel. As we sing in church, &ldquo;O the kind words we give shall in memory live and sunshine forever impart.&rdquo; It is not uncommon to hear people say: &ldquo;My father always said&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;My mother used to tell me&hellip;&rdquo; followed by some useful wisdom that has been important in their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such memories of Jacob&rsquo;s words spoken about eternal life and the joy of the Saints prompted Enos to prayerfully seek a remission of his sins, and the recollection of his father&rsquo;s words concerning the mission and redemptive power of the Savior caused Alma the Younger to cry out to the Lord for mercy in the midst of his spiritual anguish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes words are just fun to say. Tongue twisters fall into this category, my favorite being:&nbsp; &ldquo;A tutor who tooted the flute tried to tutor two tutors to toot, Said the two to the tutor is it harder to toot? Or to tutor two tutors to toot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Seuss was a master of using words in ways that have delighted people for years. Who does not enjoy reading aloud or listening to infectious cadences such as these from <em>The Cat in the Hat: </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can hold up the cup</p>
<p>And the milk and the cake!</p>
<p>I can hold up these books!</p>
<p>And the fish on a rake!</p>
<p>I can hold the toy ship</p>
<p>And a little toy man!</p>
<p>And look!</p>
<p>With my tail I can hold a red fan!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have been taught, as I was, that there are &ldquo;magic words;&rdquo; not &ldquo;Hocus Pocus or &ldquo;Open Sesame,&rdquo;<em> </em>but &ldquo;please, thank you, and you&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo; These simple words express a thoughtfulness and civility that continue to be important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words come in many sizes. Some of the smallest can make the biggest difference. I&rsquo;ll be eternally grateful that my wife&rsquo;s response to my proposal of marriage was a three-letter word and not one of the two-letter variety! &ldquo;If&rdquo; is a small word with often major implications. &ldquo;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&rdquo; is a long word with relatively minor implications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Job exclaimed, &ldquo;How forcible are right words!&rdquo; (Job 6:25) And in Proverbs we read, &ldquo;A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver&rdquo; (Proverbs 25:11). Sometimes written or spoken words are not the &ldquo;right words&rdquo; nor are they &ldquo;fitly spoken.&rdquo; When words are misused, the results can be either comical or disastrous depending on the situation. Some misuses are called malapropisms, after the character Mrs. Malaprop from the play <em>The Rivals </em>who, during the play, uttered in all seriousness such phrases as: &ldquo;&hellip;she&rsquo;s as headstrong as an allegory on the banks of the Nile.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;He can tell you the perpendiculars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing we&rsquo;re all guilty of having occasionally used words in the wrong way. Sometimes words have layers of meaning that result in unintended communication. Consider the following headlines:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police begin campaign to run down jaywalkers&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two convicts evade noose, jury hung&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or the following announcements gleaned from bulletins of various churches:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For those of you who have children and don&rsquo;t know it, we have a nursery downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Potluck supper Saturday at 5:00 p.m. &ndash; prayer and medication to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Low Self-esteem Support Group will meet Thursday at 7 p.m. Please use the back door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The youth group will be presenting Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet in the cultural hall Friday at 7 p.m. The congregation is invited to attend this tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And every missionary who has had to learn a foreign language has numerous stories of words misused such as the time in Brazil my companion vigorously explained that those who refused to keep the commandments would become <em>bandidos</em> or &ldquo;bandits&rdquo; from the presence of God when he meant to say <em>banidos</em> or &ldquo;banished&rdquo;<em> </em>from His presence. The investigator must have wondered what type of God we represented!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wise choice of words and the order in which they are arranged has produced magnificent prose and marvelous poetry by authors who have enriched our language and our lives. These words can invite us to think more broadly, feel more deeply, to see with more clarity and to wrestle more successfully with this mortal experience. Through such words we can become acquainted with other cultures and other times. Such words can be a window opening on an ever-expanding view of life or a mirror in which we can see into the depths of our own souls. They can express noble thoughts and present vivid descriptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dylan Thomas, in one of my favorite poems entitled Fern Hill, evokes the magic and wonder of childhood. Allow to read a few excerpts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And honored among wagons I was prince of the apple towns</p>
<p>And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves</p>
<p>Trail with daisies and barley</p>
<p>Down the rivers of the windfall light.</p>
<p>And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves</p>
<p>Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,</p>
<p>And the Sabbath rang slowly in the pebbles of the holy streams</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few words from the section on Solitude in Henry David Thoreau&rsquo;s <em>Walden</em> invite us to feel and see and hear what the author felt, saw, and heard; to share his experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a delicious evening, when the whole body is one sense, and imbibes delight through every pore&hellip; As I walk along the stony shore of the pond in my shirt-sleeves, though it is cool as well as cloudy and windy&hellip;all the elements are unusually congenial to me. The bullfrogs trump to usher in the night, and the note of the whip-poor-will is borne on the rippling wind from over the water. Sympathy with the fluttering alder and poplar leaves almost takes away my breath; yet, like the lake, my serenity is rippled but not ruffled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all the descriptions and shared experiences are so pleasant. The words that make up the novel <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em> bring us face to face with the realities of war and help us sense the terrible price, physically, psychologically, and emotionally, that war exacts. Towards the end of the novel, the narrator, after having us see several years of the horrific experiences of war through his eyes, expresses the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am young, I am twenty years old; yet I know nothing of life but despair, death, fear, and fatuous superficiality cast over an abyss of sorrow. I see how peoples are set against one another, and in silence, unknowingly, foolishly, obediently, innocently slay one another&rdquo; (p. 263).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other memorable words may be less visually descriptive but equally powerful in their message: For example, in <em>Hamlet</em>, Shakespeare has Polonius share the following advice with his son, Laertes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This above all: to thine own self be true,</p>
<p>And it must follow, as the night the day,</p>
<p>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s famous Gettysburg Address concludes with simple, yet moving words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &hellip; we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain&ndash;&ndash;that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of&ndash;&ndash;and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph Smith&rsquo;s prose in the account of the First Vision found in the Pearl of Great Price carries the straightforward ring of truth: &ldquo;For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it&hellip;&rdquo; (JS-H 1:25)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often words have interesting origins that deepen and add a certain heft to their meaning.&nbsp;For instance, &ldquo;seminary&rdquo; comes from the Latin <em>seminarium</em>, meaning a seed plot or a piece of ground in which plants are sown to be afterwards transplanted. This literally has come to pass in the Church when we think of all the Seminary students who have been transplanted to locations in hundreds of nations around the earth as missionaries preaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;edify&rdquo; comes originally from the Latin roots aedes, meaning a dwelling or temple, and facere meaning to make. Therefore, &ldquo;edify&rdquo; relates to building a temple and means to build or strengthen spiritually. When we consider that we are called temples of God the word &ldquo;edify&rdquo;<em> </em>resonates even more richly with us as Latter-day Saints. &ldquo;Enthusiasm&rdquo; comes from combining <em>en</em>,<em> </em>meaning &ldquo;in,&rdquo; and <em>theos</em>, meaning &ldquo;God&rdquo; and is defined as &ldquo;to be inspired by a god.&rdquo; What a blessing then, to be truly enthused as we go from day to day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>King Benjamin was certainly aware of the importance of words and their potential for strengthening people spiritually. As he stood trembling with old age on the tower constructed on the temple grounds in Zarahemla and began his marvelous address, he said: &ldquo;&hellip;for I have not commanded you to come up hither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view&rdquo; (Mosiah 2:8).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in his sermon he counseled his people to watch their thoughts and words as well as their deeds (Mosiah 4:30). The people believed the words King Benjamin spoke and that led to changed hearts and lives, illustrating the principle taught in Alma 31:5: &nbsp;&ldquo;And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just&mdash;yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them&mdash;therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a sobering statement about our use of words with regards to other people, the Lord taught in the Sermon on the Mount and reiterated to the Nephites: &ldquo;And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council and whosoever shall say, thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire&rdquo; (Matthew 5:22 &amp; 3 Nephi 12:22).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior underscored the care we should take in choosing our words when he warned, &ldquo;I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment&rdquo; (Matthew 12:36). As the Savior explained: &ldquo;&hellip;those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart&hellip;&rdquo; (Matthew 15:18)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing we all have page after page of idle, and not so idle, words&ndash;&ndash;perhaps spoken thoughtlessly or carelessly&ndash;&ndash;that we would like erased before that day of judgment. Elder Holland taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with this realization of the power and sanctity of words that I wish to caution us, if caution is needed, regarding how we speak to each other and how we speak of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul put it candidly, but very hopefully. He said to all of us: &lsquo;Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but [only] that which is good &hellip; [and] edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our words, like our deeds, should be filled with faith and hope and charity&hellip;With such words, spoken under the influence of the Spirit, tears can be dried, hearts can be healed, lives can be elevated, hope can return, confidence can prevail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like all gifts &lsquo;which cometh from above&rsquo; words are &lsquo;sacred, and must be spoken with care, and by constraint of the Spirit&rsquo;&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Tongue of Angels,&rdquo; Ensign, May 2007).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we compare the words we give to others and the words we receive from them to gifts we soon realize that they come in a variety of wrappings. Some words are wrapped in love or encouragement; some are wrapped in ridicule, some in impatience or anger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words wrapped in love can be unwrapped with hope and joy. Those wrapped in anger, impatience or ridicule, when opened, can inflict pain, humiliation, or spark a desire for retaliation. We would be wise to pause from time to time and weigh our words carefully, reflecting on the impact they may have on others. What is their effect when unwrapped in the mind and in the heart? Do they edify or build spiritually? Or do they tear down and destroy? Do they hurt? Or heal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the words we say or write there are other words we should consider for a moment; these are the words that <em>should have been s</em>poken or written; words we thought of saying, planned to say, perhaps were even prompted or inspired to say but that remained stillborn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you may recall the old black-and-white movie <em>A Wonderful Life</em>, which allows an individual to see how important his life is to those around him and how things would have been much worse if he had not continued to live. It may be instructive for each of us if we were somehow able to view how our life and the lives of others would have been different if the unexpressed words of love, gratitude, counsel and commendation we thought of saying, even intended to say or write, had actually been shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happiness, encouragement, and comfort would have been added if we had made the effort? I&rsquo;m afraid there are times when we think of making a phone call, sending a text, note, or letter but we get busy, we forget, we get lazy, or we convince ourselves that it won&rsquo;t really matter. I can&rsquo;t help but think that there are many such words we should have said, but didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President David O. McKay once taught:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, I am afraid too many of us are like that Scotsman&hellip;who had lost his wife by death. His neighbor called on him to give comfort to him, saying what a good neighbor his wife had been, how thoughtful of others she had been, and what a good wife she had been to Jock, who was mourning her death. Jock answered: &lsquo;Aye, Tammas, Janet was a guid woman, a guid neighbor as you say&hellip;She was, aye, a guid true wifey tae me, and I cam&rsquo; near tellin&rsquo; her sae aince or twice&rsquo; (Oct. 1968 General Conference).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should be quick and sincere with words of love and comfort, commendation and appreciation. The Duke of Wellington, the general who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, was asked near the end of his life if he would do anything differently if he could go back. He replied, &ldquo;I should have given more praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honest praise warms and cheers the soul. Praise, however, should not be confused with flattery, which is one misuse of the wonderful gift of words. There are other ways to misuse words. Sherem, Nehor, and Korihor in the Book of Mormon employed words, often very skillfully, to deceive, lead people away from the truth and entice them to sin. There are many in today&rsquo;s world who do the same. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vaclav Havel, Czech playwright, poet and politician, pointed out, &ldquo;Words that electrify society with their freedom and truthfulness are matched by words that mesmerize, deceive, inflame&hellip;beguile, words that are harmful&mdash;lethal, even&rdquo; (Acceptance speech, German Booksellers Association Peace Prize, Oct. 1989). It is important to use words to express truth. The scriptures teach: &ldquo;Wo unto the liar, for he shall be thrust down to hell&rdquo; (2 Nephi 9:34).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith deepened our understanding of the power of words when he taught, &ldquo;It is by words &hellip; [that] every being works when he works by faith. God said, &lsquo;Let there be light: and there was light.&rsquo; Joshua spake, and the great lights which God had created stood still. Elijah commanded, and the heavens were stayed for the space of three years and six months, so that it did not rain&hellip; All this was done by faith. &hellip;Faith, then, works by words; and with [words] its mightiest works have been, and will be, performed&rdquo;(Lectures on Faith, 72-73).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other scriptural examples of words wrapped in faith include the brother of Jared, who &ldquo;said unto the mountain Zerin, Remove&mdash;and it was removed&rdquo; (Ether 12:30). Nephi taught his brothers, &ldquo;Now ye know that Moses was commanded of the Lord to do that great work and ye know that by his word the waters of the Red Sea were divided hither and thither&hellip;&rdquo; (1 Nephi 17:26).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scriptures have many examples of the great power of the Savior&rsquo;s words. When a storm raged on the Sea of Galilee, frightening his disciples, the Savior &ldquo;arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased and there was a great calm&rdquo; (Mark 4:39). And, standing before the tomb of his friend who had been dead for four days, the Savior &ldquo;cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth&hellip;&rdquo; (John 11:43-44).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are exhorted to &ldquo;feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do&rdquo; (2 Nephi 32:5). We read in Psalms: &ldquo;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path&rdquo; (Psalm 119:105). To obtain this instruction and light is one reason it is so important for us to study the scriptures each day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of the scriptures, the Savior told Joseph Smith, &ldquo;These words are not of men nor of man, but of me&hellip;&rdquo; And, as we read and hear these words, the Savior explained, &ldquo;&hellip;you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words&rdquo; (D&amp;C 18:36). We are told to treasure up in our minds &ldquo;continually the words of life&rdquo; (D&amp;C 84:85). &ldquo;For,&rdquo; as the Savior taught, &ldquo;you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God&rdquo; (D&amp;C 84:44).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Holland has encouraged students of the gospel &ldquo;to read more slowly and more carefully&hellip;to ponder, to examine every word, every scriptural gem&hellip;to hold it up to the light and turn it, look and see what&rsquo;s reflected and refracted there&hellip;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Students Need Teachers to Guide Them,&rdquo; CES Broadcast, June 1992).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the most important words we receive are inspired words wrapped in authority and power. Our patriarchal blessings are examples of such words. They should be read and reread, studied and pondered. Sometimes we receive other inspired blessings; we hear the words spoken and feel the Spirit of the message but then go about our busy lives hoping the words will take effect but never thinking about them again. Perhaps it would be well to write down and review some of the words we receive in such blessings.&nbsp; Elder Richard G. Scott taught: &ldquo;&hellip;the practice of writing down inspired ideas invites additional revelation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it is important to note that the essential, saving ordinances that are part of our path to eternal life are not just actions but words as well. The physical act of an individual, even with proper authority, immersing someone in water without the words: &ldquo;Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, amen&rdquo; would not constitute a baptism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words that bestow upon us the gift of the Holy Ghost as well as the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods are brimming with eternal possibility as are those far reaching and glorious words, spoken in the holy temples, that seal us together as husband and wife, and allow for the creation of eternal families. There are times when it is words that enable us to continue along the path to eternal life. Those who have received their temple endowments will know how essential certain words are, and will be, in allowing us to return to the presence of the Father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very significant that in the gospel of John, in the Book of Revelation, and in the Doctrine and Covenants, Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, is called the Word, even the Word of God. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). &ldquo;For in the beginning was the Word, even the Son, who is made flesh, and sent unto us by the will of the Father. And as many as believe on his name shall receive of his fullness&hellip;even immortality and eternal life, through his grace&rdquo; (JST John 1:16). &ldquo;Therefore in the beginning the Word was, for he was the Word, even the messenger of salvation&rdquo; (D&amp;C 93:8).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Word,&rdquo; translated from the Greek into English, is &ldquo;logos.&rdquo; The way it is used in the book of John and in the book of Revelation means &ldquo;the divine expression.&rdquo; (See Strong&rsquo;s Concordance John 1:1-3) Christ, therefore, is the divine expression, the messenger of salvation. One way the Savior is &ldquo;the divine expression&rdquo; is that he taught the divine doctrine of His Father. Whether as the premortal Jehovah, the mortal Jesus, or the resurrected Lord, the Savior gave expression to the doctrines and principles of the eternal gospel that can lead us to immortality and eternal life and a return to the Father&rsquo;s presence. He explained, &ldquo;My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me&rdquo; (John 7:16) and he taught the Nephites the &ldquo;words which I am commanded of the Father to speak unto you&hellip;&rdquo; (3 Nephi 17:2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is also &ldquo;the divine expression&rdquo; in that He is the perfect embodiment of all the attributes of godliness, thus by His actions as well as His words He was and is the expression of what is means to be a God. Jesus Christ is also called the &ldquo;messenger of the covenant&rdquo; (3 Nephi 24:1) and &ldquo;the mediator of the new covenant&rdquo; (D&amp;C 107:19). In these roles He established and articulated both the old and the new covenants, or testaments, and through the words of these covenants helped explain our relationship with and our duty to God and the eternal possibilities they offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus is also our Advocate with the Father. &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father&rdquo; (D&amp;C 110:4). An advocate is one who intercedes on behalf of another, who pleads their cause. As our advocate with the Father and the mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ not only teaches and exemplifies the words the Father has commanded Him to speak, but He uses words to make intercession in our behalf with a loving and powerful eternal eloquence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We read in the Doctrine and Covenants: &ldquo;Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him&mdash;Saying: Father behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed&hellip; Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life&rdquo; (D&amp;C 45:3-5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, the Word of God, does perfectly all those things that lesser words can do to bless us on our journey to eternal life. Among other things, He gives direction and hope, expresses love, encourages, illuminates, heals, comforts, and reproves. Shortly before his death, the prophet Lehi spoke earnestly to his sons: &ldquo;I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life&hellip;&rdquo; (2 Nephi 2:28).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>May we be faithful unto the Savior&rsquo;s words and choose eternal life. May the words we read and write and speak lead us, and those with whom we communicate, to Him who is the Word that we may one day hear Him speak the words of joyful invitation: &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant&hellip;enter thou into the joy of thy Lord&rdquo; (Matthew 25:23).</p>

<p>My brothers and sisters of the BYU-Idaho family, I seek your tolerance and your prayers with my efforts this day. Many of you, especially my noon-hoops associates and the Department of Geology know me well&ndash;&ndash;my strengths and my many weaknesses. It is my prayer that heaven will accept my offering this day and the message shared will allow the Spirit to communicate that which is needed for each individually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of my love for science, I need to share a brief comment with you regarding challenges that might be perceived to exist for those who choose to spend their life&rsquo;s work in a field of science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the brightest minds available among our students are desperately needed to mitigate existing and pending financial challenges, we also need those blessed with an aptitude for science to respond to the stirrings they feel within to become the new surgeons, geneticists, psychologists, engineers, geologists, and so on. There is a tremendous outpouring of knowledge being revealed upon the earth today, and we need individuals who know how to rely upon the promptings of the Spirit to tackle challenges that will continue to plague mankind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A marvelous blessing came into my life when Elder David B. Haight of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles emphatically taught our faculty that &ldquo;we do not have a problem we can&rsquo;t solve.&rdquo; During that experience, the Spirit communicated to me that I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about finding out if apparent conflicts in science and religion could be reconciled or not. They can. We simply have to press forward, leaning upon the Spirit, never trusting to our own devices, knowing that all things are known to the great Creator and will be revealed as is needed to bless mankind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally, students have confided in me that they feel looked down upon for seeking knowledge and possibly a career in the sciences because of perceived conflicts between science and religion. To the student body and to my dear colleagues who teach and advise students in disciplines outside of the sciences, please allow all students the freedom to consider careers in science without feeling undue pressures that they might somehow be going against teachings of the Church. As in all departments on this campus, they will be watched over by individuals with great faith and unwavering testimonies that will guide them in pursuit of truth and their careers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today is Valentine&rsquo;s Day, one of my favorite events of the year because it helps me take a more active role in showing my love and appreciation to my sweetheart. Knowing for months that this would be the day for my talk, my thoughts have been directed to share with you how developing our faith is integral to our ability to love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the Savior and our current prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, each of us likely has many personal examples in our lives that have showed us how to love. I&rsquo;m grateful today to have in attendance with me some of those who have blessed my life, allowing me to see their example of how to love and minister to others in the manner taught by Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recorded in Matthew, we read how one of the Pharisees, a lawyer, approached Christ &ldquo;tempting him,&rdquo; asking: &ldquo;Master, which is the great commandment in the law?&rdquo; to which Jesus responded:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou Shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>With all the laws, commandments, rules, etc. that governed the people during those times, it is significant to me our Lord taught that the most important thing we could do in this life would be to love our God with all the energy of our being, and to love our neighbors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon, Nephi bears testimony of a doctrine that is central to my message today. Nephi enters his father&rsquo;s tent and hears these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem. For Behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of my forefathers &hellip; Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records and bring them down hither into the wilderness.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup><em> <br /></em></p>
<p>Father Lehi then explains to Nephi that he has already talked with his other sons about the task of returning to Jerusalem to get the plates. I can imagine their response being something like this: &ldquo;Father, it wasn&rsquo;t a dream, you were having heat stroke. You don&rsquo;t really want us to go back there. You said we had to leave or we would be killed. If God really wanted us to have the records he would have told us to get them before we left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrast the brothers' response with that of Nephi: &ldquo;&hellip; I will&zwj; go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments&zwj; unto the children of men, save he shall prepare&zwj; a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reviewing these points, we see that we are commanded to love God and our neighbors and we know with a surety that God does not give commandments without a way prepared to obey that commandment. I like to think that Nephi&rsquo;s response, as compared to his brothers&rsquo;, is related to their faith or lack of faith. Nephi&rsquo;s willingness to go back to the house of Laban was not based on his military training or skills in defensive combat; his willingness to go was based on his faith in God, trusting that while on God&rsquo;s errand, they would be sustained and accomplish whatever they were commanded to do. Nephi did not know how they would do it, but his faith was sufficient to know that they could do it and would be successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more ancient commandment was given unto our first parents Adam and Eve: &ldquo;Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup> In recent times, the prophets of our church have continued to echo the importance of the marriage commandment. Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught this lesson in the October 2008 General Conference:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scriptures declare that &ldquo;it is lawful that [a man] should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation.&rdquo;<sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>Another affirms that &lsquo;the man [is not] without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.&rsquo;<sup>&nbsp;</sup>Thus, marriage is not only an exalting principle of the gospel; it is a divine commandment.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Since the time of Adam and Eve, the commandment and the importance of marriage has been taught and continues to be taught today. As a people, we are grateful to have the assurance from Nephi that commandments from God come with a warranty. He will prepare a way for us to obey that commandment. We don&rsquo;t have to wonder if we can find a spouse; it is incumbent upon us to develop sufficient faith to enable us to continue forward knowing we can obey this commandment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of us have heard the scripture: &ldquo;Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup> Could that verse also be interpreted to read that &ldquo;Adam fell <em>in love with Eve</em> that men might be?&rdquo; Elder Gerrit Gong of the Seventy explained that to have joy means: &ldquo;to be genuinely happy, in an eternal sense.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup> I can testify to you that in my life, those moments of greatest joy are intimately intertwined with my hope of an eternal family and eternal relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon, Alma 31-32, there is a masterful lesson presented on learning to believe. In our discussion today, I use faith and belief interchangeably; hence lessons about learning to believe also apply to learning how to have faith. Both are gifts from God. Alma and a small group, including two of his sons, visited a people known as Zoramites. These Zoramites were dissenters, once having the gospel but had fallen away, living in a state described as &ldquo;perverting the ways of the Lord in very many instances.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma observed that the people built synagogues where only one day a week, the town&rsquo;s people gathered and attempted to worship God in a very unfamiliar manner. Those who were in the synagogues were so full of pride that the poor among them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;were cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness of their apparel&mdash;Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness, &hellip;esteemed by their brethren as dross, &hellip; poor as to things of the world; and also &hellip; poor in heart.&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>The irony here is that it was this group of the poor who actually performed the manual labor to build the synagogues and were then banned from using them. Those who were poor approached Alma, seeking his help to know how they might worship God when they were not allowed into the synagogues. Alma was quick to teach them of the false concepts they held with respect to only worshiping in the synagogues and only worshiping God one day a week. Alma then taught this beautiful lesson on faith:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe. Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Here on our campus, I&rsquo;ve heard similar comments applied to dating. Sometimes you sweet sisters won&rsquo;t accept an invitation to go out with a young man who doesn&rsquo;t have all the physical attractiveness of the latest heartthrob unless there is a sign from heaven. Of equal concern, some young men try to convince you innocent sisters that you really should go out with them, and on the second date accept their marriage proposal because they have received revelation for you since they are so much more in tune with the Spirit after having served their mission and you may still be learning how it all works. Both are problems. In verse 21, Alma teaches:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now as I said concerning faith&mdash;faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Consider this verse with respect to dating, courting, and marriage. You and I have the witness of living prophets testifying that it is our Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan for each to find an eternal partner. Hence, we know that we will be blessed and our lives enriched and filled with joy if we will find our spouse. We must have hope that there is a person out there for each of us even if we can&rsquo;t yet see them. Continuing with Alma&rsquo;s teachings:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, &hellip; that ye should believe, yea, even on his word. But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.&rdquo;<sup>12 <br /></sup></p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, isn&rsquo;t this similar to the way we start to fall in love? It is as if a small seed representing our ability to love is planted in our hearts, which can then grow and blossom, ever expanding. However, we also have the ability to cause the seed to die and cast out our love because of our unbelief if we are not careful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we come into this world, it has been revealed and declared by living prophets, that each person deserves to be born into a family with a loving mother and father. My parents, Rendon and Maralyn Lovell, raised seven children and literally wore out their lives in service to others and watching over, protecting, and providing for their seven children, 36 grandchildren, and eventually 70 great-grandchildren. My first recollection of loving someone is tied to these good parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That circle of love slowly expanded to my siblings who took time to invest in relationships that allowed me to love and appreciate them for the way they influenced my life and forgiving me of my many shortcomings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After high school, I came as a student to this campus primarily to play football. After a season-ending knee injury, I started thinking more seriously about life. I was blessed in many ways but two stand out. My branch president loved me and I knew it. My missionary preparation class provided the perfect setting for me to examine and strengthen my testimony of the Savior. During that year, many experiences allowed me to draw closer to my Heavenly Father, to feel of his love, and I learned to love Jesus Christ as my Savior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaving school to serve a mission, I found myself in South America, laboring in and around the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The 1970s were difficult years for that country with dangerous political instability and runaway inflation; yet, I was impressed by how much the people loved their country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our missionary tools was to build photo panels about gospel themes and then display them on portable easels in public areas. On one such occasion, in between busloads of people, I gazed upon our display focusing on a section titled &ldquo;Living Prophets&rdquo; which included a photo of then President Spencer W. Kimball, from whom I had received my mission call. This was a pivotal moment in my life as the influence of the Holy Ghost overwhelmed my soul, filling me with love and gratitude as I was taught, by the Spirit, that there really is a living prophet upon the earth and he is tasked with guiding all, who will seek Christ, on how to find their way home. From that day on, I have been blessed to love the leaders of the Church, not because of any close personal relationship I have with them; rather, I suggest that because of my faith, my heart has been blessed with the ability to love these leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Completing my full-time missionary service, my mission president gave me great counsel about dating and finding a wife. After being home only a few short weeks, I convinced my dad to allow me to return to Ricks College. Entering the library to work on a report, I went to the circulation desk for help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There my heart was stolen by a beautiful, blue-eyed, blonde, library worker. After that experience, I spent a lot of time studying in the library! Vickie had graduated with her associate degree and was thinking of moving to attend Utah State University. In my mind that was unacceptable. I had to work fast. We began dating and the rest is history. We met in July, became engaged in October and then married December 18, the day after finals. As much as I thought I loved her then, referring back to Alma&rsquo;s teachings, we had just barely planted the seed of our love. For the last 35 years, we have nurtured and watched over that seed as our love grew; first for one another and our Heavenly Father, then for children, grandchildren, and our many dear friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear young brothers and sisters, we are living in a world that continues to expand and fulfill the prophecy that there would be those who would: &ldquo;call evil good, and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!&rdquo;<sup>13</sup> Please do not be deceived! I plead with you to strictly follow the counsel from our leaders: &ldquo;Do not have any sexual relations before marriage and be completely faithful to your spouse after marriage.&rdquo;<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of what happens to the potential missionary who succumbs to the physical urges and then knowing he cannot serve unworthily, confesses to his bishop what has happened resulting in a delay, postponement, or possible disqualification of the opportunity to serve? What happens to the individuals who are waiting for that missionary to find them and lead them unto Christ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens to the couple who feel that they love each other and are planning to go to the temple and suddenly realize that because of actions committed in moments of passion they are no longer worthy to enter the Lord&rsquo;s house? Will they have the courage to see their bishops and let the Savior&rsquo;s atonement wash over them, enabling them to build their marriage on a sure foundation? Is their faith sufficient to trust that by doing what is right, everything else will work out? Please keep yourselves clean before the Lord. If you have transgressed, today is the best day to start the repentance process. Don&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last 14 years, I&rsquo;ve come to know thousands of students. Many, mostly young women, have shared with me their frustrations at being unsuccessful in their efforts to date and not seeming to have opportunities to find a spouse. I don&rsquo;t get it. Talk about a target rich environment! This campus is literally full of faithful, marvelous young people&ndash;&ndash;beautiful and talented women and handsome capable young men who yet, in many cases, do not date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To all who are doing your very best to be temple worthy and still opportunities to date and marry elude you, I pray that your faith will sustain you as you learn to &ldquo;wait upon the Lord.&rdquo; Please listen to a selection of teachings from our beloved Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;What, then, does it mean to wait upon the Lord? In the scriptures, the word&nbsp;wait&nbsp;means to hope, to anticipate, and to trust. To hope and trust in the Lord requires faith, patience, humility, meekness, long-suffering, keeping the commandments, and enduring to the end.</p>
<p>To wait upon the Lord means planting the seed of faith and nourishing it &lsquo;with great diligence, and &hellip; patience.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting upon the Lord means pondering in our hearts and &lsquo;receiv[ing] the Holy Ghost&rsquo; so that we can know &lsquo;all things what [we] should do.&rsquo; It means &lsquo;relying alone upon the merits of Christ&rsquo;&nbsp;and &lsquo;with [His] grace assisting [us, saying]: Thy will be done, O Lord, and not ours.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My thoughts turn to the Book of Mormon and the counsel that Father Lehi gave to his sons<em>: </em>&ldquo;Arise from the dust, my sons, and be men.<sup>&rdquo;16</sup><em> </em>To my young brothers here, please get over your fears, get over your toys, and any selfish habits that might be holding you back. Follow the example of the apostle Paul, who stated: &ldquo;When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.&rdquo;<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again to you my young brethren, I extend the invitation to &ldquo;arise and be men.&rdquo; For all who have found your eternal companion and have been sealed together for time and all eternity, we are thrilled for you. But please don&rsquo;t think you have reached the journey&rsquo;s end. I encourage you to look at your marriage much the same way you would your most difficult course here at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To pass any challenging course you must invest yourself completely, daily readings and exercises, group efforts (just your wife!), otherwise you will not be prepared to pass the tests and unnecessary heartache will follow. Your marriage must mean more to you than anything else, worthy of your best effort, or when life&rsquo;s tests rain upon you, and I promise you they will come, you won&rsquo;t be ready. Seek, listen, and obey the promptings of the Spirit and you will be safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If for reasons beyond your control you find yourselves without a spouse, even being faithful, I know that you will still have times of loneliness. I encourage you to develop your faith. It will sustain you as you &ldquo;wait upon the Lord&rdquo; trusting that your Heavenly Father will reward you on His timetable with all the blessings of heaven that are prepared for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last five to ten years, Vickie and I have had the opportunity of living close to and serving loved ones as they wrestled their way through the twilight years of their lives. My wife and those of her family spent many, many evenings visiting her maternal grandparents, first in their home and then in care facilities prior to their passing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon after that experience, my father suffered a series of strokes.<strong> </strong>For several years, we watched as my mother would faithfully drive the 20 or so miles from home to Rexburg each day where she would sit with my dad; read to him, show him pictures of their family, or just sit and hold his hand. Dad eventually lost the ability to express his love to mother in words, but his eyes spoke volumes as he would gaze upon her face and smile. We also saw him communicate his sorrows as he would look at mother at the end of the day and the tears would begin to flow, knowing she needed to go home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their faith in God and in the plan of salvation allowed them to live a life of service to one another and those around them, allowing them to face the debilitating effects of worn out bodies and eventually physical death, knowing that their Savior, our Savior, even the Lord Jesus Christ lived upon the earth, suffered for the sins and weaknesses of mankind and fulfilled the eternal demands of justice through His atoning sacrifice, preparing a way for you and I to be resurrected and reunited as eternal families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is my prayer that we might constantly seek the sweet companionship of the Holy Ghost who will &ldquo;teach us all things [that we must do]&rdquo;<sup>18</sup>, and that we will go forth and develop sufficient faith to love, doing all within our power to be obedient to His commandments and at the same time, exercise our faith to &ldquo;wait upon the Lord&rdquo; and trust in his love for each of us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p>This is an amazing environment and I believe you know it. I love being a small part of your lives, especially today. I speak to you this afternoon from experience. Experience that comes from the years attending college here and other universities, from wondering about what comes next, from marriage to a angel, from Church callings, from moments of service to others, from children, from living life, and from knowing there is so much to live for. Most important, experience that comes from knowing that I know I know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Growing with five children (4 daughters and one son) through their infancy and early years, into their teens and now in their married lives, with children of their own, has had a common theme. Simply stated: learn and live expectations, not demands. This puts free agency where it belongs, in our mind and heart. For example, as Michael, our only son, was considering a mission, it was not demanded, but it was expected of him. We lived and taught him the counsel offered by a prophet of God, Ezra Taft Benson, when he stated: &ldquo;Missionary service is expected from all young men&hellip;.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a prophet, citing the expectations for young men. That school of thought was a part of Michael&rsquo;s home life as he grew in the priesthood. If you ever have a chance to meet him, ask him what the Texas Houston East mission did for him and for those he taught. Great blessings come from meeting expectations of the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the expectation was always present, there were also far reaching implications. There may be extenuating circumstances where missionary service is not possible for some young men. Those circumstances need to be examined and careful consideration given before missionary service is discarded. Missionary work saves souls and provides invitation to the world to come unto Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That also includes the missionary. Many a missionary will testify of the tremendous personal maturity and growth that occurs while in the service of their fellow man. But it goes much further than the individual. Elder Robert D Hales described effects on the future generations of a missionary with this insight: &ldquo;Make certain that the great example of missionary service is a heritage you will leave your posterity.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed living to expectations carries impacts on generations unseen. Or, consider marriage in the house of the Lord: the temple. The expectation in our home, because of what Sister Mendenhall and I knew, was for all our children&ndash;&ndash;through all of their growing up antics&ndash;&ndash;to never lose sight of a covenant union for eternity. That was accompanied with a need for decisions and choices that would not put worthiness to qualify for a temple recommend ever in jeopardy. Now, a celestial marriage in everyday mortality is their job. That blissful dream requires building trust and a relationship and confidence in one another and large amounts of patience and, yes, there are expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are expectations in all we do in the gospel and in life itself. But none of those expectations are beyond us or our capabilities. Recall for a moment as Ammon and his companions were preaching the gospel to the Lamanites, they encountered many difficulties and setbacks. Listen to Ammon&rsquo;s missionary journal in the 26th chapter of Alma: &ldquo;Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you success&rdquo; (Alma 26:27).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From this perspective, the principles of the gospel and the ever-present blessings are taught and exemplified. From experiences of learning and living expectations, confidence in the promises and blessings of a loving Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ grow strong and become a foundation in all decisions and actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As parents we felt we were doing the right thing, in the right way, teaching these things to our children. By no means were we perfect parents. There were ups and downs, tests of patience, and questions about our expectations and even the expectations of gospel principles. But we pressed on. The impact? Let me share with you a card I received one Fathers Day. I keep it to remind me of many things. It reads:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, I know I was difficult, challenging, and a real pain growing up.&nbsp; But on Father&rsquo;s Day I just wanted you to know&hellip; Let&rsquo;s face it; you were no cakewalk either. Let&rsquo;s just call it even. Love, Mike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I love my son.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We parented as we believed. Confidence in expectations we learned from our parents has been passed on to our children, expecting them to see what we saw, to know what we know. Expectations that great blessings would be theirs if&ndash;&ndash;and most all of you have heard these&ndash;&ndash;if they would:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All true and known by all of us. All expectations on the pathway to strength and confidence in gospel principles, promises, and blessings. Expectations are present for each of us, everyday, in all we do in this probationary time. And yet there seems to be a void in our confidence that causes us to hesitate in accepting all that is offered to us, and all that is promised to us by a loving Heavenly Father.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I speak of accepting a direct invitation from the Lord to step up in our purpose of all we do here on this earth. That invitation is: Increase our personal confidence in what the Lord expects of us and receive those rich blessings of gospel promises. As a young man in the Aaronic Priesthood there were two Church-produced videos that greatly influenced me: <em>Johnny Lingo</em> and <em>The Windows of Heaven</em>. I watched these many, many times over the years. As this is not a topic on dating today, I&rsquo;ll leave the teachings on respect for the daughters of God until another day. So Johnny and Mahonna Lingo will have to wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to a moment in the film <em>The Windows of Heaven</em>. If you have not viewed it&ndash;&ndash;old as it is&ndash;&ndash;it is a marvelous lesson on tithes and offerings. I remember the main storyline, but the real influence in my life came from the expectation the Lord revealed through the Old Testament prophet, Malachi: &ldquo;&hellip;<em>prove me now herewith</em>, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it&rdquo; (Malachi 3:10, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Malachi was teaching of tithes and offerings, for me as a young man the words &ldquo;&hellip;prove me now herewith&hellip;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&hellip;open you the windows of heaven, and pour out a blessing that there shall not be room enough&hellip;&rdquo; to receive the blessings, became embedded deep in my mind and my heart. And even as I experienced my own growing up antics, I did not lose sight of the significance this personal invitation offered to me. If it was given for the principle of tithing, what stopped it from being applicable to all promises offered from my Heavenly Father?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prove Him herewith. Do we believe Him in all we face or just in the easy parts, the simple times, or the contented life? Remember Lehi and his family? They found the effects of accepting this invitation with the liahona. Their confidence increased when they put the principle of faith and direction into action. When they hem hawed, direction was lost and so were they (1 Nephi 16:28-29). Or the brother of Jared. He found the promise fulfilled as he described how the barges were built and how light was provided for the inside of the ships. And the windows of heaven were definitely opened to him (Ether 3:12-13).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recall Moses and the Israelites. They experienced the fruition of that invitation when coming to the shores of the Red Sea as they were fleeing the armies of the Pharaoh. Exodus 14 records: &ldquo;Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord&hellip;. And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians&rdquo; (Exodus 14:13, 31).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Closer to home, Diego Fernando Zapata, a valiant young man from Colombia, who, just this past December, reached a milestone of a one-year anniversary of being baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&ndash;&ndash;the only member in his family, anxious to prove the Lord herewith. He attends BYU-Idaho. While here, he submits missionary papers and is called to labor in Argentina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At home in Colombia, he lives four hours from the temple in Bogota. So he accepts the invitation from the Lord and proved Him herewith as he worked through efforts to attend the temple before leaving the United States. He received his own endowment, completed temple work for his grandparents, and attended endowment sessions in three different temples, all in the space of four days prior to returning to Colombia to prepare for two years of missionary service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diego is well on the path of accepting, with confidence, the invitation and promised blessings of the oath and covenant of the priesthood. Listen for the expectations and confidence in Doctrine and Covenants 84: &ldquo;For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling&hellip;all that my Father hath shall be given unto him&hellip;&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants 84:38).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expectations, brethren? Yes. Faithful and magnifying. Sisters, through the priesthood, all the Father hath is yours. The windows of heaven can be opened. Recall the young Prophet Joseph Smith. He reads the words written by James recorded in the New Testament: &ldquo;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him&rdquo; (James 1:5). Here was a young 14-year-old boy prepared and confident to respond to that very same invitation that Malachi expressed. And the windows of heaven were literally opened to him and the blessings for mankind were more than there is room to receive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I walked the same roads and towns in the Palmyra area as a young missionary. I taught the powerful principles of the Atonement that had been restored through this prophet. I watched lives changed. I witnessed the windows of heaven open up to many who accepted the fullness of the restored gospel in their lives. All as a result of a young 14-year-old boy willing to step forward with confidence in what was expected and was promised. I speak with full conviction that you too can feel the power of the Atonement in your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I extend the strongest sense of urgency to begin your own journey of finding confidence in what the Lord revealed through Malachi. Prove Him herewith. Today. Now. Elder Dallin H. Oaks explained the importance of this when he stated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Apostle Paul taught that the Lord&rsquo;s teachings and teachers were given that we may all attain &lsquo;the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&rsquo; (Eph. 4:13). This process requires far more than acquiring knowledge. It is not even enough for us to be convinced of the gospel; we must act and think so that we are converted by it. In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us to know something, the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to become something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>All that you are learning and have learned in these, your formative years and beyond, all the principles you taught in the mission field, all the facts you are absorbing in your classes here, all the discussions you have in family home evening, are not enough. We do not have the time or the luxury to merely go through the motions. The time is now to gain confidene, to actually &ldquo;Prove me herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1859, a French tightrope walker and acrobat by the name of Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Gravelet, known professionally as the Great Blondin, awed large crowds of people with aerial acrobatics as he crossed on a high wire that great gorge that makes Niagara Falls. One instance he walked half way and stopped, placed a chair on the wire, and read a book. Another crossing found him balanced on the wire as he cooked an egg. But perhaps the most widely known of his exploits involved a wheelbarrow to be pushed across the great divide on the high wire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As he began his trek, he stopped, turned to the crowd, and asked, &ldquo;Do you believe I can do this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the overwhelming response. &ldquo;We have watched you do many things and we know you can do this.&rdquo; Blondin asked again, &ldquo;You really believe I can do this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; came the confident responses from the safety of the cliff side. Blondin locked eyes with one man in particular and asked, &ldquo;You sir, do you believe I can do this?&rdquo; The man responded, &ldquo;Yes, I do. I have watched you before do many amazing things.&rdquo; To that, Blondin looked him in the eye and said to the man, &ldquo;Get in the wheelbarrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are very much like that man, who, by the way, as the story goes, did not get in the wheelbarrow. We have seen great things, we know great things, but then when it is time to respond to &ldquo;prove me now herewith&rdquo;&nbsp; we stammer and back up like the man and the wheelbarrow. We seem to be strong to profess confidence but slow to prove it herewith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I suggest three very important &ldquo;wheelbarrows&rdquo; that, for some reason, we hesitate to climb into. Wheelbarrows that seem to hold us back from being quite ready to climb into the wheelbarrow of confidence in the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First Wheelbarrow: The Simple Wheelbarrow</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your plans today and even tomorrow? Have we caused our lives to become so complex that we lose sight of the greatness that is in front of us?&nbsp; The 133rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants gives this direction: &ldquo;&hellip;that men might be made partakers of the glories which were to be revealed, the Lord sent forth the fullness of the his gospel, his everlasting covenant, reasoning in plainness and in simplicity&hellip;To prepare the weak for those things which are coming on the earth&hellip;&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants 133:57-58).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Nephi was called upon by the Lord to build a ship to carry his family across the great waters, his brothers mocked him and belittled him. They chided him, telling him he was a fool. He had never built a ship. They didn&rsquo;t help because they didn&rsquo;t believe in his acceptance of a divine call to build this ship. But Nephi did believe and began preparations to build it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi patiently explained to his brothers the great things that had occurred with their fathers and Moses as they escaped the armies of the Pharaoh. Nephi recounted to his brothers regarding fiery flying serpents sent among their fathers when they entered into a time of disbelief. In order to be saved after being bitten and poisoned by the bites, &nbsp;Nephi wrote, explaining: &ldquo;...the labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished&rdquo; (1 Nephi 17:41).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like those forefathers of Nephi, the simplest of expectations escape us. It was not a simple thing for Nephi to build a ship, but his confidence in what the Lord asked him to do was based on obedience to basic commandments. Brothers and sisters, plan for the future, but look for today. Those simple expectations of say your prayers, read your scriptures, go to church, follow the prophets, and keep the commandments, and, yes, be home by midnight or let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;curfew,&rdquo; are actually very simple if we have confidence in the promises given us and look at what we are doing in our daily lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second Wheelbarrow: The Wheelbarrow of Doing and Understanding</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in a Coordinating Council meeting last month and Elder Robert E. Chambers of the Seventy was teaching an important principle of Church administration. He cited a portion of a verse from the hymn &ldquo;Come, Come Ye Saints&rdquo;:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tis better far for us to strive,</p>
<p>Our useless cares from us to drive.</p>
<p>Elder Chambers stated, &ldquo;The more engaged we are, the less time we have for useless cares.&rdquo; Let me repeat that: &ldquo;The more engaged we are, the less time we have for useless cares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, useless cares are a part of our everyday life. Imagine if a list of useless cares were compiled, the list would be most interesting. And yet those useless cares creep in and occupy a majority of our day, week, month, even lives. It creeps into our relationships. Of course, there will be times when a useless care to one person is a priority to another. Take stock every day. What is important to me? What is important to those I associate with? How do we know? &nbsp;&nbsp;Where to begin? Consider the wisdom and teaching of President Henry B Eyring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can gain confidence that God keeps his promises by trying them. That&rsquo;s why I so appreciate those commandments to which God has attached an explicit promise. I see those commandments as school masters. And I try to put them high on my list of things to do, because I know their value for changing my heart and building my power to invest my time.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A list of important things to do? Not a list maker or keeper? Get in the wheelbarrow. Have confidence in those who have gone before you. This purpose of identifying important things is explained&nbsp; by the Chinese philosopher and reformer, Confucius:</p>
<p>I hear and I forget.</p>
<p>I see and I remember.</p>
<p>I do and I understand.</p>
<p>You are the one to decide what useless cares are. You know, no excuses, you know! Act now. That one thing right now that would strengthen your confidence in the Lord&rsquo;s promises&ndash;&ndash;put it in place of one of your useless cares. Do and understand!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third Wheelbarrow: The Wheelbarrow in the World</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preparing you to be an influence in the world in a profession you choose is a major reason you are here. You learn from those who know their way, who are professionals in your field of study. You are being prepared to take the world by storm. But this oft repeated teaching of Jesus Christ as recorded by the apostle John is never far from the lesson plans presented here at BYU-Idaho:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world and I come to thee.&nbsp; Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from evil&rdquo; (John 17:11-15).</p>
<p>This should not&ndash;&ndash;no, cannot&ndash;&ndash;be forgotten in your studies, your internships , your everyday lives, even in home evenings at BYU-Idaho. As the president of a Young Single Adult stake, it saddens me to hear members of the Church here on this great campus make a statement such as, &ldquo;It will be good to get home where I can act or do what I want.&rdquo; We can meet expectations to prove herewith now, here in this environment. Restrictions? No. Consider it a wheelbarrow. A personal commitment to a personal expectation; even personal honor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standards are set. They do not change depending what part of the United States or the world we are in. Boyd K. Packer, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: &ldquo;However out of step we may seem, however much the standards are belittled, however much others yield, we will not yield, we cannot yield.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I counsel you: do no get in the wheelbarrow of the world. Jump into the world in the world. Do what you have worked so hard to do. Take it by storm, but never forget President Packer&rsquo;s statement. So many wheelbarrows, so little time today:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Simple Wheelbarrow</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Doing and Understanding Wheelbarrow</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wheelbarrow in the World</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope now you can relate, as I did in my youth, that &ldquo;&hellip;prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and&nbsp; pour out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it&rdquo; is the invitation if we will accept it. Understanding why and what is expected is an integral part of that invitation. I close with President James E. Faust teaching us:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are willing to pay the price for success, good things, even great things, <em>can</em> happen to you, even beyond your fondest dreams and expectations! Often we do not have even a glimpse of our potential for happiness and accomplishment in this life and in eternity Many of us do not have a full awareness of what we really know. Even though we have been taught the gospel, we may not be fully aware of what the Lord has put in our &lsquo;inward parts&rsquo; and written in our hearts.<a href="http://classic.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=29768d00422fe010VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;vgnextoid=f318118dd536c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD#footnote16" target="_self"> </a>&hellip;you are heirs to great promises.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Will you accept the Lord&rsquo;s expectations with courage and confidence? Will you accept the invitation to prove Him herewith and open the windows of heaven in your life? It is my hope, deep in my heart, that you do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<script type="text/javascript"></script>
</p>
<p>As students at Brigham Young University-Idaho, you are constantly being challenged to remember things: dates in history, formulas, information delivered in lectures and through reading your textbooks&ndash;&ndash;even church appointments, doctor&rsquo;s appointments, and a roommate&rsquo;s or spouse&rsquo;s birthday. Many of us have so many things to remember that we keep appointment calendars or have audio reminders on our electronic devices. Remembering is important, and a good memory can be a great advantage in an academic setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of even greater importance, a good memory is important spiritually. Each Sunday, as we partake of the sacrament, we are reminded of our covenant that we &ldquo;do always remember him.&rdquo; Furthermore, President Spencer W. Kimball once said, &ldquo;When you look in the dictionary for the most important word, do you know what it is? It could be &lsquo;remember.&rsquo; Because all of [us] have made covenants&hellip;our greatest need is to remember.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as important as remembering is&ndash;&ndash;and clearly it is vital to our academic and worldly success and even to our salvation&ndash;&ndash;my message to you this afternoon is that there is also a time to forget. We read in Chapter 3 of Ecclesiastes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then skipping a few lines, we come to verse 6:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consider especially those two phrases: &ldquo;a time to lose &hellip; and a time to cast away&hellip;&rdquo; A logical question might be: what, exactly, in my life should I deliberately choose to lose, to lay aside, to cast out? There are many things: your mistakes, mistakes of others that hurt you, sins for which you have repented, lost opportunities, moments when we are selfish or unkind, even our unkind judgments of others. Too often we make ourselves miserable remembering past failures and mistakes, even lying awake at night in agony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This attitude is contrary to the advice of the Lord. In Ezekiel 18:31, we are told to &ldquo;cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed, and make you a new heart and a new spirit&hellip;&rdquo; And in Hebrews 12:1-2 we are advised to &ldquo;&hellip;lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us&hellip;looking unto Jesus&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In truth, we all make mistakes, and we all sin. If the sins are serious, the Lord has a plan for repentance that can bring us forgiveness. But we must remember that everyone who has ever lived, except the Savior Himself, has made mistakes and has sinned. Yet we sometimes feel we are worthless and inferior because of those mistakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants 58:42, the Lord has promised us that He will forgive us if we repent, and that in fact He will remember our sins no more. Unfortunately, He doesn&rsquo;t promise us that we will no longer remember our sins. If the Lord no longer remembers our past mistakes, however, we should also strive to cast them off, remembering instead the atoning sacrifice of our Savior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can learn from the example of Paul. In Philippians 3:13 he said, &ldquo;&hellip;this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before.&rdquo; Will Rogers expressed this idea this way: &ldquo;Never let yesterday use up too much of today.&rdquo; But despite the advice from the scriptures, church leaders and even psychologists, we often have difficulty forgetting past mistakes. Elder Jeffery R. Holland has said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something in us, at least in too many of us, that particularly fails to forgive and forget earlier mistakes in life&ndash;&ndash;either mistakes we ourselves have made or the mistakes of others. That is not good. It is not Christian. It stands in terrible opposition to the grandeur and majesty of the Atonement of Christ. To be tied to earlier mistakes&ndash;&ndash;our own or other people&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;is the worst kind of wallowing in the past from which we are called to cease and desist.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Let us examine two specific kinds of past sins and mistakes that we should, indeed, leave behind us: sins and mistakes made by others in the past that are still hurting us, and sins and mistakes made by ourselves in the past that are hurting us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, sins and mistakes made by others. Let&rsquo;s begin talking about this problem by examining an incident in Church history. Many of you are familiar with this story. In the year 1838, two sisters in the Church got into a squabble over who should get the cream produced by their cows. One of those sisters was Elizabeth Marsh, wife of Thomas B. Marsh, the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. President Marsh was loved, honored, and respected in the Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This disagreement grew into an argument, which just kept escalating. President Marsh took Elizabeth&rsquo;s side and got deeply involved. In the end, it resulted in President Marsh and Elizabeth leaving the Church. Nineteen years later he came back to Brigham Young and pleaded to be taken back as a Church member. By this time, however, he was a broken man who had prematurely aged and lost his health. Furthermore, all of his previous accomplishments and blessings from the Church were gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of how his life may have been better if he had chosen to leave the past behind, to let a little injustice go, to cast away a grudge, and move forward. We can find another good example of how destructive carrying a grudge can be in literature. Nineteenth-century French writer Guy de Maupassant exemplified the consequences of failing to cast out unfortunate incidents of the past in his short story, &ldquo;A Piece of String.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This story tells about an old peasant in a Norman village, Maitre Hauchecorne, who one day wanders into a public square, notices a small piece of string on the ground, picks it up and examines it, and puts it into his pocket. Unfortunately, this incident happened on the very day the mayor of the village had lost his wallet, which contained 500 francs. A witness saw Hauchecorne pick up something in area where the wallet was lost and reported him to the police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, Hauchecorne strongly denied he had taken the wallet, showing police the small piece of string in his pocket and explaining what had happened in detail. The police laughed at his story and did not believe him despite a passionate plea by Hauchecorne for his innocence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, another peasant returned the wallet to the mayor, including the money, reporting he found it along side the road. Hauchecorne was freed. However, he felt his name had been smeared, and he had been greatly wronged. &ldquo;What grieved me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;was not the thing itself, do you understand, but it was being accused of lying. Nothing does you so much harm as being in disgrace for lying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He began to obsessively go to anyone who would listen, explaining what had happened, about how he had been mistreated. Some people in the market did not believe him; others were amused at his obsession to tell and retell the story. Hauchecorne became even more obsessed, proclaiming his innocence more vociferously to anyone who would listen. Each day he added new proofs, lengthening his story. Even in his solitude, his mind was preoccupied with the injustice. Eventually, he became bitter and discouraged, and then he became ill, and then he died. He was still raving in his deathbed, repeating: &ldquo;A little bit of string&ndash;&ndash;a little bit of string. See, here it is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that Hauchecorne did not heed the counsel given in Alma 7:15: &ldquo;Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction&hellip;&rdquo; Please remember, as a philosopher once said, &ldquo;Quietly forgiving and moving on is a gift to yourself.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has someone in your past said or done something that has hurt you? Does your self-image suffer because of how you may have been treated in your growing up years? Well, there is something to be said for fresh starts. The beauty of attending church and taking the sacrament each week is the opportunity to start new by once again taking his name upon us. Furthermore, the good thing about moving away from your past and coming to the university is that no one knows that in high school you were labeled &ldquo;the shy kid&rdquo; or the &ldquo;nerd&rdquo; or the &ldquo;class clown&rdquo; or whatever else. You can change your image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twentieth-century sociologist Robert K. Merton coined the expression &ldquo;self-fulfilling prophecy&rdquo; to describe a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true, by the very terms of the prophecy itself, due to positive feedback between belief and behavior. It has both positive and negative capability.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if you sign up for a math class, then constantly remind yourself how bad you are in math, that definition of reality, accurate or not, will eventually hurt your performance in the class. Conversely, if you look in the mirror every morning and tell yourself that you are friendly, outgoing and smart, the self-fulfilling prophecy will help those concepts become true. The basis of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the theorem, &ldquo;If people define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.&rdquo; But, such a change in self-concept &ndash; and the casting off of unfortunate things others may have said about you or done to you in the past &ndash; cannot occur if you are unwilling to leave the past behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cast off the unfair, the hurtful, the stereotyping comments that have been made to you in the past. Don&rsquo;t be like the unfortunate protagonist in the short story &ldquo;A Piece of String,&rdquo; who allowed an injustice done to him by another in his past to become a bitter, acidic, life-ruining incident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that brings us to the second kind of past mistake that we should forget: mistakes made by ourselves that are still hurting us. First, let&rsquo;s realize and repeat that every one of us makes mistakes, some more grievous than others. We have all sinned. We continue to make mistakes that grieve our Father in Heaven. Sometimes a sincere apology in our personal prayers and a change of attitude and actions are all that are needed to repent and move forward. At other times, we may need to confess our sins to our bishop or other church leader to begin the repentance process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But through the atonement of Jesus Christ, our Father in Heaven has provided a way for us to be forgiven of our sins, regardless of how grievous they are. Jesus Christ suffered the penalty for our sins so we can be forgiven if we sincerely repent. As we repent and rely on His saving grace, we will be cleansed from sin. Yet we often have trouble moving on. Consider a letter to advice columnist &ldquo;Dear Abby&rdquo; last summer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Abby: In the past, I made several seriously awful decisions about guys. I also spent two years in high school off and on with a young man who only made my life dramatic and exhausting. Now that I&rsquo;m a freshman in college, I have encountered several guys I&rsquo;d love to have a relationship with, but I feel unworthy. Because of my bad decisions&hellip;I&rsquo;m worried my past will catch up with me, and they&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m still the way I was back then&hellip; Some of my friends have told me I shouldn&rsquo;t have to change who I am for &lsquo;some guy.&rsquo; Are they right? What should I do to make a connection with one of these young men?&rdquo; &mdash; Undeserving in Idaho.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Abby&rsquo;s response in part: &ldquo;I believe in the philosophy of constant self-improvement. When you improve yourself to the point that you are proud of yourself, you will attract men who have more to offer than the ones you were involved with in high school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The columnist&rsquo;s advice to improve and to move forward is sound, both morally and psychologically. Psychologists tell us that regrets and anxieties may become so great that they interfere with successful daily living. What is the alternative to putting the past behind us? In Ezekiel 33:10, the Lord answers that question: &ldquo;If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?&rdquo; Most of us would answer that question: &ldquo;Mostly in misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a 1998 conference talk, President Thomas S. Monson made it clear we shouldn&rsquo;t spend too much time worrying or regretting the past. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one phrase which should be erased from your thinking and from the words you speak aloud. It is the phrase &lsquo;If only.&rsquo; It is counterproductive and is not conducive to the spirit of healing and of peace. Rather, recall the words of Proverbs: &lsquo;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&rsquo;&rdquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Wallowing in regret may cause us to hesitate to try new things. Furthermore, anxieties can become so great and threatening that we flee from reality in order to avoid them. Depression and regret have caused some people to retreat into a fantasy world to escape. But remember that wallowing in the past is a choice. We can choose, conversely, to believe the words of Christ and in his atoning sacrifice. The scriptures give us many examples of people with clear consciences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Acts 23:1, we are told: &ldquo;And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all conscience before God until this day.&rdquo; King Benjamin, in Mosiah 2:27, said, &ldquo;&hellip;I had served you, walking with a clear conscience before God&hellip;&rdquo; and Joseph Smith, in Doctrine and Covenants 135:4, said, &ldquo;&hellip;I have a conscience void of offense towards God and towards all men&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul, King Benjamin, and Joseph Smith had clear consciences not because they were perfect, but because they had repented of their sins and had faith that the Lord forgave them and paid for their sins through the atonement. An Italian psychiatrist<sup>7</sup> said, &ldquo;without forgiveness, life is an endless cycle of resentment.&rdquo; There is nothing more draining than holding yourself or others in contempt for your past. Resentment is the posture of the powerless; forgiveness empowers us. It gives us the permission to nod at the past and turn our eyes toward the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And clearly we must keep our eyes on the future, not the past. Do you remember the Old Testament story of Lot&rsquo;s wife? Back in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Lord could no longer tolerate the deep sin and depravity in those cities, and he elected to destroy them. Because Lot and his family were among the few righteous living there, He commanded them in Genesis 19:17, &ldquo;Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, &hellip;escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a little hesitation, Lot and his family left just in time. At daybreak the morning following their escape, the cities were rained upon with brimstone and fire from the Lord. Despite the warning given to her, Lot&rsquo;s wife, the record says, &ldquo;looked back,&rdquo; (Genesis 19:26) and she was turned into a pillar of salt. President Boyd K. Packer referred to this story in an October 2010 conference address entitled &ldquo;Cleansing the Inner Vessel.&rdquo; He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;President Joseph Fielding told me of a repentant woman struggling to find her way out of a very immoral life. She asked him what she should do now. In turn, he asked her to read to him from the Old Testament the account of Lot&rsquo;s wife, who was turned to a pillar of salt. Then he asked her, &lsquo;What lesson do you gain from those verses?&rsquo; She answered, &lsquo;The Lord will destroy the wicked.&rsquo; &lsquo;No so!&rsquo; President Smith said that lesson for this repentant woman and for you is &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look back!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a personal experience a number of years ago that showed our focus should remain on future; that we must leave past mistakes behind us. Prior to becoming a journalism instructor at BYU-Idaho, I worked for many years as a professional journalist. At one newspaper in Nevada, I was a prep sports writer, assigned to cover local high schools. While covering this assignment, I became aware of a very talented 17-year-old left-handed pitcher. He could throw a fastball nearly 90 miles per hour and his curve ball appeared to fall off a table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the high school baseball season went on, he began to get the attention of professional baseball scouts. Some of his high school games had 10 or 12 scouts there, armed with their radar guns and stopwatches. When the professional baseball draft finally came around, I was not surprised that he was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first round.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still I worried a little about him. His high school had a reputation for having troubled students. I interviewed him and wrote a front-page story about his being chosen so high in the draft. He seemed likeable and optimistic. I hoped that any problems or bad influences he might have had in high school were behind him now that he faced fame and fortune as a professional baseball player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His talent did, in fact, carry him through the minor leagues rather quickly, and he was soon in the Major Leagues. However, it wasn&rsquo;t long before his name became associated with drug abuse in baseball. His performance began to wane. He was traded to other teams, and finally released in December of 1988.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On October 29, 1992, he was back in his home in Nevada. Responding to a call from a neighbor, the sheriff&rsquo;s department found him outside of his home complaining that snakes were in his home, crawling on him and biting him. Deputies attempted to subdue him by putting handcuffs and leg restraints on him. He became violent and then stopped breathing. He was taken to a local hospital. He remained on life-support systems until his death a week later. It was ruled he died of a cocaine-induced heart attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suppose I will ever know all the details of this incident. But I suspect that this young man, like Lot&rsquo;s wife, looked back and perhaps even embraced past mistakes, leading to his own destruction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I conclude my remarks about repenting, forgiving ourselves, and forgetting our past mistakes, I must add one more dimension to the topic. In addition to doing this favor for ourselves, we must also do it for others. I remember only too well some of my classmates in high school whose lives must have been made unbearable when insensitive classmates noticed idiosyncrasies and mannerisms and felt the need to give them unflattering nicknames and to pick on them and to embarrass them. Even if we are not bullies or totally insensitive, don&rsquo;t we sometimes define a person by remembering a past mistake that person has made? And married couples far too often remember the mistakes of their spouses, and, sadly, bring them up during an argument or when they feel the need to try to hurt the other person. When someone else has repented and moved on, let it go. As Elder Holland said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not right to go back and open up some ancient wound which the Son of God Himself died trying to heal. Let people repent. Let people grow. Believe that people can change and improve. Is that faith? Yes! Is it hope? Yes! Is it charity? Yes! Above all it is charity, the pure love of Christ.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We could all learn from the wise advice given by former Church President Howard W. Hunter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To dig a straight furrow, the plowman needs to keep his eyes on a fixed point ahead of him. That keeps him on a true course. If, however, he happens to look back to see where he has been, his chances of straying are increased. The results are crooked and irregular furrows&hellip;Fix your attention on your&hellip;goal[s] and never look back on your earlier problems&hellip;.&nbsp; If our energies are focused not behind us but ahead of us&ndash;&ndash;on eternal life and the joy of salvation&ndash;&ndash;we assuredly will obtain it.&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>It is my prayer that we will remember our Savior and his atonement, that he enabled us to put our past sins and mistakes behind us, and that we will heed the wise advice in Ecclesiastes and in Genesis to cast away and not look back. Whether it&rsquo;s an injustice done to us in the past by others or our own past sins and mistakes, let&rsquo;s not allow things that have happened to us yesterday destroy who we are today. Let&rsquo;s repent of our personal mistakes, and then keep our attention focused forward to a more righteous and fulfilling future. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p>Some years ago there was a bestselling book written by Robert Fulghum. The title was <em>All I Ever Really Needed to Know about Life I Learned in Kindergarten</em>. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Play fair.</p>
<p>Clean up your own mess.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take things that aren&rsquo;t yours.</p>
<p>Say you&rsquo;re sorry when you hurt somebody.</p>
<p>Wash your hands before you eat.</p>
<p>Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you go out into the world, watch for traffic, hold hands, and stick together.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Well, there is some wisdom there. Here is a picture of my wife, LaDawn, and me. She was a teacher here when we were courting. Sometimes in conversation with friends someone will make a comment about a fact that is new to me. I might say, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that. That is very interesting.&rdquo; My wife always delights in saying, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know that? Why I learned that in the fifth grade!&rdquo; The reason she says that is because I skipped the fifth grade. The teachers at my school moved six of us from the fourth grade to the sixth grade. During the year they realized their mistake and so I spent two years in the sixth grade but no time in the fifth grade&mdash;a serious gap in my education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I mention kindergarten and fifth grade for this reason: too many people are trying to solve the serious complex problems of life with a sketchy, superficial, fifth grade understanding of gospel doctrine. This is not only unwise&mdash;it is dangerous. So here is the question: Are you smarter than a fifth grader? Getting an academic education is important&ndash;&ndash;a high priority in life to be sure, but it is not even in the same ballpark as getting an education in gospel principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t neglect your education in the things of the Spirit. Don&rsquo;t you dare settle for a kindergarten or a fifth grade education in the doctrines and principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. You will be wise to devote a significant portion of time, energy and effort to a serious study of the doctrine and principles of the gospel so you can apply them with skill every day of your life. Some of you are strong in subjects like philosophy or mathematics but weak in subjects like faith and the Atonement. Watch your balance!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make life&rsquo;s most important and defining decisions based on what you learned studying biology or Shakespeare, and don&rsquo;t make them based on a shaky fifth grade foundation of spiritual knowledge. Here is an interesting perspective from President Spencer W. Kimball. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[The apostles] Peter and John had little secular learning&hellip;but they knew the vital things of life&hellip; They knew the path to eternal life. This they learned in a few decades of their mortal life. Their righteous lives opened the door to&hellip;creation of worlds with eternal increase. For this they would probably need, eventually, a total knowledge of the sciences. But whereas Peter and John had only decades to learn and do the spiritual, they have already had nineteen centuries in which to learn&hellip;the [sciences].&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Not only in matters of intelligence but also in matters of character, spiritual understanding dwarfs academic knowledge in value. The most enlightened and beneficial character traits you will develop will be based on your spiritual understanding&mdash;not on your academic learning. So, during these vital years when your character is forged, don&rsquo;t muddle through with a fifth grade education in the principles of integrity, virtue, charity, self control, and kindness, to name a few. So, again I ask the question: are you smarter than a fifth grader? Spiritually?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a mission president&rsquo;s seminar with our mission presidents in the southeast United States, one of our mission presidents, who was a distinguished professor at BYU in Provo before his call, wrote the following: &ldquo;I would rather have attended this seminar than participated in every academic conference, symposium, and BYU religious education in-service training that I had participated in for the last decade!&rdquo;<sup>3</sup> Remarkable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We value all truth. Truth is truth. But some truth is more important than other truth. Understanding principles of chemistry and sociology is less important than understanding principles of honesty and repentance. Furthermore, the principles taught in the science of chemistry might change with new discoveries over time. The principles of repentance will not change. If you understand the science of medicine so well that you become one of the world&rsquo;s greatest physicians but do not understand the principles of honesty and charity, you will not be happy. If you understand and live the principles of honesty and charity, even if you were a run-of-the-mill doctor or teacher, you have a good chance to be supremely happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how are you doing with your spiritual education? What is your grade level? Are you smarter than a fifth grader? Have you learned how to study the scriptures? Have you learned how to pray? Have you learned how to receive revelation? Do you recognize the promptings of the spirit? Do you understand the covenants you have made? You can&rsquo;t get these things by simply going to church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about a few of the most important and fundamental elements of your spiritual education. First, reading the scriptures. Some time ago I learned that I needed to read the scriptures more slowly. I learn much more and benefit much more if I read somewhat deliberately and not for mileage. Slow down! Elder Holland gave this counsel:&nbsp; &ldquo;Read more slowly and more carefully and with more questions in mind. Ponder&hellip;examine every word, every scriptural gem. &hellip;Hold it up to the light and turn it, look and see what&rsquo;s reflected there.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is great counsel. Don&rsquo;t be a swimmer, paddling along on the surface. Be a diver&ndash;&ndash;go deep! That&rsquo;s where the treasure is. And spend more time listening when you read. Listening you say?&nbsp; How do you listen when you read? Here is how. In Doctrine and Covenants 18:34-36, the Lord taught: &ldquo;These words are not of men nor of man but of me: wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of man; for it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; &hellip;Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice and know my words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spend more time knocking and more time asking when you read. Remember: &ldquo;Ask and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>5</sup> This certainly applies to the scriptures. And, spend more time listening when you pray, not just when you study the scriptures! If you listen more you will enjoy your prayers more, and they will be better prayers. President Kimball taught this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learning the language of prayer is a joyous lifetime experience. Sometimes ideas flood our mind as we listen after our prayers. Sometimes feelings press upon us. A spirit of calmness assures us that all will be well. But always, if we have been honest and earnest, we will experience a good feeling&ndash;&ndash;a feeling of warmth for our Father in Heaven and a sense of His love for us. It has sorrowed me that some of us have not learned the meaning of that calm, spiritual warmth, for it is a witness to us that our prayers have been heard.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>I also love President Gordon B. Hinckley&rsquo;s comment about prayer: &ldquo;Pray to the Lord with the expectation of answers. &hellip;The trouble with most of our prayers is that we give them as if we were picking up the telephone and ordering groceries. We place our order and hang up. We need to meditate, contemplate, think of what we are praying about and for.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do your prayers sometimes resemble a spiritual grocery list? Part of what President Hinckley is talking about is taking time to ponder. Do you understand what ponder means? Have you learned how to do it? It simply means to stop and think about the depth of an idea and mull it over in your mind and think about the significance of it and how it applies to you, right now. This is difficult in reading the scriptures and in praying because pondering slows us down. We have places to go and things to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 3 Nephi 17:2-3, the Savior directed the people to ponder on His words and pray for understanding: &ldquo;I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words which I am commanded of the Father to speak unto you at this time. Therefore, go ye unto your homes and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name that ye may understand&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pondering opens the door to understanding and to revelation. Look at the powerful examples of pure revelation in the scriptures that came from pondering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 Nephi 11:1: &ldquo;For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat <strong>pondering</strong> in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants 138: 1, 2, 11: &ldquo;On the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in my room <strong>pondering</strong> over the scriptures, And <strong>reflecting</strong> upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son of God, for the redemption of the world; &hellip;.As I <strong>pondered</strong> over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a perfect description of the process of receiving revelation. I promise you that you will learn more in the five minutes you spend thinking and pondering after you have read the scriptures than you would learn from five more minutes of reading. So I repeat: slow down! Think! Ponder! These are wonderful keys to revelation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was having lunch with two members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles a few months ago. We were talking about school. All three of us had had exactly the same dream. You may have had it also. You get your schedule for final exams and you realize you signed up for a class that you have not attended. You have never been to class and have no clue about the material. You are in for some long nights of cramming. This is a very bad dream.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have you learned to do your spiritual homework including prayer and scripture study on a regular basis and not cram? Regular prayer, scripture study, and regular contact with heaven are more important than occasional spectacular spiritual experiences, not only for your spiritual growth and understanding, but because this is one of the most important ways that the Lord will protect you day to day from evil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you learned that answers to prayer usually come a piece at a time, line upon line, rather than all at once? Have you learned this so you do not get discouraged when you pray earnestly and the answers don&rsquo;t seem to come? Have you learned that the Lord has His own timetable for answering? God&rsquo;s clock and ours are rarely synchronized. The Lord says over and over in the scriptures that He will do things in his own due time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is another suggestion for your prayers and scripture study. A few years ago, I had an assignment to accompany President Boyd K. Packer to a stake conference in Arizona. He invited me to his hotel room early Sunday morning and asked if I had any questions I would like to ask him. What an opportunity! I said, &ldquo;President, how can I put myself in a position to receive more revelation?&rdquo; The first thing he said was to &ldquo;get up early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early morning is a quiet, peaceful time when our minds are clear and we can dive into the scriptures and have our private, meaningful prayer all alone. It is a perfect environment for hearing the voice of the Lord and feeling what He wants us to do. Have you learned to get up early? I promise you it will help you receive more revelation. Maybe the best advice I could give you in this entire talk is to start every day with some quiet time where you are alone and on your knees with personal prayer, some thoughtful, slow scripture study, and a few moments of serious pondering. If you will do that, we will not worry about you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now another important question regarding your spiritual education: are you listening to your professors? Your spiritual professors? I refer to the 15 men we sustain as prophets, seers and revelators. You have some wonderful teachers in these 15 men. They are spiritually brilliant. They love you. They want the best for you. Collectively they know you well, and they pray for you to succeed. What a perfect resume for a professor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you listening? I am trying to listen. I have learned life-changing truths from every one of them. This afternoon I thought I would share just a few of the things I have learned from a few of them that have made a great difference in my life and spiritual education. These might be of some benefit to you, but more importantly, I hope you are assembling your own set of files on what you are learning from the Brethren. If I were you, I would start that now if you have not already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson: My wife and I were with him at a regional conference in Las Vegas. After a long Saturday of meetings that concluded about 9:00 p.m., my wife and I decided to go see some famous impressionist paintings that were being exhibited in one of the hotels before retiring. We were tired and could not imagine how tired President Monson must be after speaking and presiding in all those meetings. The next morning I sat by President Monson in the Sunday meeting. He handed me a thank you note he had just received. This was a note from a sister thanking him for visiting her aging mother in a nursing home the previous evening after 9:00 p.m. We went to entertain ourselves, and he went to a nursing home. That was a lesson in charity I will never forget. Has your charity progressed beyond a fifth grade level? I hope so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Henry B. Eyring:&nbsp; At a meeting in Houston with 40 to 50 stake, mission, and temple presidents eagerly awaiting instruction from President Eyring, serving as one of the Twelve at the time, he stood and said something like this: &ldquo;You have some significant challenges. Now what are some of the most important challenges you are facing and what is the Lord telling you at this moment about how to resolve them?&rdquo; He reminded them that they were receiving revelation all of the time. They were waiting to be fed by his revelation; he tapped theirs. The discussion went forward and was very enlightening. You too are receiving revelation continually. Turn off the music and the TV some of the time and listen!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On another occasion, I was at a meeting in the temple. President Eyring was bearing his testimony. Right at that moment my cell phone went off in my pocket. Thankfully, it was on vibrate, but just for an instant I was tempted to look at the phone and see who was calling. What a tragedy that would have been to miss even one word of a testimony from a special witness of the Lord to see if my golf time was set for the next day, or something as equally unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Are you missing out on some promptings from the still, small voice that you are entitled to because you are spending too much time preoccupied with your cell phone, iPod, TV, or some other electronic device?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf: I was assigned to accompany then-Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf to reorganize a stake and select a new stake president in Texas. After our interviews, we both had good feelings about a certain man. He asked me if I felt this was the right man. I answered that I thought he was the right man, but that I did not feel that I had received a firm spiritual confirmation. We continued to discuss and pray and still I did not feel that I had the solid confirmation I wanted, so he simply asked me, &ldquo;Well, do you have a better idea?&rdquo; It was time to make the decision. We went ahead and called the man and as we went forward, it became clear that he was certainly the Lord&rsquo;s choice. Brigham Young said it this way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do not know the will of my Father, and what he requires of me in a certain transaction, if I ask Him to give me wisdom concerning any requirement in life, or in regard to my own course, ...or those I preside over, and get no answer from Him, and then do the very best that judgment will teach me, He is bound to&hellip;honor that transaction, and He will do so to all intents and purposes.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do your homework, study it out, and earnestly plead with the Lord for an answer and do not feel you have received it&ndash;&ndash;go ahead with your best judgment and the Lord will either back up your decision or He will soon warn you that you are going down the wrong path.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer: President Packer teaches that keeping the Sabbath day holy allows you to get off the busy highway of life with its hectic pace and quietly and calmly check the map&ndash;&ndash;the spiritual map that keeps us on track with the things of eternity. Don&rsquo;t miss the Sabbath as a golden time to check your spiritual compass. What a sad thing it would be to miss life-altering lessons on repentance or building faith taught by the spirit in order to study for an American History exam. Doesn&rsquo;t this journey through eternity deserve at least one day a week to devote to some long-range planning? I repeat, get off the freeway on Sunday and spend your time with the maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales: Don&rsquo;t judge others. If behavior you observe is suboptimal, go to the rescue; don&rsquo;t rush to judgment. Ask yourself, &ldquo;How could I help this person,&rdquo; not &ldquo;Would you look at that? How bad is that?&rdquo; I was playing golf with Elder Hales and a young couple in front of us was very slow and it looked like they were not playing serious golf. I was getting frustrated with the delay and was upset with them. Finally they walked off to the side of the fairway and invited us to play through. I said to myself, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I was surprised when Elder Hales politely asked the couple if they would like to finish the last few holes with us. They gladly agreed. After the round, the young man approached me and wanted to talk. He was a less-active returned missionary who had recognized Elder Hales when they joined us. Because he was listening to the Spirit, Elder Hales&rsquo; invitation for them to play with us resulted later in a meeting in Elder Hales&rsquo; office and a priesthood blessing for the young man by an apostle. I was thinking about finishing a round of golf. Elder Hales was listening to the Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson:&nbsp; I learned from Elder Christofferson that a witness of the Spirit is more sure and more valuable than even a visit from an angel. He shared the following quote with me: &ldquo;So vastly important is the gift of the Holy Ghost in the salvation of men that nothing can supply its place. There is nothing that a man can see with his eyes or hear with his ears or handle with his hands which can supply the place of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;<sup>9</sup> Have you learned that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate this principle further, Alma the Younger saw an angel. The angel talked to him face to face and the experience caused the ground to shake and left him unable to speak and move for three days.<sup>10</sup> What an experience. Yet in the fifth chapter of Alma when he was bearing his testimony with the words &ldquo;And how do you suppose I know of these things for sure?&rdquo;<sup>11</sup> he didn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;I saw an angel face to face.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;&hellip;they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit...&rdquo;<sup>12</sup> It is important that you learn to recognize the voice of the Spirit and listen to it. It is a sure witness. Don&rsquo;t stand around waiting for an angel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I ask again. Are you listening to your professors&ndash;&ndash;these wonderful magnificent teachers in the subjects of life and salvation? In conclusion, perhaps the most valuable way to learn spiritual doctrine is outlined in the book of John: &ldquo;If any man will <strong>do</strong> his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.&rdquo;<sup>13</sup> Living the commandments will teach you more about truth and how to be happy and successful in eternity than any gospel doctrine class or manual. So in that context, I have some final questions for you to consider. What are you not doing that you need to start doing? What are you doing that you need to stop doing? And, what are you doing half-heartedly that you need to be doing with full energy of heart?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are certainly a choice group. Our Heavenly Father, our God, lives and presides in the universe. Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful to know we have a father who is in charge of everything? He knows you and cares about you. You have some of His spiritual divinity within you as his spiritual sons and daughters, and we have very high expectations for you. Jesus Christ is His only Begotten Son. I know that. He is who He said He is&mdash;our Redeemer. &ldquo;And this is life eternal that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&rdquo;<sup>14</sup> Do you know your Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ? How are you coming along with your spiritual education? Are you smarter than a fifth grader? I trust you are! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p></p>
<p>A number of years ago one of our grandsons entered mortality. His tiny tabernacle had not been perfectly formed and his body was not adequate to sustain life. This precious little gift from God lived but an hour. The sorrow of the moment has now been softened by many hours of deep and reverent reflection.<br /><br />Although the privilege of sweet association with the child has been deferred, there were also reasons for quiet rejoicing. The child was born in the covenant. His father gave him a name and a blessing during the child's brief moments of life. And the lad received a body. That body, which he undoubtedly had been promised in the premortal estate, was gladly received and that child now has claim upon that body in perfected form as long as time shall last.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Dear students, my purpose today is to heighten your appreciation for something you may sometimes take for granted--your precious bodies, a gift far, far exceeding your present power to comprehend, indeed a gift for which you may have prayed a thousand times ten thousand times before you entered mortality.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you could momentarily remember your earlier life by peeking behind the veil, you would once again shout for joy because you have a body. You lived for a very long time without one, undoubtedly admiring the bodies of your heavenly parents. Your spirit has now become happily bonded to your own body and the service and joy it provides. You will not willingly be separated from it, and when that day of separation comes you will be very eager for its return.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the profound truths of the plan of salvation is represented by this bold declaration from the Doctrine and Covenants: "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also" (Doctrine and Covenants 130:22). These exalted beings possess such bodies because they are necessary and desirable for them, just as they are for you and for our grandson, more so than any of us can presently understand. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There are some things that cannot be enjoyed without a body. Elder Melvin J. Ballard, grandfather of our current apostle M. Russell Ballard and also a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, reinforces this grand truth with this example:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The soul of the musician may be on fire with divine harmonies, but he can never make others feel what he feels unless he is given the human voice, the organ, the violin, some instrument of expression; only then can he make others feel what he feels. So the spirit of man may have thrilled with desires and hopes and ambitions that never could have been experienced without a physical body. The joys of fatherhood would never have been ours without mortality; the joys that come in that dear companionship as husband and wife, and a thousand other joys of earth, never would have been ours without this mortal tabernacle" (<em>Melvin J. Ballard--Crusader for</em>&nbsp;<em>Righteousness,&nbsp;</em>Bookcraft, 1966, 155).</p>
<p>How grateful we are for the knowledge that the union of spirit and body constitutes a living soul, and only in that union is there fulness of joy (see Doctrine and Covenants 88:15-16; 93:33; 2 Nephi 9:13).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When we observe brothers or sisters temporarily deprived of any member or function of the body, even in the smallest degree, our hearts are extended to them. Their spirits are not impaired, but the absence of some faculty of the body brings a temporary deprivation of the full enjoyment and service it was intended to provide. In a different but very real way, we shall also experience deprivation when not part but rather the entirety of our physical bodies is separated from us through death (Moses 4:25; Genesis 3:19). We will then understand, as the scriptures testify, that separation is bondage (Doctrine and Covenants 138:50). We will anxiously look forward for the day of the resurrection, as did those viewed by President Joseph F. Smith in his great vision of the redemption of the dead (Doctrine and Covenants 138:14-17).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />On one occasion while serving in the temple I observed a 12-year-old boy, dressed in white, who had come to perform proxy baptisms and confirmations. He was in a wheelchair, for he had been born without arms or legs. His spirit was whole and his small body was only temporarily deprived. He had come to the temple intending only to do confirmations, which at first appearance seemed quite convenient as he remained in his wheelchair. But, with encouragement from ordinance workers, he was taken into the font and there immersed as proxy for others who, if permitted to witness, must have wept at the honor of having such a special son of God baptized for them.&nbsp;<br /><br />I imagined that this young man, in far greater proportion than myself and others, understood the great miracle of a body, complete and whole. He did not feel sorry for himself. His spirit soared and he bore a fervent testimony. He had learned to swim like a dolphin. He could write with a pencil in his mouth. He could attend to many of his own needs. He undoubtedly was also grateful for the heavenly assurance that someday his tabernacle would be added upon and perfected, in the image of his God. The boy's name is Gabriel. For a brief moment we were blessed by the presence of our own angel Gabriel in the Bountiful Temple. He came without wings, or even arms or legs.&nbsp;<br /><br />A few months ago I had the privilege of sealing another angel--a beautiful daughter of God--to her eternal companion. The girl had been born deaf. Except by the spiritual ear she had never heard Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony"<em>&nbsp;</em>or Handel's "Hallelujah Chorus."<em>&nbsp;</em>When children come into their family, she will never hear her baby's cry, or its first spoken word, or its first talk in Primary. She is not handicapped, as she marvelously compensates in other ways. She is differentially blessed. Her children will be born in the covenant, she has an eternal companion, and she has a body with heaven's promise of its someday perfection. We find comfort in these words from one of our fine Church leaders:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I am convinced that no soul has ever been whipped into this mortal existence; that each one of us came willingly, cheerfully, and gladly; even though we might have known that we were to inherit a body that was crippled, maimed, and deformed, still we were glad to come. ... We came gladly and willingly, for our eyes were not so much centered upon the sorrows and troubles of life as upon the grandness of that which lies beyond" (<em>Melvin J. Ballard</em>--<em>Crusader for Righteousness</em>, Bookcraft, 1966, 154-55).</p>
<p>Every time you look in the mirror you can witness the miracle of your mortal body, for you can see, hear, smell, taste, feel, and create. If you appreciated your tabernacle, you might often remain riveted at the mirror moving fingers, raising eyebrows, mouthing words, and generally rejoicing that this marvelous body so obediently responds to your will. The miracle would not be viewed less because it may be observed so often.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In the days of your more mature spiritual reflection you would also pause to glory in the power of creating bodies for others. This power of creation has been entrusted to you during mortality for a limited time, for with the passage of years it will be taken from you. The creative power is also entrusted to you for the limited purpose of creating physical bodies. But if you keep your covenants, God will someday grant you unlimited power to create both spirits and bodies. You will thereby become fathers and mothers of nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I believe that this present creative power is given in greater proportion to you sisters. One day heaven will come down and touch the earth when you feel life for the first time and become a co-creator with God. You will not sculpt or mold the intended tabernacle with earthly hands. You will not chisel it to its marvelous completion. You will not consciously choose the color of its hair or eyes, or its dimensions. But that little body will not only be created with you, it will be created within you. Then God will place a spirit in its little tabernacle, and the child, like you, will become a living soul. To create a Rembrandt painting or a Mozart symphony would be a marvelous thing, but such creative acts are not on speaking terms with the miracle of creating a physical body.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dear young people, the most Godlike thing you will ever do is to use your bodies to create bodies for others. But this you could never do if you did not already possess a Godlike body of your own. Those who do not have the opportunity to exercise the creative power on this earth will be rewarded for their patience and faith through its expression in the life to come, and to their complete satisfaction.&nbsp;<br /><br />Because the creative power is so sacred, you must carefully protect it. There is a great message in Sir Walter Scott's&nbsp;<em>Ivanhoe</em>. The lovely Rebecca, a virtuous Jewish maiden, had been singled out by the outlaw Brian de Bois-Guilbert for base reasons. She offered him her costly bracelets and collar as a ransom, but it was her virtue he intended to take.&nbsp;<br /><br />When Rebecca perceived his immoral purpose she threw open the latticed window of her prison room and stood upon the parapet, with no barrier between her and the great distance below. "Remain where thou art, proud Templar, or at thy choice advance! -- one foot nearer, and I plunge myself from the precipice; my body shall be bruised out of the very form of humanity upon the stones of that courtyard, 'ere it become the victim of thy brutality!"&nbsp;<br /><br />The proud Templar had been disgraced. He replied: "Come down, rash girl! - I swear to earth, and sea, and sky, I will offer thee no offense." Rebecca was exemplary in her desire to resist the forcible brutality of an unrighteous man.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of the great battles of the last days arise from Satan's deprivations, and one of these is not having a body (<em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,&nbsp;</em>181; 297). Our temporary sorrow at the time of separation of spirit and body is greatly exceeded by Lucifer's anguish at the permanent loss. Because the adversary cannot have a body, it is loathsome to him that any of his spirit siblings could ever have a fulness of joy by possessing a physical tabernacle. He knows that it is a great possession, giving us power over him. The Prophet Joseph Smith said, "All beings who have bodies have power over those who have not" (<em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</em>&nbsp;181). Elder James E. Talmage of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles eloquently wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As an act of diabolic reprisal following [Lucifer's] rejection in the council, his defeat by Michael and the heavenly hosts, and his ignominious expulsion from heaven [Rev 12:7-9], Satan planned to destroy the bodies in which the faithful spirits &acirc;"&euro; those who had kept their first estate [Abr. 3:26] &acirc;"&euro; would be born" (<em>Jesus the Christ,&nbsp;</em>20).</p>
<p>Many elective abortions, causing the destruction of bodies prepared for righteous spirits, are part of Satan's destructive plan. If Lucifer cannot destroy your body before birth, he induces you to thereafter defile or neglect it, through alcohol, drugs, inattention, or abuse, so that your enjoyment may be curtailed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There are no bounds to Lucifer's creativity in enticing you to neglect or misuse your body. This is not a casual matter to him. He is preoccupied with it. The adversary is especially jealous of your power to procreate. He uses all forms of modern media to strip the body of its spiritual beauty. He whispers to you to only measure your body's worth by its worldly attractiveness. His pressure is unremitting for you to observe pornography, immodestly flaunt your body, and become obsessed with physical appearance. His laughter at your foolishness when you yield to his persuasions would make you shudder.&nbsp;<br /><br />Satan intends to destroy your spirit through your body. He makes worldly enticements all look so attractive. Nevertheless, you may be certain who is the author of inducements to look at pornography, live immorally, experiment with improper substances, and violate, mark, expose, defile, or neglect your body. And that author is not your friend. As stated by President Boyd K. Packer:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Our physical body is the instrument of our spirit. In that marvelous revelation, the Word of Wisdom, we are told how to keep our bodies free from impurities which might dull, even destroy, those delicate physical senses which have to do with spiritual communication" ("Revelation in a Changing World,"&nbsp;<em>Ensign,</em>&nbsp;Nov. 1989, 14).</p>
<p>Young people, you came to this earth not only to receive bodies but also to learn to master them, which experience you never had until mortality. That, in part, is why mastery of the body is so hard. A newborn baby must learn the physical processes of focusing its eyes, sucking, coordinating hand movements, turning over, crawling, standing, and running. No one has to tell the child to do these things, for the instinct is heaven-instilled. There will be bruised knees along the way, but they will heal. These steps, however, are not the end of learning self-discipline over the tabernacle. The child must also learn to control and channel urges, avoiding eating the wrong types of food (or too much!), misusing the creative power, and unwisely marking or puncturing the body to keep pace with a modern fad. It is an unending battle to see whether the body conquers the spirit or the spirit conquers the body. Elder Ballard added these beautiful words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I have gained strength to say to the house I live in: 'You cannot defile this tabernacle; I will have it clean; I will not have the windows darkened. I will not have this body defiled; it is my servant and it must be kept clean'" (<em>Melvin J. Ballard--Crusader for Righteousness,</em>&nbsp;180).</p>
<p>Just as the evil spirits, cast out by the Master from borrowed homes, "begged a body," even so you, in the premortal estate, viewing Father's perfected tabernacle, may have earnestly coveted one. It was unthinkable to your innocent minds that such a treasure, if ever received, would be neglected or defiled or permitted through disrespect to prematurely age, become unclean, or decay. But some of you have already forgotten, and what a forgetfulness that is! Before you were born you may have observed that Father took care of His body and treated it with dignity and respect. Your resolve was to do the same. There was nothing casual about your premortal desire for a body, and there must be nothing casual about your present-day care of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The clay of your life is still warm, and habits that will govern the rest of your years are now forming. If you eat poorly, favor fast foods, rest inadequately, experiment with stimulating substances, and become casual in your appearance, then you will someday say with King Saul of Old Testament times: "I have played the fool, and erred exceedingly" (1 Samuel 26:21).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Young people, you are the master here. You have the strength to say to the house you live in, "I will have you clean." This includes both moral and physical cleanliness. You are a son or daughter of God, and cleanliness is interwoven into everything you are and do and must become. Elder Talmage gave us this insightful caution:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We should look upon this body as something that shall endure in the resurrected state, beyond the grave, something to be kept pure and holy. Be not afraid of soiling its hands; be not afraid of scars that may come to it if won in earnest effort, or in honest fight, but beware of scars that disfigure, that have come to you in places where you ought not have gone, that have befallen you in unworthy undertakings; beware of the wounds in battles in which you have been fighting on the wrong side" (Conference Report, October 1913, 117).</p>
<p>These disfiguring scars and wounds often come through neglect of the body, or the irreverent marking, use, and immodest dressing of our sacred tabernacles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />To the exquisite sorrow of their parents, many infants, like our grandson, have passed away shortly following mortal birth. Their lives were not wasted, nor were the efforts of their mothers in bearing them. Although these children, in preparation for exalted living, will eventually require the tutelage and experience required for all of us, they returned home to the Father of their spirits, rejoicing that a primary purpose of coming to earth had been completely fulfilled. They now had claim on something absolutely necessary for their eternal happiness--a priceless body.&nbsp;<br /><br />Righteous parents will never forget the child, and they will also never forget the sublime experience of begetting it. These God-given feelings will be renewed and enlarged in the next life when the parents embrace and nourish their child again as permitted by Father's perfect plan. Elder Matthew Cowley of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, speaking at the passing of an infant, exclaimed:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wish I had a dozen children just like this one.... I wish I had a dozen that had lived only for a minute because I am so convinced of the eternity of things that life is going to be the eternal integrity of the family.... The child belongs to the parents to whom it was given" (<em>Matthew Cowley--Man of Faith,</em>&nbsp;Bookcraft, 1954, 268).</p>
<p>These are the proper and comforting sentiments of every parent pained by the seemingly premature loss of a child. In God's great plan for our happiness nothing has ultimately been lost. Parents may rejoice that their sorrow is only temporary, for their ties to their child are eternal.&nbsp;<br /><br />Those who have passed into the next life have undoubtedly renewed their intense desire for a body, but now more fervently for they have already had the mortal taste of its possession. They know that the spirit is most comfortable, even at home, when housed in a body. Then it is complete. They will be anxious to come forth in the morning of the first resurrection, not only because the timing of the resurrection dictates the type of body they receive but also because they will be impatient in waiting (Doctrine and Covenants 138:50).</p>
<p>Perhaps we desired bodies in the premortal estate, coveting not only their functional usefulness, but also their beauty. It is not important at this stage of our mortal journey that bodies be perfect, as even imperfect bodies are miracles. It is also of little eternal significance if at the present moment our bodies are not of the dimension and appearance we most desire.&nbsp;<br /><br />These concerns may be deferred, for they shall happily be attended to by the One who gave us the tabernacle, in His time and to our complete satisfaction. The restorative and beautification miracle of the resurrection will refine every aspect of the physical tabernacle. We have claim to ultimate perfection, but for the present it quite suffices to have an imperfect body, coupled with the promise of its destiny (Doctrine and Covenants 138:17<em>).&nbsp;</em>Amulek promised, "The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfected form" (Alma 11:43). Brigham Young taught:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Those who attain to the blessing of the first or celestial resurrection will be pure and holy, and perfect in body. Every man or woman that reaches to this unspeakable attainment will be as beautiful as the angels that surround the throne of God" (<em>Journal of Discourses</em>&nbsp;10:24).</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith saw the resurrected Adam and Eve. They were described as "the two most beautiful and perfect specimens of mankind [I have] ever seen." "Their heads were white as snow, and their faces shone with youth" (<em>Words of Joseph Smith,</em>&nbsp;404, n42). You will be beautiful, too. The latter-day revelation that God has a body of flesh and bones speaks volumes to us (Doctrine and Covenants 130:22). We must not be misled by the simplicity of the declaration. It proclaims one of the most profound truths of the gospel plan.&nbsp;<br /><br />Joseph Smith testified, "There is no other God in heaven but that God who has flesh and bones....We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it before God in the celestial kingdom" (<em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</em>&nbsp;181). You have received your marvelous body as a gift from God. This is a gift you very much desired. Now you must decide what you will do with this magnificent house you live in. If you can become its master, your potential to become like God is limitless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I testify that these things are true and part of God's great plan of happiness for His children. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I am grateful for the opportunity to be with you today. Sister Child and I always love coming to BYU-Idaho. It was such a beautiful drive up and it is such a fine university. I am grateful for President Clark and the faculty for the high standard of excellence that exists here. I have a soft spot in my heart for this university. Two of our children attended here when it was Ricks College. It was here they established a foundation for learning that has proven so valuable to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have a soft spot in my heart for temples. It was a thrill to drive into this valley and see a shining house of the Lord standing as a beacon, inviting all to enter into its hallowed walls. I love the temple. What a blessing it was for Sister Child and for me to serve in the Salt Lake Temple; to participate in the great work that takes place in God&rsquo;s holy house. It is the work of salvation for all of God&rsquo;s children. It is God&rsquo;s work; therefore, it should be our work. The perception in the past was that temple work was something we did when we got older. Many years ago Elder John A. Widtsoe made this statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need more converts to temple work, drawn from all ages, from the young, from the middle-aged, and from the rich and poor, from among the busy and those of leisure&hellip; Temple work is quite as much benefit to the young and the active as to the aged&hellip; The young man needs his place in the temple even more than his father and his grandfather&hellip; The young girl just entering life needs the spirit, influence and direction that come from participation in the temple ordinances. If I say nothing else tonight that will linger, I hope you will remember that temple work is for the young and the middle aged and for the aged. Temple work is for all."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Elder Widtsoe would be happy to know how much the youth of the Church love the temple. The baptistery in the Salt Lake Temple opens every morning at 5:00 a.m. where young people flock to do this sacred work. It thrills us to see faithful young adults come to do endowment sessions and young married couples coming to the temple for their &ldquo;date nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several years ago Sister Child and I were invited to speak at a BYU stake young adult fireside in Provo. We were asked to speak about the temple. A few weeks before the fireside we realized that it was scheduled on Super Bowl Sunday. We assumed that there would be very few in attendance. As we drove on to the campus there wasn&rsquo;t a car on the road, not a person on the street. The campus looked totally deserted. We were greeted by the stake president and taken into a large hall that to our surprise was filled to capacity with faithful young people. Our hearts were touched because of their stalwartness. Sister Child in her remarks expressed gratitude for their attendance when they could be home watching the Super Bowl. Afterwards many of them expressed to us that they loved the temple much more than they loved football. We are grateful for your faithfulness and love of the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A temple is literally a house of the Lord, a holy sanctuary in which sacred ceremonies and ordinances of the gospel are performed&ndash;&ndash;a place where the Lord may come; it is the most holy of any place of worship on the earth.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Temple work has always been part of our Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan. In the Bible we read that when Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt, he was commanded to build a sanctuary &ldquo;that I might dwell among them.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup> It was their temple in the wilderness. We read of the splendor and beauty of Solomon&rsquo;s Temple, the rebuilding of the Temple of Zerubbabel, and, of course, Herod&rsquo;s magnificent temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon we read of many temples on this continent. We read of Nephi building a temple patterned after Solomon&rsquo;s temple. We know King Benjamin gathered his people to the temple in Zarahemla to hear his last great sermon and that after Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion He appeared to the faithful Saints at the temple in Bountiful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our day the significance of temples has been taught right from the beginning of the restoration. We know from modern scripture that on the night of September 21, 1823, Moroni visited Joseph three times. Among other things, Moroni quoted prophecies from the Old Testament concerning the last days. He quoted the third chapter of Malachi a little differently than is recorded in the King James Bible. It is recorded in the 2<sup>nd</sup> section of the Doctrine and Covenants as Moroni gave it to Joseph. It states:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, I will reveal unto you the priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>What are the promises that were made to the fathers? The promises of salvation, the promises of exaltation, the promises that come to us as we partake of sacred ordinances that are performed only in the house of the Lord. The hearts of the children are turning to their fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December 1832, less than two years after the Church had been organized, the Saints were gathering in Kirtland, Ohio. They were relatively few in number and most living in poverty. It was under these difficult circumstances that the Lord commanded them to build a temple. He said: &ldquo;Organize yourselves; prepared every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the difficult conditions in which they were living, they didn&rsquo;t immediately act upon that commandment. Five months later, in June 1833, the Saints were chastened by the Lord for their failure to build a temple. He said: &ldquo;Wherefore, ye must needs be chastened and stand rebuked before my face: For ye have sinned against me a very grievous sin, in that ye have not considered the great commandment in all things that I have given unto you concerning the building of mine house.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can imagine how it would feel to be chastened by the Lord. Within a few days preparations were made and the construction of the temple began. It was built at a great sacrifice; but as we know, &ldquo;Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of Heaven.&rdquo; On April 3, 1836, one week after the temple had been dedicated, Elijah the prophet, along with others holding priesthood keys appeared to Joseph and Oliver. Elijah committed into their hands the sealing power wherein individuals and families can receive the blessings of salvation. What a glorious event&ndash;&ndash;the sealing power was once again upon the earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The temple continued to be the focus of the Prophet Joseph throughout his life. As the Saints were driven from place to place, temple sites were selected: first in Jackson County, then in Far West, and finally in Nauvoo where a beautiful temple stands today as a tribute to their faithfulness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even after his death, Joseph&rsquo;s legacy continued. Four days after the Saints arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, Brigham Young selected the site for the Salt Lake Temple. Three other temples were built before the Salt Lake Temple was completed: St. George, Logan, and Manti. That legacy continues today with 136 temples scattered around the world, with 30 more announced or under construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s people have always been a temple building, temple loving, and temple attending people. Why? Why is there such an emphasis on temples and being worthy to enter them? Because temple ordinances are absolutely essential for our exaltation. It is only in the house of the Lord that ordinances are made and covenants entered into that will allow us to live with God and our families forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several years before Sister Child and I began our service at the Salt Lake Temple, we served for four years in West Africa. One of the many highlights of our service there was to be involved in the construction and dedication of two temples in West Africa: one in Accra, Ghana, and one in Aba, Nigeria. We witnessed what a blessing these temples were to the faithful Saints in that part of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Accra Ghana Temple is the most beautiful building in Ghana. We were excited about the open house knowing that many would come. We knew that those who came would be impressed with the beauty of the building and the well-manicured grounds; we prayed they would also feel the spirit of the temple. We invited the president of Ghana, President John Kufor, for a private tour of the temple. He is not a member of our faith, but had good feelings toward the Church. He wanted to keep his visit as low-key as possible and indicated that he could spend 15 minutes in the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we escorted him through the various rooms we knew our prayers had been answered. He was not only impressed with the beauty of the temple, but he also felt the Spirit. He remained asking questions and making comments for nearly an hour. As we walked out of the temple we realized that his visit had not been kept a secret. The temple steps were filled with the media with their cameras and microphones, all wanting to get the president&rsquo;s impression of the building. One of the reporters asked President Kufor what he thought of the Mormon temple. President Kufor commented on its beauty and then stated, &ldquo;This temple will raise the spiritual level of our entire nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks later President Hinckley came for the dedication. A press conference was arranged for the prophet to meet with the press. He stated nearly the same words of President Kufor. He said, &ldquo;This temple will not only bless the lives of the members of the Church; it will bless the entire nation of Ghana and all of West Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The day before the dedication the prophet held a fireside for members of the Church. They came, some traveling for days, to see and hear a prophet of God. As he stood to address them, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting old, you probably won&rsquo;t see me again and I won&rsquo;t see you again in this life, so listen very carefully; what I have to say is very important.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;I am going to tell you four things that you need to do to be acceptable to the Lord, to retain your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and to be worthy to enter this beautiful house of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You must pray daily.&rdquo; As he talked to them about prayer, it was as if he were a loving grandfather speaking to his grandchildren. He said, &ldquo;Think of the miracle of prayer! Imagine&ndash;&ndash;here we are&ndash;&ndash;just mortal people and we can kneel and pray to our Heavenly Father and He hears us! Now, all of our prayers might not be answered as soon as we would like, or the way we would like, but He hears them. It&rsquo;s a miracle.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through all ages of time, the commandment has been, &ldquo;Ask of God; ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find, knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup> Our Heavenly Father loves you; you are His children. He is always there for you if only you will ask in humble daily prayer. President Hinckley ended by saying again, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a miracle that we can pray to our Heavenly Father and know that He answers our prayers? Well, it&rsquo;s marvelous!&rdquo; Can&rsquo;t you just hear President Hinckley saying that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next he counseled them to have daily scripture study. He admonished them to &ldquo;Search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of me.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup> The scriptures point us to our Savior; they keep us on the road that will lead back to Him. You will remember when the Lord commanded Lehi to send his sons back to Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass from Laban. It was not an easy journey, nor was it an easy task to convince Laban to give them the plates, which contained their genealogy as well as sacred holy writ. Their lives were threatened, their gold and silver were stolen, Laman and Lemuel murmured and wanted to give up and return to their father in the wilderness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Nephi refused to leave until they had obtained the plates. In his final attempt, he was led by the Spirit to Laban&rsquo;s home. There in the street he found a man drunken with wine. It was Laban. The Spirit constrained Nephi to kill Laban, telling him: &ldquo;it is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.&rdquo;<sup>9</sup> Without the scriptures, not only nations, but individuals, families, and peoples dwindle in unbelief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, President Hinckley counseled the Ghanaian Saints to attend their meetings. He went on to say, &ldquo;We need to attend our meetings. It is in our meetings that we gain strength from one another. We are edified and taught the doctrine. The Spirit of the Lord is there. The Lord tells us that where two or more are gathered in His name, He will be in the midst of them.&rdquo; I remember as a young Scout learning a valuable lesson that has stayed with me all these years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were sitting around a campfire; the coals were red with fire, hot and glowing. Our scoutmaster flipped one of the coals from the fire onto the ground and suggested that we watch what happened to the single piece of coal. We watched for a while and noticed that it was losing its glow and its warmth. After watching until the coal was almost black, the wise scoutmaster tossed it back with the other coals into the warmth of the fire. The coal gradually regained its warmth and its luster. He likened it to our Scout troop and how much we need each other. And so it is within the Church. We need to attend our meetings so, as President Hinckley said, we can strengthen and edify one another, and learn the doctrine that will keep us close to the Savior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last thing President Hinckley talked about was tithing. He admonished the Saints to pay their tithes and offerings. This can be a challenge for anyone, giving 10 percent to the Lord. But for the people in Africa, because of their living conditions and their poverty, it is truly a test of faith.&nbsp; President Joseph F. Smith acknowledged that it is a test. He said: &ldquo;The loyalty of the people of this church shall be put to a test by this principle of tithing.&nbsp; It shall be known who is for the kingdom of God and who is against it. It shall be shown whether we be faithful or unfaithful.&rdquo;<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Hinckley reminded the Saints of the significance of tithing. He said, &ldquo;We pay tithing first because it is a commandment of the Lord, and second, because it is a commandment with a promise. The promise is that we will be blessed if we pay our tithing. The windows of heaven will be opened and blessings will be poured out upon us.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a blessing for us to see the faithfulness of the African Saints and the blessings they received as they paid their tithing. Let me tell you about a good friend of ours. Her name is Ester. Her husband died just prior to our arrival in Ghana. She is a young mother trying to raise three small children. She is fortunate in that she has a job, but making ends meet is a challenge, especially when her children&rsquo;s school fees are due. One Saturday night she went home from work with her weekly paycheck. As she looked at it she realized she had enough to pay her rent and the school fees. What was left was exactly what she needed to pay tithing. That left nothing to buy food for the coming week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had a testimony of tithing and believed the Lord would bless her to be able to find food for her family and so she put her tithing into an envelope and gave it to the bishop the next day at church. She and her children walked several miles home from church because there was no money for transportation. She said she prayed all the way home and all afternoon that the children would not be hungry because there was no food for them in their home. They went to bed and awoke in the morning hungry but not complaining; they too had faith that the Lord would provide. The children went to school and Ester went to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As she arrived a man she did not know approached her. He got on his knees and asked her forgiveness. When she told him she had nothing to forgive, he arose and told her this story. Her husband had lent him some money a few weeks before his death and when he heard that he had died he felt he was debt free and did not need to repay the loan. He said, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t given it another thought until yesterday afternoon when I thought of you. I couldn&rsquo;t get you off my mind and I knew I had to repay the money your husband lent to me.&rdquo; He handed her an envelope containing the exact amount of money she had paid for tithing, enough to buy food for her family for the week. What a testimony of tithing! Ester and her children continue to be active members of the Church and enjoy the blessings that come as they faithfully pay their tithing. President Monson said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always be active in the Church. I will give you a formula which will guarantee to a large extent your success in fulfilling that commitment. It is simple; it consists of just three words: pay your tithing. When members of the Church pay tithing, honestly and faithfully, they have very little difficulty keeping the other commandments of God. It is a benchmark commandment.&rdquo;<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a benchmark commandment. The blessing of paying our tithing is a requirement to enter the holy temple where we receive the blessings of eternal life&ndash;&ndash;the blessings of salvation for us and for our families.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Saints in West Africa love the temple; they love their families and sacrifice a great deal to secure the blessings of the temple for themselves and their loved ones. Many of them travel for days to come to the temples. They come in small minivans, sometimes two to a seat, traveling during the heat of the day on bad roads, sleeping in the vans at night, sometimes dealing with bandits, and crossing borders which are difficult&ndash;&ndash;all at great financial cost to them. And yet they come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember being on an assignment in the Ivory Coast to reorganize a stake presidency in Abidjan. One of our Area Seventies was with me as we interviewed the 40 priesthood leaders in the stake trying to find who the Lord wanted to be the stake president. One by one as they came in I would ask them if they had been to the temple in Accra. At that time it had been operating for about 18 months. For many big smiles spread across their faces as they told us they had been and had their wives and children sealed to them. Others hadn&rsquo;t been so blessed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember one faithful priesthood leader with tears in his eyes, saying, &ldquo;President, we have been saving our money to go to the temple. Hopefully this year my wife and I will be able to go and maybe take one of our six children to be sealed.&rdquo; My heart ached for them as I thought of my own children. How could I decide which child I would take? Thankfully, because of the General Temple Patron Assistance Fund, we were able to assure that this faithful Ivorian brother and all his family were able to go to the temple and be sealed together forever. You will remember in October 2011 General Conference that President Monson encouraged those who wished to contribute to this worthy fund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Hinckley&rsquo;s counsel to the Ghanaian Saints to pray daily, search the scriptures, attend their meetings and pay their tithing is not only &ldquo;very important&rdquo; to the Ghanaian Saints, but it is equally important to each of us. It is wise counsel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, we are living in a great day and age. How blessed we are to live during the dispensation of the fullness of times; when the gospel has been restored in it fullness. We are blessed to live at a time when temples are dotting the earth so that all of our Heavenly Father&rsquo;s children may receive the blessings that are found in no other place than the House of the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Child and I count our blessings every day. How blessed we are to live within five minutes of the Salt Lake Temple! I hope you realize how blessed you are to have the beautiful Rexburg Idaho Temple here in your midst. I hope you are taking advantage of the great blessing it can be in your life and the lives of those who have gone before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear my witness that we have a kind, loving Heavenly Father who loves all of His children. I know that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. I am grateful we have living prophets on the earth today and bear witness that President Thomas S. Monson is the Lord&rsquo;s mouthpiece in the world today. May our Heavenly Father&rsquo;s choicest blessings be with you always is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>It is a privilege to again be here at BYU-Idaho today. I never come to Idaho without thinking of wilderness. I suppose that is because there is so much beautiful and pristine wilderness in this state. I first experienced Idaho wilderness nearly 40 years ago when I brought a group of Explorer Scouts from California for a 100-mile &ldquo;run&rdquo; down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River. I am sure there are those in this audience who have likewise visited that wilderness. What an experience!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me it was magnificently challenging! The scenery is breathtaking. The rapids and the whitewater get one&rsquo;s adrenaline flowing freely! In fact, I was washed out of our raft twice in the rapids during the course of that trip! It was an experience that I shall never forget!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My thoughts turn to a different wilderness of personal experience; this one in the swamps of Florida. As a part of the rigorous training to become a U.S. Army Ranger, I spent three weeks in those swamps on Eglin Air Force Base in northern Florida. This was not nearly the delightful experience of the Middle Fork!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Night after night we slogged in pitch-blackness. You could not see your hand in front of your face. All that was visible were two luminous tabs on the back of the cap of the man in front of you. Venomous snakes slithered between our legs; alligators bellowed. Burdened with rifles and equipment, sometimes we would step into sloughs and find the water over our heads. It was a tough and challenging experience, but completion of that phase of training brought a special exhilaration and feeling of accomplishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My ultimate wilderness experience occurred in the jungles and rice paddies of Vietnam. I was an infantry platoon leader. Our combat missions took us deep into enemy controlled territory. On one occasion, our battalion was engaged in moving at night through &ldquo;Indian country.&rdquo; We were going cross-country through an area of rice paddies checkered with patches of jungle, employing armored personnel carriers as our means of transport. Sometime well after dark, the vehicle I was riding in became deeply mired in a rice paddy bog. Three other vehicles became similarly mired not far away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not wanting to slow the movement or leave the battalion strung out in a potentially vulnerable column, the battalion commander elected to continue moving. He left me in command of the four stranded vehicles with the &ldquo;reassurance&rdquo; that he would send a reinforced party back to our aid once it was daylight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, there we were; some 20 men in four stranded personnel carriers strung out over about a quarter of a mile in enemy territory. It was tense! I made my way from one to the next to check on the welfare of the troops and their supply of ammunition. This was also an &ldquo;adrenaline experience&rdquo;&mdash;not only because of enemy soldiers that might be lurking in the blackness, but because my men were anxious and potentially trigger-happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somehow, I made it safely to each one and back to my own vehicle. I then called in artillery fire to register concentrations around our position that might be needed if we were suddenly attacked. In addition, I asked for the artillery to fire flares periodically over the surrounding area, enabling us to see the battlefield more clearly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is difficult in the tranquil setting of this devotional to adequately convey the sense of security that came from these flares that would illuminate the landscape. Truly, they were a light in the wilderness!&nbsp; In a manner of speaking, it is about &ldquo;light in the wilderness&rdquo; that I would like to speak this afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilderness&rdquo; figures prominently in scripture. For instance, sometimes the Lord has employed the wilderness as a &ldquo;finishing school&rdquo; of sorts to tutor and prepare His children. Moses and the children of Israel&rsquo;s 40 years in the wilderness are just such an example. John the Baptist thrived in the wilderness on &ldquo;locusts and wild honey&rdquo; as he prepared for his ministry as the forerunner of Jesus Christ.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wilderness has served as a venue for intense prayer and fasting. The Savior Himself departed into the wilderness for a period of 40 days of such deep spiritual preparation before entering upon His mortal ministry, culminating in His titanic confrontation with Lucifer, testing and strengthening His mastery over the Evil One.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, the wilderness has served as a temple&mdash;a sacred place for sacred experiences. Moses went up into a mountain and there spoke face-to-face with the Lord, &ldquo;as a man speaketh unto his friend.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup> The Brother of Jared and Nephi each went up into a mountain to receive instruction for building a ship or barges.<sup>4</sup> These were the most sacred of occasions where these men, who would become holy prophets, were provided eternal insights into the God of the universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And sometimes a wilderness experience has been even more than these. Sometimes, living the wilderness experience has provided a metaphor for life itself. Such is the case with the wilderness experience about which I have chosen to speak this day. I refer to Lehi&rsquo;s profound dream in the wilderness about the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the wilderness&rdquo;&mdash;this is a phrase that is used 23 times in the book of 1 Nephi in referring to the experiences of Lehi. Dismayed by the wickedness around him in Jerusalem and prompted by the Spirit of the Lord, Lehi left behind all of his worldly possessions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart <em>into the wilderness</em>. And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him. And it came to pass that he departed <em>into the wilderness</em>, <strong><em>and</em></strong><em> he left his house</em>,<em> <strong>and</strong> the land of his inheritance, <strong>and</strong> his gold, <strong>and</strong> his silver, <strong>and</strong> his precious things, <strong>and took nothing with him</strong>, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness&rdquo;</em> (1 Nephi 2:2-4; emphasis added).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine how difficult that would be! To leave everything behind, the comforts of wealth and finery, pleasant associations, and the relative ease of urban life, trading it all for the privations of wilderness living&mdash;and not for a just few days, a week, a month, or even a &ldquo;tour of duty,&rdquo; but for years, even the rest of your life!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wilderness as a metaphor for the mortal experience itself is evident in one of the most remarkable visions every recorded. I refer, of course, to Lehi&rsquo;s vision of the Tree of Life, as recorded in 1 Nephi 8. I shall focus today on what you and I can distill from it regarding this mortal &ldquo;wilderness experience&rdquo; that we are now enduring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verse two of chapter eight is significant: &ldquo;And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the wilderness, he spake unto us, saying:&nbsp; Behold, I have dreamed a dream; or in other words, I have seen a vision (1 Nephi 8:2).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While he was in the wilderness, Lehi had a vision. Visions&mdash;inspiration&mdash;can come &ldquo;in the wilderness&rdquo; if, like Lehi, we are engaging the wilderness as though it were a temple. Now, I do not suggest that we need to go into the Idaho primitive area, or into the swamp, or the jungle to receive revelation. Quite the contrary, I do mean that we are already living in a wilderness&mdash;this wilderness we call mortality&mdash;and that, like Lehi, we can experience revelation in this wilderness. But we must look upon this wilderness experience as a time of refinement, or, to quote the words of another Book of Mormon prophet, as a &ldquo;time to prepare to meet God&rdquo; (Alma 12:24, 34:32). Visions come in the Lord&rsquo;s time, not in our own time; but Lehi&rsquo;s experience teaches that they do come if we are preparing for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note how this exceptional revelatory experience begins. In his vision, Lehi said that, &ldquo;I saw a man and he was dressed in a white robe; and he came and stood before me.&nbsp; And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow him&rdquo; (1 Nephi 8:5-6). And Lehi did follow the man in the white robe, an angel.<sup>5</sup> Significantly, Lehi then records, &ldquo;And it came to pass that as I followed him, I beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste. And after I had travelled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy on me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies&rdquo; (1 Nephi 8:7-8).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wilderness, by its very nature, is &ldquo;lone and dreary.&rdquo; Even though its beauty in some cases may be magnificent&mdash;like the Middle Fork wilderness area&mdash;the difficulty of subsistence and sometimes the difficulty of the path through it can make it seem both &ldquo;lone&rdquo; and &ldquo;dreary.&rdquo; And in this mortal wilderness, new inspiration may not flow moment by moment. As Elder Dallin H. Oaks once observed, we believe in &ldquo;continuing,&rdquo; not &ldquo;continuous,&rdquo; revelation.<sup>6</sup> There are simply times when navigating the wilderness of life that answers&mdash;even important answers&mdash;we are seeking are not yet clear; but we move forward anyway with a confidence in revelation already received coupled with earnest prayer and an unshakeable trust in the Lord that He will yet &ldquo;have mercy on [us with additional direction], according to the multitude of His tender mercies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lehi&rsquo;s righteous perseverance in his vision did not go unrewarded. Notwithstanding the darkness and the difficulty of the way that he initially encountered in attempting to follow the &ldquo;man in the white robe,&rdquo; he persevered, and in due course he came upon &ldquo;a large and spacious field,&rdquo; and in that field he &ldquo;beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy. And it came to pass that [he] did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and [he] beheld that it was most sweet, above all that [he] ever before tasted&rdquo; (1 Nephi 8:9-11). And then the culmination of his personal experience&mdash;Lehi records: &ldquo;<em>And as I partook of the fruit thereof, it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy</em>&rdquo; (1 Nephi 8:12, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reaching the tree and tasting of the fruit, Lehi then began to discover other details in the vision that had previously eluded him. For one thing, he noted that there was &ldquo;a river of water; and it ran along, <em>and it was near the tree</em> of which I was partaking of the fruit&rdquo; (1 Nephi 8:13; emphasis added). Nephi, who was permitted to see the same dream, advises us that this was a river of filthy water representing, of course, the evils of the world. Its close proximity to the tree of life reflects the built-in tension of the mortal experience as you and I know it. The principles of happiness and righteousness found in the gospel of Jesus Christ unfortunately are not far removed from the evil that we see all about us. Even in those moments when we feel close to the Lord, the adversary is never far away. You and I daily face the temptations of that filthy river that would sweep us away from the &ldquo;tree of life&rdquo; were we to allow that to occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But thankfully, we learn from Lehi that the Lord has not left us in such a precarious position unaided. For running beside the river of water, between the tree of life and the chasm of the river, he saw a rod of iron extending along the bank of the river. This rod of iron, we learn from Nephi, is the word of God. As we grasp it&mdash;meaning as we study and strive to emulate scriptural and modern prophetic teachings&mdash;we cannot be swept away in Lucifer's torrents, though we may see them raging about us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest four lessons to be distilled from Lehi&rsquo;s vision that can help us personally. I believe that they pertain particularly to you, the &ldquo;rising generation,&rdquo; who in so many respects are standing upon the very threshold of life. I believe that if you can keep these four lessons in mind as you move forward with your education, with your occupations, with your service in the Church and community, and most of all, as you move forward to establish your families, you will negotiate the perils of the wilderness magnificently and enjoy the unspeakable happiness of the &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; of the tree of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the four lessons:</p>
<p>Remember! The fruit of the tree sustains in the wilderness. Devour it!</p>
<p>Remember! The iron rod brings safe passage through the wilderness. Grasp it!</p>
<p>Remember! Opportunity is created by the wilderness. Seize it!</p>
<p>Remember! Roses bloom, even in the wilderness. Take time to smell them!</p>
<p>I turn now to a brief discussion of each of these four lessons. First, remember! The fruit of the tree sustains in the wilderness. Devour it! As I look back over my own &ldquo;wilderness experiences,&rdquo; I cannot do so without some humorous memories. For instance, the Ranger course was entirely devoted to learning to lead long-range combat and reconnaissance patrols in wilderness areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the training was learning to live off the land, while carrying relatively small amounts of food with us. As a means of assuring that none of us Ranger candidates cheated by stuffing our pockets with goodies, the Ranger cadre established a simple rule that was strictly enforced: each man was allowed to carry no more than what they referred to as two &ldquo;lickies&rdquo; and one &ldquo;chewy.&rdquo; For example, this would mean two packages of Lifesavers and one candy bar. Occasionally, the cadre would conduct unannounced inspections to make sure that the &ldquo;licky and chewy rule&rdquo; was being observed. I still remember one unfortunate Ranger candidate found with an entire box of candy bars!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Vietnam wilderness there was no such &ldquo;licky and chewy rule.&rdquo; We ate primarily C-rations&mdash;&ldquo;combat rations&rdquo;&mdash;that we could carry with us. But, sometimes a hot meal was ferried out to us by helicopter in a jungle clearing somewhere and served from insulated containers. I still recall, as though it was yesterday, what feasts these jungle meals seemed to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the spiritual wilderness of mortality, there is no such lack of sustenance&ndash;&ndash;provided we are willing to seek it. The fruit of the tree of life that brought such joy to Lehi&mdash;the love of God&mdash;is in rich abundance. But, like the manna that sustained the ancient Israelites, this fruit must be picked daily. The fruit of the tree is to be found in the holy scriptures. It is to be found in our earnest prayers. It is to be found in service to others&mdash;in avoiding any inclination to becoming self-absorbed. It is to be found in the temple of the Lord. But, like manna, this spiritual sustenance has a limited shelf life and must be replenished constantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so it is that as we navigate our way through this mortal wilderness, we can choose to be amply nourished or not. A lack of spiritual sustenance is a self-imposed privation. We can attempt to survive on the spiritual equivalent of a can of C-rations or a couple of &ldquo;lickies&rdquo; and a &ldquo;chewy&rdquo; if we want, or we can feast constantly at the table of the Lord. The choice truly is ours. The fruit of the tree sustains in the wilderness. Devour it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now to the second lesson. Remember! The iron rod brings safe passage through the wilderness. Grasp it! Once again, as I wander the corridors of memory, another wilderness experience from my Ranger training days emerges. Three weeks of the training were conducted in the Blue Ridge Mountains of north Georgia&mdash;also a wilderness, by the way! In addition to honing our patrolling and combat skills at the Mountain Ranger Camp, we learned to scale steep cliffs and then to rappel down them. The mountain phase of my training occurred in the winter. Snow was on the ground and slick black ice covered much of the face of these cliffs we were ascending and descending. It was treacherous, and some Rangers fell and were seriously hurt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of us chose a &ldquo;Ranger buddy&rdquo;&mdash;another Ranger with whom we went through the training. One day, my Ranger buddy and I were ordered to scale a steep cliff in a &ldquo;two-man party climb.&rdquo; In a two-man party climb, one man climbs while the other &ldquo;belays&rdquo; for him with a safety line. Then the first man belays while his partner climbs past him to a further place up the cliff, and so on as the team leapfrogs its way to the top.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, naturally, on this fateful day we searched along the base of the cliff for what looked like the easiest way up. We found a spot where the cliff did not appear to be nearly as steep. For the first 25 feet or so it was only about a 45-degree angle. While we couldn't see beyond that point, it still looked like the easiest way up the cliff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My buddy went first while I belayed for him. Climbing up the 45-degree slope, he disappeared around a corner of the rock wall. Finally, a tug on the rope was my signal to climb up to his location and then past him. When I reached his location and looked up, I was stunned to see that, from where we were, the wall shot straight up into the air and then curved back overhead in a rocky overhang. It was now my task to scale the sheer face of the wall and then to somehow climb up that overhang using rope stirrups that I fastened into the wall with steel pitons, or rock-climbing nails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have vivid memories of dangling from that rocky overhang with one foot in a rope stirrup, looking down from the dizzying height of 100 feet at the ground below, while I attempted to fix another rope stirrup further up the rock face. Exhausted, I finally made it over the edge of the cliff at the top and assisted my partner as he climbed up to where I was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cliff-climbing experience has become something of a parable in my life about the foolishness of trying to find the easy way out of things. It is significant to me that the iron rod in Lehi&rsquo;s dream extended along the &ldquo;straight and narrow path leading directly to the tree.&rdquo; This way may not always be &ldquo;easy&rdquo; in the sense my partner and I were seeking when we climbed up the cliff, but nonetheless, when compared to the consequences of falling into the &ldquo;filthy river,&rdquo; there is always an &ldquo;easiness to the way&rdquo; of the Lord as Alma reminded Helaman.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is indeed a close proximity in this world between good and evil. You and I are aware of it every day. Our scriptures sit on a shelf in our homes or apartments next to a television set or computer that is capable of bringing all manner of filth into our lives. In the midst of our best efforts to think good thoughts and to be filled with the Spirit, we so often find ourselves bombarded by Satan&rsquo;s missives. It really is true: in this world the tree of life with its marvelous fruit is not far from the river of filthy water. But, the straight and narrow path and the iron rod beside it stand between us and the filth. We need but to hold on tight to the iron rod as we move along the path. The iron rod of principle is always there. Grasp it and hold on tight!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turn now to my third injunction to you. Remember! Opportunity is created by the wilderness. Seize it! Near the end of his life, as recorded in the second chapter of second Nephi, Lehi&mdash;having lived now so many years in the wilderness&mdash;made this profound observation: &ldquo;It must needs be that there is an opposition in all things.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup> An &ldquo;opposition in all things&rdquo; is indeed a principle of life. There really is no easy way up the cliff!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, I have spoken about the &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; that exists between the principles of righteousness and the wiles of the adversary. But now I turn to another &ldquo;opposition&rdquo;&mdash;a close &ldquo;cousin&rdquo; to the first&mdash;that appears in this wilderness of mortality. I speak of the opposition of ease, of the failure to make the effort to succeed and accomplish. We live in a &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; environment. We want to sit in our car and order our food and then pull up to a window in a restaurant where it is handed to us. We want air conditioning everywhere. Instead of going to see a friend, or even telephoning him, we send a text. Rather than exert ourselves in a real physical contest, we are too often content to enjoy a virtual one in front of a computer or television screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, there is nothing wrong with these modern conveniences and technological marvels. We all enjoy them. The problem becomes when technology and convenience infect our thinking with the idea that we must always drift to the &ldquo;easy way.&rdquo; My young friends, life is challenging! There really is no easy way! Hard work, study, and determination are as essential in today&rsquo;s world as they ever were in previous eras. And the good news is that it is the &ldquo;opposition in all things&rdquo;&mdash;the difficulty&mdash;that creates the opportunities for those willing to make the effort to seize them!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some may remember the film, <em>A League of Their Own, </em>which was in theatres a number of years ago, starring Tom Hanks and Geena Davis. It is a film about a women&rsquo;s baseball league created during World War II when most male athletes were overseas fighting the war. Tom Hanks plays the role of a gin-soaked, gimpy former all-star, turned coach. Geena Davis plays the role of the star player on his team. When her husband returns home from fighting in Europe unexpectedly, the Geena Davis character decides she wants to leave the team and return home to Oregon with her husband. When confronted by Tom Hanks as to why she is leaving at a critical point in the season, she declares that it had simply become &ldquo;too hard.&rdquo; Now, I will be the first to admit that it is not often when Hollywood comes up with a line in a movie that is worth remembering! But Tom Hanks&rsquo; response to the &ldquo;too hard&rdquo; statement in this movie is worth remembering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Said he, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s supposed to be hard. If it wasn&rsquo;t hard, everyone would do it; the hard is what makes it great!&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young people, the hard is what makes it great! A willingness to enroll in the challenging classes, to set worthwhile goals and a timetable for meeting them that require effort and stretching oneself&mdash;these are the qualities of character that lead inevitably to success in this life simply because those who are willing to make the effort are the ones who will find and seize the opportunities that mortality&rsquo;s natural circumstances create. At the end of the day, it may not be the subject matter of a particular class&mdash;or the specifics of the goals and timetable&mdash;that will have mattered. What will have mattered is that in not taking the easy way&mdash;in following the more challenging path&mdash;you will have developed a character that hungers for challenge and that seizes opportunity when it presents itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beloved young people, I have lived more than seven decades now. I admit that hardly seems possible! But I am here to tell you&mdash;more than anything else, and whether we are talking about spiritual or temporal things&mdash;I have learned this one lesson above all others: there is no easy way up the cliff! Remember always this lesson of life&mdash;in opposition there is opportunity! Seize it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I come now to my fourth &ldquo;wilderness lesson.&rdquo; Roses bloom, even in the wilderness. Take time to smell them! When I urge you to move forward toward life and career with vigor and purpose, I mean to suggest a brisk, purposeful march, not a headlong, pell-mell sprint that shuts out everything else that is worthy and enjoyable in a beautiful world, leaving you exhausted, empty, and &ldquo;burned out.&rdquo; In my experience, if some of us are seduced by the trial of ease, others of us become bewitched by the pursuit of fame and fortune to the exclusion of all else. Balance is needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By way of illustration of that point&mdash;and the beauties that are out there for our enjoyment if we will but pause to do so&mdash;I share with you this piece that appeared a few years ago in the <em>Washington Post</em>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man sat at a metro station in Washington DC and started to play the violin; it was a cold January morning. He played six Bach pieces for about 45 minutes. During that time, since it was rush hour, it was calculated that 1,100 people went through the station, most of them on their way to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three minutes went by, and a middle-aged man noticed there was a musician playing. He slowed his pace, and stopped for a few seconds, and then hurried up to meet his schedule. A minute later, the violinist received his first dollar tip: a woman threw the money in the till and without stopping, and continued to walk. A few minutes later, someone leaned against the wall to listen to him, but the man looked at his watch and started to walk again. Clearly he was late for work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who paid the most attention was a 3 year old boy. His mother tugged him along, hurried, but the [lad] stopped to look at the violinist. Finally, the mother pushed hard, and the child continued to walk, turning his head all the time. This action was repeated by several other children. All the parents, without exception, forced them to move on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 45 minutes the musician played, only 6 people stopped and stayed for a while. About 20 gave him money, but continued to walk their normal pace. He collected $32. When he finished playing and silence took over, no one noticed it. No one applauded, nor was there any recognition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knew this, but the violinist was Joshua Bell, one of the most talented musicians in the world. He had just played one of the most intricate pieces ever written, on a violin worth $3.5 million dollars. Two days before his playing in the subway, Joshua Bell sold out at a theater in Boston where the seats averaged $100.&rdquo;<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>The music is out there. Listen for it! Roses really do bloom in the desert! Take time to smell them! So, here they are, once again&mdash;my four wilderness lessons:</p>
<p>The fruit of the tree sustains in the wilderness. Devour it!</p>
<p>The iron rod brings safe passage through the wilderness. Grasp it!</p>
<p>Opportunity is created by the wilderness. Seize it!</p>
<p>Roses bloom, even in the wilderness. Take time to smell them!</p>
<p>My thoughts take me once again down my hall of memories of nearly a half-century to a dark night in a Vietnamese jungle clearing and the reassuring flashes of artillery flares that provided light in the wilderness. Lehi&rsquo;s experience stands as a metaphor for us all. There really is vision&mdash;light&mdash;in the wilderness of mortality. We need only have the eyes to see it. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p>On this day, April 6, the anniversary of the founding of the Church and, as revealed in scripture, of the birth of our Savior Jesus Christ, and on this day, the day of your graduation, it is a privilege to be with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am honored to be invited to speak to you. I understand from a friend of mine that the longest commencement speech ever given was six hours at Harvard in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. It was delivered in Latin, then Greek, and finally in English. The shortest was delivered by the late Nels Smith, former governor of Wyoming. When it came his turn to speak, he arose slowly from his chair, approached the podium, surveyed the rows and rows of gowned graduating students, and speaking slowly simply said, &ldquo;You done real good.&rdquo; Then he turned and sat back down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I can promise you I will not deliver my speech in Latin or Greek, but it will be a little longer than Governor Smith&rsquo;s. As I look at you, my heart is overflowing with love for each of you graduates and for you moms and dads who have sacrificed so much to make this day possible. You are all to be congratulated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bring the love of our prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, the First Presidency, and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. We pray for you often asking Heavenly Father to bless you in your preparation for your future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also felt your love and the sustaining power of your prayers. I can tell you, with a heart full of gratitude, it is because of the prayers of the Saints we are able to fulfill the demands of our callings, especially as some of us are not so young any more. Hopefully, in my 83 years of living I have learned a few things that will help you on your way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This activity this evening is aptly called &ldquo;Commencement&rdquo; because you will now be moving on to the next phase of your life, a beginning or commencement, if you will. The conditions in the world you are about to encounter are filled with uncertainty and danger. The economies of the world and of the United States are unstable and unpredictable. The cherished values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are under attack by those who want to restrict agency and make you dependent rather than encouraging your skills and talents to create new and exciting ways of doing things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standards of morality are failing. The family is under attack and is crumbling. Love in the hearts of men has waxed cold and is unnatural. There is a continuing breakdown in the integrity, honesty, and righteousness of political, business, and other leaders. Wars and rumors of wars between nations and creeds abound. And even more destructive than any armed conflict is the war raging between good and evil&mdash;a war for the very souls of men&mdash;between the Savior and His army of light against Satan and his evil minions of darkness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley described the world you are about to enter when he said, &ldquo;We live in a season when fierce men do terrible and despicable things. We live in a season of war. We live in a season of arrogance. We live in a season of wickedness, pornography, and immorality. All of the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah haunt our society. Our young people have never faced a greater challenge. We have never seen more clearly the lecherous face of evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should not be surprised at all of these circumstances of our time because the scriptures and prophecies of our day testify of what will happen in the world if the people turn their backs toward God. And you know that we will yet experience some unpleasant things for the devil continues his attempts to accomplish his evil designs. At the same time, the prophets of old who saw our day, who saw your generation, knew this time&mdash;your time&mdash;would be an age of light and wonderment such as the world has never before experienced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I prepared for this talk today, I asked for guidance to know what message our Heavenly Father would want me to share with you. The calming and assuring words spoken by the Lord to Joseph Smith came to my mind: &ldquo;Be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours&hellip;and the riches of eternity&rdquo; (D&amp;C 78:18).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I believe the Lord wants me to tell you is that you should replace fear with faith&mdash;faith in God and the power of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. I can remember as a young 13-year-old boy coming home from priesthood meeting on Sunday, December 7, 1941, to learn from my parents that Japan had just bombed Pearl Harbor. This propelled the United States into a world war that had already been raging in Europe for two years. It seemed like life as we knew it was going to come to an end. There was much uncertainty as many young men were swept up into military service. However, now just as then, amidst all of the conflicts, struggles, and evil influences in the world, there is still much of good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you think about your future, you should be filled with faith and hope. Always remember that Jesus Christ, the creator of the universe, the architect of our salvation, and the head of this Church is in control. He will not permit His work to fail. He will be victorious over all darkness and evil. And He invites us all, members of His Church and others who are the honest in heart, to join in the battle for the souls of men. Along with all else we will do in life, we must also dedicate and consecrate our heart, might, mind, and strength to His cause, walking in faith and working with conviction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Face the future with optimism. I believe we are standing on the threshold of a new era of growth, prosperity, and abundance. Barring a calamity or unexpected international crisis, I think the next few years will bring a resurgence in the economy as new discoveries are made in communication, medicine, energy, transportation, physics, computer technology, and other fields of endeavor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of these discoveries, as in the past, will be the result of the Spirit whispering insights into and enlightening the minds of truth-seeking individuals. Many of these discoveries will be made for the purpose of helping to bring to pass the purposes and work of God and the quickening of the building of His kingdom on earth today. With these discoveries and advances will come new employment opportunities and prosperity for those who work hard and especially to those who strive to keep the commandments of God. This has been the case in other significant periods of national and international economic growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the Savior&rsquo;s second coming&mdash;and based on His divine timetable&mdash;the gospel must be taken to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people until it fills the whole earth. And as the Prophet Joseph declared, &ldquo;no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the great Jehovah shall say the work is done&rdquo; (Documentary History of the Church, Vol. 4, 540).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the gospel is carried to the billions of spiritually hungry souls, miracles will be performed by the hand of the Lord. Missionaries of many nationalities will serve the Lord throughout the earth. New chapels and many more temples will be built to bless the Saints as pre-millennial growth has been prophesied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may ask, &ldquo;Where will the financial resources come from to fund this growth?&rdquo; The resources will come from faithful members like you through your tithes and offerings. As you graduates do your part, the Lord will bless you with prosperity and the wisdom to keep your mind focused on what matters most in your life: &ldquo;But seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you&rdquo; (Matthew 6:13).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, for yet a season, possibly a short season, it will seem as though the windows of heaven will have truly opened so that &ldquo;there shall not be room enough to receive it&rdquo; (Malachi 3:10). I believe you graduates sitting here today will be active participants in temporal blessings if you keep the commandments of the Lord. With prosperity will come a unique challenge&mdash;a test that will try many of you to your spiritual core. As you step into this new world of prosperity and engage in converting your education into financial success, you will always have to control wants vs. needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will have two choices. Will your motivation to build and acquire the blessings of the Lord be for personal gratification, the recognition of men, for power, influence and self-aggrandizement? Or will your motive be to glorify God, working to help usher in the growth and expansion of His Church?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who seek riches to build up their own egos will find their treasure to be slippery and easily lost in unwise ways. The welfare of their souls will be in great jeopardy. Jacob, the obedient younger brother of Nephi warned us concerning this wealth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly, that you have obtained many riches&hellip;yet you are lifted up in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff necks and high heads because of the costliness of your apparel&hellip;do ye suppose that God justifieth you in this thing? Behold I say unto you, Nay. But he condemneth you, and if ye persist in these things his judgments must speedily come unto you&hellip;let not this pride of your hearts destroy your souls!&nbsp; (Jacob 2:13-14,16).</p>
<p>Jacob then put our motivation to acquire wealth in the proper perspective with a promise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good&mdash;to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted&rdquo; (Jacob 2: 18-19).</p>
<p>The Lord is not telling us that we should not be prosperous or that prosperity is a sin or is evil. On the contrary, He has always blessed the obedience of His people with prosperity. He is telling us that we should seek prosperity only after we seek, find, and serve Him. Then, because our hearts are right, because we love Him first and foremost, we will choose to invest the riches we obtain in building His kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose to seek riches for the sake of riches, you will fall short. You will never be satisfied.&nbsp; You will be empty, never finding true happiness and lasting joy. The trial of your faith, my dear brothers and sisters, in the next few years to come will likely not be that you lack the material things of this world. Rather it will be in choosing what to do with the temporal blessings you may receive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of you and your generation, President Ezra Taft Benson said: &ldquo;For nearly six thousand years, God has held you in reserve to make your appearance in the final days before the Second Coming&hellip;God has saved for the final inning some of His strongest children, who will help bear off the kingdom triumphantly&hellip;You are the generation that must be prepared to meet your God&rdquo; (&ldquo;Stalwart and Brave We Stand,&rdquo; quoted by Marvin J. Ashton, <em>Ensign</em>, November 1989, 36).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, to be a vital part of the marvelous work and wonder in these last days, you must submit your will to God, letting it be swallowed up in His will.&nbsp; As you press forward &ldquo;with a steadfastness in Christ,&rdquo; with a &ldquo;brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men...feasting upon the word of Christ,&rdquo; (2 Nephi 31:20) searching diligently, praying always, and believing, then, as the Lord promises, &ldquo;all things will work together for your good&rdquo; (see D&amp;C 90:24).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I urge you to make a commitment to yourself and to Heavenly Father to dedicate your life and consecrate your time and talents to the building up of the Church of Jesus Christ in anticipation of the Savior&rsquo;s second coming. Let the motive of your thoughts and actions be to glorify God and to bless your fellowman. Let this desire inspire you to greet each new morning with enthusiasm, let it fuel your thoughts and actions throughout each day. If you do this, you will be blessed in the midst of a world that is fast losing its way, and you and your loved ones will be secure and happy. This does not mean that you will not face trials and tests, but it does mean you will have the spiritual power to handle them with faith and trust in the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear graduates, the purpose of my message is to help you envision your future. Have faith and hope for the bright future you face as you leave BYU-Idaho and move on to your next great adventure. You young men are the future fathers, &ldquo;a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light&rdquo; (1 Peter 2:9). You young women are the future mothers and nurturers of God&rsquo;s own spirit sons and daughters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For both men and women, one of your top priorities is to find your eternal companion, if you have not already done so. Marriage in the temple will provide you with a companion to help you stay on the right path that leads back to the presence of our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. You are the generation that will continue the preparation for the Second Coming.</p>

<p>I am grateful to be in attendance today to add my congratulations to the graduates for this important accomplishment. I also express my gratitude and admiration to family members and friends of the graduates who have made this achievement possible. Thanks also go to faculty, staff, and administration at this wonderful university who do so much to bless the lives of these students. I am very grateful for those who support this institution financially, including members of the Church throughout the world who are faithful tithe payers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The excitement and adventure of launching on a new part of life is in the air at graduation time. You have been here long enough that life as a student is normal for you, but you are now leaving that behind and are facing significant change. Some of you are beginning careers, others are still looking for work, some are headed for further education, some of you will be home as a spouse continues school or begins a career, and many of you will be moving. It is exciting. It is exciting in part because you don&rsquo;t know exactly what the future will bring. In fact, if you think your life will roll out exactly as you have it planned, get ready for some surprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been thinking about our own experience as I graduated many years ago. My wife had already graduated by the time I finished. We were excited about that next step in our lives.&nbsp; It was early August of 1978. We borrowed my father&rsquo;s very old pickup truck and an open top cattle trailer to move all our belongings from Provo, Utah to Chandler, Arizona to begin our career. We had never been there before, and we were excited, and also a little nervous. We left our one-year-old daughter with my parents, packed up the truck, and trailer and headed for Arizona. We had only traveled about 60 miles when the truck started handling strangely and was making some bad noises. We pulled over and discovered one of the wheels was in the process of falling off. The lug bolts had stripped and the rim of the wheel was also ruined. It was getting late so we just slept by the side of the road that night and in the morning hitchhiked into town to get a new rim and have the lug bolts replaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we continued our journey we eventually made it into Arizona, and began hearing frequent reports on the radio about a massive manhunt for Gary Tison and Randy Greenawalt, two convicted murderers, and three of Tison&rsquo;s sons who had helped the two escape from prison. The officials were saying that the members of the Tison gang were armed and extremely dangerous and cautioned drivers not to stop and help anyone nor stop for any reason by the side of the road. After the escape, the gang&rsquo;s car had gotten two flat tires, and a young family had stopped to help them. The young man, 24 years old, his wife, 23 years old, their one-year-old son and a teenage niece were all killed and their car was taken. At the time I was 24 and my wife was 23. It was a little too creepy. As we drove, we kept hearing updates and news flashes and as we started up the steeper freeway sections on the way to Flagstaff the truck began to overheat. Several times we had to do what the police were saying not to do&ndash;&ndash;pull off the side of the road and wait for the engine to cool down. Thankfully, we never ran into the Tison gang, but this drama added to the sense that our lives were entering a very different chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We did eventually make it to our destination, unloaded our belongings and then headed back to retrieve our daughter and return to that new phase of life. Many years have passed since then and those years have been an exciting adventure for our family. We have had years of raising children and graduate school. We have had changes in job assignments and Church callings. We have had great friends and neighbors in the places we have lived. We have faced the normal challenges tied to this mortal existence. Our perspective is so different looking back from our current stage in life. Our life did not turn out like we planned, but now it is easy to see the Lord&rsquo;s blessings through all those years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what is ahead for each of you. No two people walk the same path. But I do know that the Lord will help guide you as you take both the academic and the spiritual learning you have obtained here and move forward with faith, no matter how your life unfolds. When Nephi was commanded to build the ship for their journey to the promised land the Lord explained how he would help them on this journey. He said, &ldquo;&hellip;I will&hellip;be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye shall know that it is by me that ye are led&rdquo; (1 Nephi 17:13).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Nephi, the Lord will guide you on your journey through life if you keep the commandments, and later you will be able to look back and see how the Lord has guided and blessed you through the years. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p>Sister Clark: We are grateful for the opportunity to speak to you at the beginning of this spring semester on another great day at BYU-Idaho. We love you very much and pray the Spirit will be here with us today that we might feel our Heavenly Father&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: When I was about four years old, my mother took me shopping in downtown Salt Lake City. While my mother was shopping, I wandered off to explore the store. Very soon I was lost. I can still remember what I felt. I was frightened and worried and very sad. I must have started to cry because one of the clerks found me. It was not long before I saw my mother coming for&nbsp;me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As my mother held me in her arms, feelings of happiness and joy flooded my little boy heart and soul. I was just a small child, but the Lord blessed me with a taste of the joy and happiness of heaven in my mother&rsquo;s love and in the safety of her arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: That happiness and joy President Clark felt as a little boy is not meant to be a momentary experience in life. Indeed, the Prophet Joseph taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;[God] has &hellip;given [us] power to &hellip; pursu[e] the pathway of holiness in this life, which brings peace of mind, and joy in the Holy Ghost here, and a fullness of joy and happiness at His right hand hereafter. . . .&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: No matter what our circumstances are, no matter what happens to us, if we act with faith in Christ to keep those laws, principles, and ordinances that govern joy and happiness in God&rsquo;s eternal plan, the Holy Ghost will be with us. Happiness and joy will be a foundation in our lives and a part of our very character and identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The theme of our message today is Nephi&rsquo;s description of the way his people lived:&nbsp; &ldquo;And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: Brothers and sisters, we want you to be happy! We want you to walk the path of holiness, a way of life that will bring you joy and happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come. We want you to learn to live after the manner of happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our talk has three parts. First, we will discuss Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan of happiness and the central role of the Atonement of Christ in that plan. Second, we will focus on what we must do to live the plan. Third, we will address the challenges to happiness we face and how to overcome them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I.&nbsp; The Great Plan of Happiness</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>President Clark: Before we came to earth, we lived with our Heavenly Father in the premortal realm. We knew Him and loved Him and felt His love for us. That was a time of learning and preparation.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;As the Proclamation on the Family states in language plain and beautiful:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All human beings&mdash;male and female&mdash;are created in the image of God.&nbsp; Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshipped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize their divine destiny as heirs of eternal life. . . .&nbsp; Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: The plan of happiness contains beautiful promises, but we cannot obtain them on our own. In order to be tried and tested, we have to live in a fallen world<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;where we have to use our agency. We must choose to obey God&rsquo;s laws in the face of opposition from temptation, evil, natural disasters, sickness, and death.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;All of us sin, and all of us suffer physical death. Without divine help, we would be separated from our bodies and from Heavenly Father forever because we do not have the power to overcome death and sin.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;We need a Savior, a Redeemer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: And so Heavenly Father sent His Firstborn Son to be the Savior of all mankind. Brothers and sisters, the way to life and happiness now and forever is the Lord Jesus Christ. His life, ministry, atoning sacrifice, and glorious resurrection make the great plan of happiness a reality. Indeed, &ldquo;men are, that they might have joy.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Jesus Himself taught this sublime doctrine to His disciples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold . . . this is the gospel which I have given unto you . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: When we act with faith in Jesus Christ to repent of our sins and live the fullness of His gospel, we are living the plan of happiness. Through the power of His atoning sacrifice, the Savior forgives us of sin and purifies and changes our hearts. Through His redeeming love, we have &ldquo;joy in the Holy Ghost&rdquo;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;and we become more and more like the Savior and our Heavenly Father. This is what it means to live after the manner of happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>II.&nbsp; Living the Plan</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: In order to guide us in this process of becoming, Heavenly Father has given us a divine pattern to follow. That pattern is eternal life, the life that He and His Beloved Son live.&nbsp;Three aspects of eternal life create a powerful plan of action in our quest to live after the manner of happiness. They are: be holy, do divine work, and create a celestial family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Be Holy</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: The Father and the Son are perfect in every way. They are supremely good and holy. The Father said to Enoch, &ldquo;Man of Holiness is my name.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Jesus received a fullness of the Father&rsquo;s glory and, like Him, embodies a fullness of every virtue, every good thing, including joy and happiness. As Alma taught, happiness is in God's nature.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: The plan of action is clear: repent and be cleansed from sin through the mercy and grace of Jesus Christ. Remember, &ldquo;wickedness never was happiness.&rdquo;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Happiness is living the gospel of Jesus Christ. As Jesus taught the Samaritan woman at Jacob&rsquo;s well:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.&rdquo;<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: When we drink of the living water, the fullness of the gospel goes down deep in our hearts. As we act with faith in Christ to receive sacred ordinances and keep the associated covenants, we become more holy. The power of godliness is manifest in our lives, and the Holy Ghost blesses us to love as Christ loves and serve as He serves. We become more and more like Him, and happiness becomes part of our identity and our nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Do Divine Work</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: Heavenly Father declared to Moses, &ldquo;[T]his is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.&rdquo;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;It is good to remember that for the Father and the Son, this supernal work of love and service is work! The Father and the Son work as they design, create, plan, organize, direct, govern, watch over, teach, inspire, reveal, and bless. Eternal life is a life of meaningful, sacred, and divine work. It is God&rsquo;s glory and thus His happiness and joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: The plan of action is simple: go to work! Do the divine work the Lord has given us to&nbsp;do. Our work is to love God and obey His commandments with all our hearts.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Our work is to support our families through diligence and hard effort.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Our work is to plant and weed and harvest by the sweat of our brow and with all the strength the Lord gives us. Our work is to learn&mdash;to grow in knowledge, understanding, and intelligence.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Our work is to develop our talents and add more talents.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Our work is to love and serve our brothers and sisters and share our gifts and blessings with them &ldquo;as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.&rdquo;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Our work is to let the light of Christ shine in us that others may feel and see Him through us.<sup>21</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we do our work, &ldquo;seeking the interest of [our] neighbor and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God,&rdquo;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;that work will be a source of happiness and joy to us and to those we serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Create a Celestial Family</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>President Clark: The family is central to the plan of happiness because eternal life is family life.&nbsp; God is our Heavenly Father; &ldquo;we are the [spirit] children of God.&rdquo;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;God loves His children and cares for them<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;by teaching and preparing them for mortal life<sup>25</sup>&mdash;giving them guidance, gifts, blessings, ordinances and covenants, and the power of godliness through faith in His Son.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;There is in the Father&rsquo;s celestial family a complete and perfect unity of love and truth. The Father rejoices in His righteous children and lives in a fullness of happiness and joy with His eternal family.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: The plan of action is plain to see: prepare for celestial marriage and an eternal family, no matter when those blessings may come to you. Seek out and find an eternal companion and be sealed for time and all eternity in the holy temple of the Lord. Bring children into your eternal family&mdash;love and care for them, teach them the gospel, and help them grow up in light and truth with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The family is the place of mortal life&rsquo;s greatest joys as well as its greatest sorrows. It is in the creation of a celestial family that we learn to love, serve, and sacrifice. A &ldquo;celestial marriage [and family] bring greater possibilities for happiness than . . . any other relationship.&rdquo;<sup>28</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>III.&nbsp; Overcoming Challenges to Happiness</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: Brothers and sisters, when we repent of our sins and live the gospel, when we receive the ordinances of salvation and keep our covenants, when we work hard to support our families, when we increase in learning, when we serve and help others, when we are sealed in the holy temple to a beloved companion, when we create a celestial family and rear children in light and truth&mdash;we live after the manner of happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: This does not mean that our lives are full of happiness every minute of every day; we all experience challenges to happiness. Yet, as Elder Richard G. Scott has taught, the challenges we face can be only episodes in a life of happiness:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life never was intended to be continually easy. &nbsp;It is punctuated with periods of proving and growth. . . .&nbsp; When you conquer adversity . . . you are rewarded with satisfying happiness. &nbsp;Through that means you will confirm that life can be lived on a continuing foundation of happiness.&rdquo;<sup>29</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: Opposition is part of Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan. Sometimes opposition to happiness comes from things that happen to us. Sometimes opposition comes from things we do to ourselves. No matter where the challenges to happiness come from, the questions for us are: do we overcome them, or do they overcome us? As we work to overcome life&rsquo;s challenges, we gain experience, grow in faith, and add to our foundation of happiness.&nbsp;We want to consider with you today three challenges to happiness that seem especially important for us. We begin with pain and suffering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Pain and Suffering </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Sister Clark: Pain and suffering come to all of us. Illness, accidents, death, natural disasters, depression, disappointments of all kinds, and the actions of others cause physical and emotional pain and suffering. They disrupt our happiness. Our family has faced many such challenges over the years. They seem to come in bunches. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: In February of 1998 my mother died unexpectedly of a blood clot in her lung. On the day of her funeral in St. George, Utah, we received word that our son Jonathan had been run over by a truck on a remote highway in Minnesota. The message was that he was alive, but badly injured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: In May of 2004 our daughter Julia was diagnosed with Hodgkin&rsquo;s disease, a cancer of the lymph system. She came home from college to undergo several months of chemotherapy. While Julia was home, I was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent major surgery that September.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: From these experiences, and from many others, we have learned that the pattern of holiness the Lord has given us helps us overcome the effects of pain and suffering. Here are the lessons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;trust in His love, mercy, and power, and in His timing. Resist thoughts of anger, bitterness, or despair. Act with faith in Christ to do His will, no matter what comes. Remember, the Savior sees the end from the beginning. His will is the very best thing that could ever happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: Nurture your personal spiritual and physical strength. When hard times come, we need strength of body and spirit. But hard times often cause us to stop doing the very things that bring personal strength. Don&rsquo;t stop exercising and eating right. When challenges come, continue to seek holiness in your life. Pray, search, and ponder the scriptures. Worship in the temple. Serve the Lord, and stay close to the Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: Serve someone else. It is true that when we suffer we need support and love. Those around us can bless us immensely with their care and concern. However, when we face affliction, we have a tendency to turn inward and become self-absorbed. That is a sure path to misery. Serving someone else gets us outside of ourselves. It opens channels of love, inspiration, and heavenly blessings. It is a sure path to overcoming suffering and finding happiness once again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: Embrace the plan of happiness. Remember, pain and suffering are part of the plan. Instead of asking questions like, &ldquo;Why do we have to suffer?&rdquo; ask, &ldquo;What does the Lord want us to learn from this experience?&rdquo; Out of that kind of question comes gratitude for the Lord&rsquo;s love and tutoring, even when the experience is very hard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: Last fall I learned this lesson in a powerful way. In August I had a kidney transplant. I had come to know that this was the Lord&rsquo;s plan for me. I decided to embrace the plan, including all of the pain and suffering it would entail&mdash;the surgery, the hospital, the recovery, the changes in my life&mdash;all of it. I was blessed with a deep conviction that this was the Lord&rsquo;s plan for new life for me, and I chose to embrace that plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the first day in the hospital (after surgery that morning), with a catheter in my neck and with lots of other tubes and catheters in me, I said to Sue, &ldquo;I have loved every moment of this day.&rdquo; It hurt. I had a tough road ahead; but Sue was by my side, and the Lord blessed me to feel happiness and joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Mask of Indifference </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: The second challenge to happiness is the mask of indifference. People sometimes put on a public face that is blank with no smile, no expression, and no light in their eyes. That face is like a mask that isolates them from other people; it is the mask of indifference.&nbsp;We know from the pattern of divine work the Lord has given us that loving and serving others are important sources of happiness and joy, both in this life and in the eternities. In the plan of happiness, the Lord commands us to be of good cheer and to let our light shine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: An important way we do that is to live so that the light of the Spirit is in our eyes and in our countenance. This is divine work and is the way we overcome the mask of indifference. When we have a genuine smile, greet people with a kind word, and reflect our love of God and His children in our eyes and in our faces, we bring light and happiness to those we meet. We also feel good because we express outwardly the truth we feel in our hearts. In this small and simple way, we keep our covenants and do divine work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: Smiling and greeting people with friendliness, however, runs counter to norms in modern society. It is pretty standard practice in many parts of our country to put on the mask of indifference. The mask reflects fear and a desire not to get involved with people we don&rsquo;t know. The basic rule of thumb seems to be: if you don&rsquo;t know the people, don&rsquo;t acknowledge them; don&rsquo;t smile, and don&rsquo;t make eye contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: Our experience at BYU-Idaho has been very different. It is a great blessing to be on this campus where there are so many warm and friendly people whose countenances reflect the light of the Spirit and who greet one another in a spirit of love and kindness. When we walk on campus, it is our practice to greet the people we pass on the sidewalk. It is inspiring to see so many of you with a ready smile and light in your eyes. It makes us happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: Yet, we encounter some students who wear the mask of indifference. When we greet such students, sometimes the mask stays on and we get no response. That happens most often when the person with the mask also has loud music blaring in her ears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually, however, the student with the mask recognizes us and reacts. The mask comes off, the student smiles, and the light shines. The light was in there, but the mask hid the light. We are happy when we see the mask drop and the light shine; but we also think to ourselves, &ldquo;How sad that this wonderful person passed so many fellow students and did not smile, did not say &lsquo;good morning,&rsquo; and did not let the light of the Spirit shine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: Brothers and sisters, if we put on the mask of indifference, we disrupt our own happiness and lose opportunities to bring light to others. If you wear the mask of indifference, please get rid of it. If it is your practice to stick music buds in your ears and listen to music while you walk between classes, please stop it. Take off the mask, and unplug your ears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want you to put on an act or pretend. We want you to live with the Spirit in your hearts. &nbsp;We want you to share it in these simple ways in a spirit of friendliness and Christlike love. We want you to do divine work.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The Cultures of the World</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: We now turn to the third challenge to happiness, the cultures of the world. All of us grow up in a culture of traditions, customs, expected attitudes, values, and patterns of living. The culture we grow up in reflects the influence of our family, our local and regional society, and even our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cultural influences may affect our attitudes and our behavior. Not all of those influences are consistent with the gospel. Cultures of the world very often reflect the desires, appetites, and passions of the natural man. Worldly cultures may cause us to do or say things that disrupt our happiness and the happiness of those around us. Living the divine pattern for creating a celestial family is the way to overcome the influence of worldly cultures. Here are two examples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: Example 1&ndash;&ndash;Some young men and women grow up in a worldly culture in which going on a date means that you are &ldquo;girlfriend-boyfriend.&rdquo; In this culture dating comes only after a lot of hanging out and includes sexual intimacy. The attitudes and expectations in this culture are inconsistent with the teachings of the prophets and gospel patterns of dating. As Elder Dallin H. Oaks counseled young men:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gather your courage and look for someone to pair off with. Start with a variety of dates with a variety of young women, and when that phase yields a good prospect, proceed to courtship. It&rsquo;s marriage time.&rdquo;<sup>30</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young people caught in a worldly culture of dating may desire to have a celestial marriage; but if they are not very careful, the values of their old culture may slip into their relationships with one another. They may postpone dating and marriage; they may enter into marriage unprepared; they may become unworthy of a temple sealing. The traditions of this culture are a path to poor decisions and terrible unhappiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: Example 2&ndash;&ndash;A young man grew up surrounded by a culture in his family and local community in which verbal, emotional, and even physical abuse by husbands and fathers was tolerated and even accepted. In the part of the United States where he grew up, he had seen and heard of many instances of such abuse and had seen it accepted. If that cultural pattern has become part of him, he will bring to marriage attitudes and traditions wholly inconsistent with the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He may have many other good qualities and may desire a celestial marriage; but if he is not very careful, his old culture may slip in and cause contention and even physical abuse of his wife. Such violence may have been common in his culture, but it is evil and will destroy his marriage and his family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: We all need to be aware of the worldly cultures that affect us. Cultural influences may be very subtle and hard to detect. We must be careful and check our attitudes and behavior against the gospel patterns of marriage and family and reject that which is wrong. Happily, we are not trapped by the worldly cultures of our past. Through the Atonement of Christ, we can repent and be free of poor attitudes and sinful behavior. If we give our hearts to the Savior, He will help us overcome the world and create a celestial family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Clark: I express my gratitude to Heavenly Father and to our Savior Jesus Christ for the gift of the plan of happiness. I know that joy and happiness in this life are only available through the pattern They have given us. If we live that pattern, our joy and happiness will be eternal. It is my prayer that we will follow that pattern every day. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark: My brothers and sisters, Heavenly Father lives and wants us to have true joy and happiness. He loves us so much that He has given us His great plan of happiness, and He has given us His Son. I bear witness of Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer. He lives! The way to happiness and joy, now and forever, is in His Church and in Him. It is my hope and prayer that we will come unto Christ, embrace the plan, and live after the manner of happiness. I leave you with my witness and my love, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, I count it a privilege to associate with you. You are amazing young people whom I respect very much. You bring a wonderful spirit to this campus. When I teach Family History and read the biographies of my students, I am touched by the challenges I realize each of you is facing. I testify with Alma that the Savior can lighten your burdens (Alma 33:23), give you success and comfort (Alma 31:32), and succor you according to your infirmities (Alma 7:12). There is no manner of affliction you can suffer that cannot be swallowed up in the joy of Christ (Alma 31:38).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am intrigued with a connection we find at the end of the Book of Mormon between hard, frightening days, and the need to have faith, hope and charity. Each of these words&mdash;faith, hope, and charity is centered in Christ and can help us find joy in life. Each of these concepts interconnects and strengthens the others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Faith</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We exercise faith in Christ in many ways&ndash;&ndash;through sincere repentance, through loving service, and through righteous obedience. Those who falter and then are redeemed through the atonement gain a powerful love of Christ. Occasionally, we hear somebody go so far as to say they are grateful they sinned because of the joy and insights they gained through their repentance. However, my belief is that anyone who has truly repented of a sin wishes they could go back in time and pass the test they failed. What those who repent are really saying is not that they are grateful they sinned, but that they are amazed the Savior was able to turn something so negative into something so positive. They are grateful for redemption, not the thing that made them need to be redeemed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of my favorite friends&ndash;&ndash;heroes I have come to love and respect&ndash;&ndash;are those who have had the faith and courage to seek forgiveness. However, even more impressive, and less celebrated in my estimation, are the accomplishments of those who exercise the faith not to fall. When temptations become powerful, they use the example and power of the Savior to control passions, to forgive, or to remain faithful in spite of adversity. They use the atonement to succeed instead of just using it to rectify failure. Elder David A. Bednar explained that &ldquo;the infinite atonement is for both the sinner and for the saint in each of us&rdquo; (CR, November 2007).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you remember Robert Frost&rsquo;s poem about two roads that diverged in a yellow wood and the gratitude he felt for having taken the one less traveled? He knew that way leads on to way and that we often do not come back from detours (<em>Mountain Interval.</em> New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1920). While walking in the right direction just makes sense, it is also more exciting and positive to forge ahead on the productive path of the saint than retracing the thorny path of repentance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the three great kings of Israel&ndash;&ndash;Saul, David, and Solomon&ndash;&ndash;all fell in spite of the amazing potential they possessed. They did much good, but each failed a test that destroyed their lives. Conversely, before the Savior began His mission, He also faced Satan and modeled the process whereby we refuse to be driven from greatness. I believe the accounts of the Savior, Joseph, and Moses all conquering Satan are provided as a pattern for us&mdash;not mythical stories that are impossible to duplicate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, we can be forgiven of sin through the atonement, but we can also overcome sin through Christ. His commandments, example, ordinances, and power can make it possible for us to succeed in life where we would otherwise fail. Indeed, the Savior intends to save us from our sins, but not in them (Helaman 5:10). As Elder Bednar once taught, &ldquo;Our spiritual purpose is to overcome both sin and the desire to sin, both the taint and the tyranny of sin&rdquo; (CR, November 2007). Often, these victories are painful to claim, and represent the actions of a very mature saint. The young man who looks away, the young woman who will not compromise standards, the priesthood holder who forsakes gaming, the couple who prepares for the temple and prioritizes the family, all do so through great <em>faith.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, life&rsquo;s doors swing on small hinges. Many of us are facing tests right now that will be pivot points on which the rest of our life will swing. President Thomas S. Monson taught us about the importance of refusing to be tossed to and fro by the winds of the world by sharing a story from his childhood concerning boat races. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The toy boats of childhood had no keel for stability, no rudder to provide direction, and no source of power. Inevitably, their destination was downstream&mdash;the path of least resistance. Unlike toy boats, we have been provided divine attributes to guide our journey. We enter mortality not to float with the moving currents of life but with the power to think, to reason, and to achieve&rdquo; (CR, April, 2012).<em> <br /></em></p>
<p>The process of recognizing when we are drifting in the wrong direction and choosing to change our course is a vital responsibility we each possess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On one occasion, one of my daughters came to me and asked me to keep her cell phone for a week. She said that she felt it was consuming too much of her time and attention and she wanted to reset her priorities. I put her phone on a shelf and she reclaimed it a while later. I loved the desire for self-mastery she demonstrated and the introspective analysis she practiced as she sought to act and not be acted upon (2 Nephi 2:26).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was your age, people didn&rsquo;t talk much about addictions, and when they did they were usually discussing problems associated with the Word of Wisdom. Sadly, your society no longer helps you recognize and avoid deception. Each of you must individually choose to stay free and useful in spite of the electronic haze in which you live. Ours is a day of addictions that cause us to relinquish our role in this great final battle. I testify that you have agency and you have power. You can choose to free yourselves from addictions small and great. You can follow the counsel of Lehi when he said: &ldquo;Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust&rdquo; (2 Nephi 1:23).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Satan is striving to cause us to become weak, pathetic victims. However, you are not victims&mdash;you are soldiers with a cause. President Boyd K. Packer once said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you say, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t solve my problems!&rsquo; I want to thunder out, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize who you are? Haven&rsquo;t you learned yet that you are a son or a daughter of Almighty God? Do you not know that there are powerful resources inherited from Him that you can call upon to give you steadiness and courage and great power?&rsquo;&rdquo; (Ensign, August 1975)</p>
<p>As you choose to win significant battles in life, remember the power of fasting. It can &ldquo;loose the bands of wickedness&hellip;undo the heavy burdens, and&hellip;let the oppressed go free&hellip;that ye break every yoke&rdquo; (Isaiah 58:6). Additionally, remember the afflicted woman in the book of Mark who had received all the help the world could give her and was still not well. However, when she touched the hem of the Savior&rsquo;s garment, in faith believing that she would be made whole, virtue flowed into her and she was healed (Mark 5:25-34). Finally, follow Helaman&rsquo;s example and gain determination by thinking about your goals in life, your spouse, your children, and your desires to be free (Alma 58:12).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tests many of us are facing would not be categorized as resisting sin so much as fighting distraction and selfishness. I challenge you to make an inventory of how you are using your electronic devices. You can still unwind with them and use them to recharge. But, see if you can also increase the good you do with them. They have the ability to prepare you to serve. They can help you save your brothers and sisters on both sides of the veil in a way that has never before been possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure you remember the story of Esau despising his birthright and selling it for a mess of pottage (Genesis 25). Sadly, the way we use the amazing electronic empowerment we have been given may be similarly shortsighted. What if you played &ldquo;Zithor the Megahunter&rdquo; for one hour instead of three? You could then order an e-book on the atonement from Deseret Book and read the first chapter during the time you would have been destroying Zithorian moon bases? As you make adjustments in your usage of electronics, you might consider one or more of the following ideas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than reserving your creative efforts for class assignments, perhaps you will be like Nephi and &ldquo;labor diligently to write, to persuade your children, and also your brethren, to believe in Christ and to be reconciled to God&rdquo; (2 Nephi 2:23, emphasis added). You will be able to come up with ideas that match your personal circumstances and interests. Such efforts to reorder your day-to-day activities will put wind in your sails and help you feel the joy of self-mastery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hope</strong></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As we exercise the faith to obey, we begin to acquire hope. Hope reinforces our faith as we seek to pass the tests of life. Hope in Christ has been equated with an &ldquo;earnest expectation&rdquo; (Philippians 1:20). It is behaving according to a firm belief in how things will unfold. It is expecting, not wishing. Hope orients our lives. Hope keeps our eyes focused on eternity. Hope-filled individuals cherish eternal promises enough to cling to them through trials and distractions, while those who lack hope give up what they want most for what they want at the moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon provides a good example of the difference hope can make. Years before Lehi&rsquo;s family built the ship to take them to the Promised Land, Sariah complained about her boys being sent back for the plates. Lehi comforted Sariah by explaining the effects of hope in his life. He said: &ldquo;Behold, I <em>have</em> obtained a land of promise, in the which things I <em>do</em> rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness&rdquo; (1 Nephi 5:5, emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sariah was unable to find comfort and joy until the boys returned. Lehi, on the other hand, was able to find peace and confidence because his trust in God's promises enabled him to respond to life as though the things he earnestly expected had already occurred. Do you realize that you can claim peace and joy today because of your promised opportunity to marry, or the fact that you will one day be reunited with a loved one that has died, or the assurance that your sickly body will be made perfect? As you plow through the difficulties of life, remember Paul&rsquo;s admonition to &ldquo;plow in hope&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 9:10). Let us follow the lead of Enos when his faith and hope in God allowed him to say that he knew that things &ldquo;would be according to the covenant which he had made; wherefore my soul did rest&rdquo; (Enos 1:17).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The immutable promises of God allow you to face the vicissitudes of life calmly. The temporary withholding of a promised blessing does not trouble those who keep their eyes riveted on the eventual fulfillment of the promise. Moroni explained that this kind of hope begins with faith and becomes &ldquo;an anchor to the souls of men which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God&rdquo; (Ether 12:4). I testify that God is omniscient and omnipotent, and therefore able to fulfill any promise. You can trust in this assurance from Him: &ldquo;I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them&rdquo; (Isaiah 42:16).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Charity</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith and hope can change our lives. They help us productively face all of our challenges. However, the greatest change we will experience will result from the acquisition of charity. As the Savior's mortal ministry was ending He sought to help Peter bring closure to his training as a disciple. Just after the last supper, Jesus pled with Peter saying, &ldquo;When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren&rdquo; (Luke 22:32).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter responded to this plea from the Savior by saying, &ldquo;Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death&rdquo; (Luke 22:33). Obviously, Peter felt fairly certain he would not disappoint the Savior. However, he had some painful experiences awaiting him as he finished his preparations to become the leader of the Church. Following the resurrection, Peter still had not fully arrived at the point where he possessed the vision and capacity to fulfill the Savior's command to strengthen his brethren. After experiencing the most glorious event in the history of the world&ndash;&ndash;the resurrection of Jesus Christ, Peter remained somewhat aimless. Instead of walking the streets shouting the message, Peter said, &ldquo;I go a fishing&rdquo; (John 21:3). Because their leader chose this course, the other disciples went with him. These choices set the stage for the visit of the Savior to the brethren at the seashore that is recounted in John 21.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After discovering Jesus on the seashore, Peter must have looked around and realized he was not in a position to share the wonderful message he had witnessed with the world. Once again, he found himself embarrassed by his inability to translate his knowledge into appropriate action. John, who wrote more symbolically than any of the gospel writers, then stated, &ldquo;Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher&rsquo;s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea&rdquo; (John 21:7).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you take this verse literally, it seems a little absurd. If Peter were barely clothed in a boat, why would he put on a coat before diving into the water to swim? However, taken symbolically, it becomes beautiful. Is it possible that the emotions Peter felt standing in the ship could best be described as feeling naked? Did he feel defenseless and embarrassed standing before the Savior doing what he was doing considering what he knew? Did putting on his fishers coat symbolize a point where a permanent clarity and commitment was achieved? Did Peter remember his call three years earlier when the Savior asked him to leave his nets and begin fishing men? Does it sometimes take a surprising amount of time for us to grow from loving Christ to finally being focused on loving His children?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the seashore, the Savior completed Peter's transformation. With this final tutelage, Peter put on, and kept on, the mantle of his call to leave the cares of the world and invest himself in fishing men. First, the Savior reviewed what Peter had caught saying, &ldquo;Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes&rdquo; (John 21:10-11). We should remember that our acquisitions are actually made possible by God. Peter caught nothing before the Savior assisted with his temporal nets. Similarly, God has filled all of our nets abundantly. However, His help is given as a means to an end&ndash;&ndash;it must not become an end unto itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciating our blessings and understanding why we received them will orient our lives. Occasionally, the many possible problems that lurk around the corner cast a shadow on today. We worry about natural disasters, economic collapse, and war. We worry even more about the spiritual poisons that surround us. In the midst of so many concerns, we can struggle with insecurity and depression. We may want to put off families, or disengage and pretend there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the moments where charity can help us to stay involved and interested without becoming disillusioned. True charity frees us from selfishness. When we are focused on wanting things, we are vulnerable to losses. When we orient our lives around service and building the Kingdom, we become somewhat immune to financial reverses or temporal challenges. Think how unimportant the fish were to Peter as he stood before the Savior. At that moment, they were nothing more to him than a tool provided to help him work. The person who is focused on building the kingdom, sharing the gospel, and preparing for the Second Coming views these days as being filled with exciting opportunities that dwarf the pursuit of riches. The humble person guided by charity, knows happiness can occur in small homes and old cars. Like Paul, they have learned how to be content in any circumstance (Philippians 4:11-12). They revel in seeing days prophets have dreamed of, and doing things that have never before been possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possessing charity dissolves worry and instills purpose. Rising above ourselves frees us from fear. We become filled with gratitude for the privilege of being part of the great winding up scenes of the world. This change in perspective makes all the difference in facing the future with joy, gratitude, and excitement. When we view our blessings as being given to us so that we can build the Kingdom, rather than as a means to fulfill selfish desires, life resolves into a choice adventure. This change in perspective steels us to face our fears and find purpose in life. Note the difference between Ammon and his companions as they guarded sheep for King Lamoni. When men threatened them and scattered the sheep, Ammon&rsquo;s companions &ldquo;wept because of the fear of being slain&rdquo;, but Ammon&rsquo;s &ldquo;heart was swollen within him with joy&rdquo; because he would be able to show the power that was in him and win the hearts of his fellow-servants so that they would believe in his words (Alma 17:29).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of us must endure the troubling introspection of Peter when the Savior held up the symbol of his life pursuits and asked &ldquo;Peter, lovest thou me more than these?&rdquo; How sobering would we find it if the Savior held up to us something other than a fish&mdash;perhaps something we spend our money or time upon? What if He pointed to our devotion to texting, social media, video games, or music? What if He asked us three times the same question about our devotion to Him versus our feelings for one of those distractions? Is there something God wants you to do that you keep putting off because of something else you love in life?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that Peter finally embraced the second step of his discipleship on the seashore. He was now ready to focus on strengthening his brethren. He had been converted years earlier, and had come unto Christ. Now, he was finally ready to consistently help bring God's other children to Christ. Arriving at this second stage of discipleship is what we should each seek to achieve. When we do, God and His Church are able to quit worrying about us and start using us to help others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as Peter felt naked when he caught a glimpse of things as they really are, we should be stirred to the depths of our souls when we review the comparison between what we know and what we do. As we are humbled by our nakedness we must choose to put on our fisher&rsquo;s coat and start approaching those around us more appropriately. We need to wrestle with the reasons we spend so much time discovering and chewing on people's faults and so little time rejoicing in their successes and strengths. We need to ask ourselves why we gossip and judge when we plan to serve and build. When loving, laughing, and accepting are so delightful, why do we so often choose emotions which weigh us down? We need to ask ourselves why we don't invest more of our prayers in the needs of others. Why does our focus remain on getting more blessings for ourselves when we understand the purpose of life as clearly as we do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do we fail to share the gospel, care for the poor and the needy, or engage in family history and temple work because we have not mustered the love for others that would motivate us to action and sacrifice? When the Savior taught that we find our lives by losing them, was he trying to help us understand how important it is for us to stop worrying about ourselves and start focusing on the needs of others? Charity refocuses us so that we do not let the fish in our lives keep us from noticing the good we could be doing. Feelings of charity serve as an antidote to self-absorption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1840, Alexis de Tocqueville completed the second part of his famous analysis of democracy in America. In spite of his admiration for the robust forms of democracy in America, he had concerns about how our interactions with our government would affect us. On one occasion he predicted that over the years, democracy could produce a group of people who:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn about without repose in order to procure for themselves petty and vulgar pleasures with which they fill their souls. Each of them, withdrawn apart, is a virtual stranger, unaware of the fate of the others: his children and his particular friends form for him the entirety of the human race; as for his fellow citizens, he is beside them, but he sees them not; he touches them and senses them not; he exists only in himself and for himself alone&rdquo; (Paul A. Rahe, 2009. <em>Soft Despotism, Democracy&rsquo;s Drift: Montesquieu, Rousseau, Tocqueville, and the Modern Prospect. </em>Yale University Press: New Haven, Connecticut. p. 187).</p>
<p>Tocqueville feared that our society would produce people that became so materialistic that they would obsess over petty things at the expense of grand and noble pursuits. Over 170 years ago Tocqueville was befuddled at the tendency for Americans to be discontent and unhappy because they &ldquo;dream constantly of the goods that they do not have&rdquo; (ibid, p. 180). He stated that an American behaves as though his singular concern is to &ldquo;distract himself from the happiness that is his&rdquo; (ibid, p. 180). He worried that a people who initially treasured freedom and liberty would allow a taste for comfort and materialism to stupefy them into losing the ability or inclination to use their will in meaningful pursuits (ibid, p. 184).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tocqueville&rsquo;s prescient insights serve as a piercingly accurate description of our society. The scriptures teach that in the last days &ldquo;the love of many shall wax cold&rdquo; (Matthew 24:12) and that Satan will pacify and lull many away into carnal security (2 Nephi 28:21). I believe that charity saves us from the aimlessness and disillusionment that is plaguing our society. Charity inspires us to gather people in a world that seeks to scatter them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that our use of faith, hope, and charity will determine our happiness and our success. We must pass difficult tests of our faith in a quest to become more Christ-like. In addition to exercising faith, we must identify the things we hope for, and let them orient our lives and lend purpose to our daily choices. When we marry, we are not doing so because of what our partner and relationship is, but because of our earnest expectation of what they will become over the years under the influence of these attributes we have discussed today. Finally, we must put off the natural man and become a saint through the atonement of Christ so that our basic disposition changes (Mosiah 3:19; Mosiah 5:2). We accomplish this by praying to the Father with all the energy of our hearts so that we may be filled with the pure love of Christ (Moroni 7:48). I know these things are true; I pray that I can improve at doing them.</p>

</p>
<p>Today I would like talk about who we are, what we can become, and how this relates to our journey through mortality. We need to own a deep understanding of these principles&mdash;an understanding that will help us through this life and qualify us for the highest blessings of eternal life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I served a mission for the Lord in the Wisconsin Milwaukee Mission, and my first area was in the heart of Milwaukee. Living in a city like Milwaukee was a new experience for me. I spent a handful of years leading up to my mission living in the smaller town of Pleasant Grove, Utah. One of my first experiences with public transportation occurred within the first few weeks of my mission. I was with my trainer traveling on a city bus. We had done a lot of walking one day and decided to finish off the late afternoon riding the city bus. I remember I was tired and still a little overwhelmed with the whole mission experience. We did not have a lot of success contacting people that day, and I remember sitting down exhausted and spent on that cramped city bus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon after we settled in, the person in front of us turned around and started talking to my companion and me. At first we were very hopeful and excited that someone actually wanted to talk to us. We let him know we were missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and that we taught people about Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It soon became apparent that this individual was not looking for sincere conversation; instead, he was looking to pick an argument. Also, instead of engaging my trainer, he started to engage <em>me</em> with conversation. After a few rounds of questioning, he asked me directly &ldquo;How many books are in the Bible?&rdquo; I felt this question was not that relevant to anything&mdash;plus I didn&rsquo;t know the number&mdash;so I tried brushing him off, but without success. He became fixed on this question and started asking it in a louder voice. He could tell that I did not have the answer and was going in for the attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other people on the bus started paying attention to the conversation and it started turning into a public display. He asked again, &ldquo;How many books are in the Bible?&rdquo; and added &ldquo;How can you teach about Christ if you don&rsquo;t even know the Bible?&rdquo; I started singing the seminary song in my head&mdash;Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers&mdash;and counting at the same time. I learned I can&rsquo;t sing a song in my head and count at the same time because I kept losing count early in the Old Testament. I started to feel nervous because I was representing the Lord, and the attention on the bus was drawn towards me. I was concerned that I wasn&rsquo;t being a good elder or a good servant and that people would walk away believing that Latter-day Saint missionaries didn&rsquo;t know the Bible. I looked to my trainer for help but this man would not let my companion answer the question. He could sense the &ldquo;greenie&rdquo; target on me and was honing in on it. I vividly remember him pointing his finger at me saying, &ldquo;I am talking to you, not him.&rdquo; Also, my trainer gave me a look suggesting I could handle this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember praying that this conversation would end and that the man would turn around. As I did so, I remember being prompted to bear my testimony of who the Bible testifies of: Jesus Christ. I explained that I did not know how many books are in the Bible; however, I know <em>what</em> is in the Bible. I testified of Jehovah in the Old Testament and of Jesus Christ in the New Testament and that they are one, our Savior. I remember feeling the Spirit and the power of the Lord as I bore my testimony. And something powerful happened: the man stopped. He let go of the issue and turned around without challenging my testimony. It was apparent he wasn&rsquo;t interested in further sincere dialogue. I said a silent prayer the entire way home and expressed thanks to the powers above for help. And when I got back to my apartment, guess what I immediately did? I pulled out my scriptures and counted how many books were in the Bible. There are 66 just in case you find yourself in a similar situation. I remember thinking that if the only thing you know about the Bible is the number of books it has, you don&rsquo;t deeply understand and are missing out on so many of its teachings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, from a deep level, let&rsquo;s explore who we are and what we can become. A person who I admire greatly and trust without reservation once told me that if people truly know who they are, they will <em>never</em> sell their birthright for a mess of pottage. He also told me that we must understand this concept deeply to not sell our birthright. He was referring to the story found in Genesis 25. Esau and Jacob were the twin boys of Isaac and Rebekah, and the grandchildren of Abraham. Even though they were twins, Esau was born first and was technically the oldest meaning the birthright blessing was his. Esau was a hunter and one day he came home very hungry. He saw that Jacob had made some pottage so he asked Jacob if he could have some.&nbsp; Jacob agreed, but on a condition: Esau had to give him his birthright. Thus, Esau <em>literally</em> sold his birthright for a mess of pottage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mess of pottage has been used as an analogy for something of little importance. So if we truly know who we are, we won&rsquo;t sell our birthright for something of little importance. I will share two teachings that illustrate who we are and what we can become. The first teaching is from The Family: A Proclamation to the World: &ldquo;All human beings&mdash;male and female&mdash;are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that we are the spirit children of God; I know that I am a Son of God. I know we all have a divine nature and destiny. There is something sacred and special in all of us. Never forget that. The second teaching is from Romans 8. Please notice that this perspective shares an important qualifier with the associated blessings:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God (there is the qualifier), they are the sons of God. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is the associated blessing that I want to emphasize today:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.&nbsp;For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us&rdquo; (Romans 8:14,16-18).</p>
<p>If we are led by the Spirit, we all have the potential to be heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ.&nbsp; In the footnote to verse 17 that refers to <em>heir</em>, it shares with us further topics to study: birthright; election; eternal life; exaltation; man, potential to become like Heavenly Father. Birthright may mean different things, but when comparing who we really are to our birthright, I am referring to the perspective found in the footnote, the greatest gift that Heavenly Father can give us: eternal life. I also appreciate how Paul ties in the sufferings of mortality and compares those struggles to who we really are. I believe there is an important relationship between them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would now like to shift gears and talk about our journey through mortality and how that relates to our divine heritage. Mortality is an interesting place, full of fallen individuals&mdash;all of us.&nbsp; Also, a place full of challenges, or, as Paul wrote to the Romans, &ldquo;sufferings of this present time&rdquo; (Romans 8:18). I want all of you to think for a moment about what the sufferings of the present time may be. Some of these sufferings may seem unbeatable and unconquerable. We may see ourselves as small and insignificant in comparison to them. Some of these sufferings may be sin; they may be fulfilling duties and responsibilities that seem too big and too many. Some of these may be uncertainty about future events at home and around the world. They may be difficulties in relationships or challenges in study. Because we are fallen, we are imperfect. So to top off these sufferings, we have imperfect, fallen people trying to navigate through them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without knowing who we truly are, it would be easy to become overwhelmed with mortality. It would also become easy to forget the value of our birthright. That is why I love the scripture in Romans. It reminds us who we can be and how that knowledge goes hand-in-hand with principles of eternal life. It also reminds us to not get caught up in the challenges of mortality or &ldquo;the sufferings of our present time.&rdquo; It reminds us that those sufferings cannot be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us, or who we really are. It gives an eternal perspective. We will remember that when the price of something is our birthright, our eternal potential is not for sale because the value of the situation cannot be compared to who we really are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind, mortality is all part of the plan. The Lord is in charge. I believe this plan refers to the big plan&mdash;the Plan of Salvation&mdash;and also our individual plans along the way. I want to share an experience that shows the Lord is in charge on a personal level, and then I will then talk about the bigger plan we all chose in the pre-mortal life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a brother who experienced kidney failure. For over a decade his kidneys kept failing and during this time, the family knew he would eventually need a kidney transplant. There are six boys in my family and he asked each of us if, when the time comes, we would consider donating a kidney. At the time the answer was easy because it seemed so far away. We all said yes. I am the youngest of the six boys and my brother is 10 years older than I am. In good fun, I would tell him if I was the eventual donor he could average the age of his internal organs and reduce his overall age by a few years. I actually think he may have started doing that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About two years ago, the joking stopped because his kidneys were completely shutting down, and to survive he would either need to begin dialysis or receive a kidney transplant. He asked all of us brothers the same question: &ldquo;Will you donate a kidney?&rdquo; I can imagine how hard it must have been for him to ask that question knowing what a donor might go through. We all said yes and began the testing. I passed my initial screening with flying colors. I also passed the next phase. The next test was to determine if we were a match. The results came back and showed we were a very strong match; as strong as a match can be when the donor and recipient are not identical twins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now things were starting to get serious. I was being narrowed down as the donor. In fact, my other brothers paused their testing to wait and see what would happen with me. By this time I only had one test left: a psychological analysis to see if I could mentally handle being a donor and to evaluate my decision. They needed to make sure I was not being forced, coerced, or rewarded financially.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout all of this I remember thinking how much I really wanted to be the donor. Deep down within myself I know why I wanted to donate, but to this day I can&rsquo;t articulate why. They are feelings that are difficult for me to put into words.&nbsp; Just know it is something that I really wanted to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time my wife and I had five children. I remember someone asking me, &ldquo;What is going to happen to your wife and kids if something happens to you or you have long-term medical issues as a result of donating kidney?&rdquo; I had honestly never thought about that question, but it caused me to ponder the decision even more deeply. I remember feeling I needed to take this decision to the Lord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June 1, 2010, I took a vacation day from work and went to the Rexburg Idaho Temple. I was taking this issue to the Lord, seeking instruction to determine if I should donate my kidney to my brother. I remember after a wonderful session walking into the Celestial Room in the Rexburg Temple. I sat down and began praying and seeking direction. I glanced over at the table next to me and noticed a set of scriptures on it. A feeling came to open the Bible, but I thought to myself &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here to read. I am seeking answers from the Lord.&rdquo; Again the thought came, &ldquo;Open the Bible.&rdquo; Again, I told myself I didn&rsquo;t come here to read but to seek direction. Finally, as if the Lord was to speaking to me, I remember thinking, &ldquo;I know. Open the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After going through this mental exercise, I realized the Lord was trying to tell me His advice through the scriptures. So I opened the Bible not knowing where to go and found myself in Proverbs 16. Verse 9 jumped out from the pages and into my soul: &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s heart deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his steps&rdquo; (Proverbs 16:9).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that this message was sent directly from the Lord. Remember: donating my kidney was something I wanted to do. In my heart of hearts, I wanted to do it. However, the message to me was that even though my heart was behind this, the Lord was directing my steps and all of this was not a coincidence. I got the prompting that He had created my brother&rsquo;s body, and He had created my body. He knew that one day I would need to give a kidney to my brother and created both of our bodies for the transplant to occur. In my opinion, that is why we were such a good match. I was created to be a good match; it was part of the Lord&rsquo;s plan for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 13, 2010, a very successful transplant occurred. It was a life-changing experience. I received deep lessons about the Savior, the Atonement, and His sacrifice that I could not have received any other way. It was something I needed and in the end I was the recipient of great blessings.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about the big plan&mdash;the Plan of Salvation. In Abraham 3 we read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first&rdquo; (Abraham 3:22, 26-27).</p>
<p>Within this scripture there is a reference to our pre-mortal existence where two plans were presented: 1) Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan and 2) Lucifer&rsquo;s plan. One plan involved agency; the other plan did not. The plan that did not involve agency guaranteed that all of Heavenly Father&rsquo;s children would return to Him. The plan that did involve agency required a Savior. This requirement is a key difference between the two plans. Heavenly Father knew we wouldn&rsquo;t conquer mortality and be perfect here. He knew we would need a Savior, and the person who represented Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan was the Savior Himself, Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does knowing about the plan bring hope? There are three reasons I would like to share. First, we chose the plan that included a messy mortality. We did not choose the efficient, mainstreamed, and guaranteed plan of salvation. We wanted&mdash;we chose&mdash;the experience we are having now. So when times get tough and challenging, we can have hope through the knowledge that we chose this mortality and by remembering the bigger picture of who we really are. We remember there is so much more to us and our existence than this mortal experience we are now traversing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, and the main reason why the Plan of Salvation brings hope, is that we have a Savior, Jesus Christ. We can rely on His grace instead of our own. We can have faith in the knowledge that His Grace is big enough for all of our challenges here on earth. We can know of his absolute love for us&mdash;perfect and unconditional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, we must remember that we are agents. In Doctrine and Covenants 58:27-28, we learn that we should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do things of our own free will. We also learn that the power is in us to be agents and as long as we do good, we will not lose our reward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why won&rsquo;t we lose our reward? Because we have a Savior to help us. In fact, agency is made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Knowing who we truly are goes hand-in-hand with the plan we chose in the pre-mortal life and helps us live up to our birthright. There is great power when we know who we are and that we are children of God and also agents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to offer a suggestion to help us through mortality. &ldquo;Be where you are supposed to be, when you are supposed to be there.&rdquo; This is such good advice. I remember Sister Sue Clark talking about this during a devotional here at BYU-Idaho. It also relates to the plan the Lord has for us because being where you are supposed to be and doing what you are supposed to be doing is another phrase for following the Lord&rsquo;s plan. There is safety in this. By doing this we will be able to enter into and keep eternal covenants. If we truly know who we are, these covenants are inseparable from the plan we chose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story of David in the Old Testament demonstrates this principle. David was a valiant servant of the Lord who had complete faith. He slew the giant and enraged the king with jealousy. Many times David proved himself as a dedicated servant of the Lord. I am sure most of us know that he ended up being king after Saul; the same king enraged by jealousy toward David. But then we read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel&hellip;But David tarried still at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king&rsquo;s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon&rdquo; (2 Samuel 11:1-2).</p>
<p>Most of us know the rest of the story. Bath-sheba conceived, and a great cover-up began to unfold. David continued to try to get Uriah (Bath-sheba&rsquo;s husband) to go to his own home. However, Uriah refused instead wanting to fulfill his duties, wanting to be where he was suppose to be. Eventually, David ordered Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle and Uriah ended up being killed in that battle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How might this story be different if David was where he was supposed to be? If David had been with his armies and all Israel at the time when kings go forth to battle, instead of still tarrying at Jerusalem, he would never have strolled on his roof that night in Jerusalem. He would not have been in the position of temptation that was the first step of this tragic story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is safety and protection in being where you are supposed to be when you are supposed to be there. This advice will help us avoid situations of temptation and allow the Lord to use us as tools to do His work. We will be where He needs us to be. We must choose for ourselves and exercise our agency to follow this advice. Make an effort and be an agent. Be where you are supposed to be and do what you are supposed to be doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The difficult part is when it is not apparent where we are supposed to be or what we are supposed to be doing. There are many times in our lives when we have a number of good things, duties, and responsibilities that all compete for our time. It may seem that we cannot do all that is required with the good in life that really matters. This may include family, church, school, work responsibilities, and many others. Important things that have a demand on us, things we need to get done. In fact, we may feel guilty because we can&rsquo;t do it all. What do we do in this situation when we are motivated by doing what is right? Because we are children of God, He expects us to come to Him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul&rdquo; (2 Nephi 32:8-9).</p>
<p>What a beautiful invitation for us to pray. That is the key: relying on the Lord. The Lord knows what we should be doing. In the end, all of us will stand accountable to Him as to whether or not we did what we should have done during this life. If we are unsure what we should focus our efforts on, He will tell us. He will let us know where we should be and what we should be doing when life gets crazy and hectic. Once we receive that personal revelation and act, we can leave the guilt behind. We can know we are doing what the Lord would have us do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have great faith in what it means to be a child of God. It is important for us to understand what that means from a deep level. We need that deep level of understanding so we won&rsquo;t sell our birthright for a mess of pottage. Knowing who we are helps us understand our birthright. Understanding our divine heritage includes so much more than only knowing the Bible has 66 books. That perspective is a very surface-level understanding. There is so much more to know and understand about the Bible than simply the number of books it has. If that is all we know, we miss so much of what is in that volume of scripture. Likewise, there is so much more to all of us and so much we can miss within ourselves if we don&rsquo;t know <em>deep down</em> what it means to be a son or daughter of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we understand who we are and our journey through mortality, we must see everyone else as who <em>they</em> truly are. We must see each other as children of God. We are all fallen individuals with a divine heritage making our way through a mortal existence that we chose. We are all dependent on the Savior and owe everything we have to Him. This makes us all candidates for the celestial kingdom. Because we know this, we have a responsibility to treat each other with love and kindness. The last thing we want is for people to unfairly judge us or impose unrealistic mortal expectations upon us. We shouldn&rsquo;t do that to ourselves or to others. With love and respect, we must help others enter into and keep eternal covenants. We must help bring people closer to Jesus Christ. Instead of harshly judging ourselves and others, we must evaluate our actions and measure them to see if we are bringing ourselves and others closer or farther away from the Savior. By bringing people closer to the Savior, we will find that we too will become closer to Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When all is said and done, I can&rsquo;t make you understand who you really are. That is an exercise you will have to go through in order for you to own that knowledge for yourself. I invite all of you to ponder who you really are and then go to the Lord. Ask in prayer to find out. Ask if you are His child. I know your prayers will be answered. I also know that Heavenly Father, in his loving and individual way, will tell you who you are and you will begin to feel the glory that is in you. You won&rsquo;t feel lost in this mortal existence. In fact, you will feel deep joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to express my thanks and gratitude to Jesus Christ. I know that He is my Savior. Because of Him, all is not lost. We can have hope, we can be cheerful, and we can have complete faith in the plan He presented, which is the same plan we chose. We can know that if we forget who we are, there is a process for us to remember. A process that, with open arms, He welcomes and invites us to enter: the process of repentance. A process that at one time or another we must all go through. A process that makes us clean; one that is essential for us to reach Heavenly Father&rsquo;s standard of perfection. We cannot do it by ourselves. A Savior is needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also grateful for a loving Heavenly Father. I know that I am His son. I know that He is real and lives. I know that I have a divine heritage and destiny. I know that there is glory in me that cannot be compared to the challenges I face. That glory exists in all of us because we are His Children. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>What a privilege it is to attend a Church-sponsored school. Here we study and learn with those of like values and similar interests. You can trust that your teachers are doing everything in their power to be sure the knowledge they pass on to you is in full accordance with the truth. In that sense, everything you are learning is comprised in the gospel of Jesus Christ, which encompasses all truth. In the early days of the Restoration, before Church universities or other formal institutions of learning were ever dreamed of, there was the School of the Prophets. The first such school was established in January 1833 in Kirtland, Ohio. The revelation that contained the Lord&rsquo;s injunction for establishing of the School the Prophets, is found in Doctrine and Covenants 88:77-78: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom. Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is the mandate that governs this great university. We must teach one another. We must be diligent in that effort&ndash;&ndash;that we might learn more perfectly the principles that are expedient for us to understand. In another revelation the Lord indicated to the Prophet Joseph that Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the Law of the Celestial Kingdom (see D&amp;C 105:5).&nbsp; Later, as recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 130, the Lord inspired the Prophet Joseph to say, &ldquo;Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This life is about learning principles. Principles are the fundamental truths that make up our system of belief and behavior. They do not change with the winds of social convention or personal style. As Thomas Jefferson said, &ldquo;In matters of principle, [we must] stand like a rock.&rdquo; The principles we learn are the bricks out of which we will build the mansion that will be our eternal home. Only celestial bricks, firm and true, can be used to build a home that will stand in a heavenly neighborhood. And the more we learn, the more bricks we accumulate, the greater our advantage in the world to come (D&amp;C 130:19). True principles also serve as links in a chain of reasoning that will allow us to exercise wisdom and good judgment. In fact, these two essential virtues&mdash;wisdom and judgment&mdash;are derived from a sound understanding of fundamental principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we go through life things happen to us, we gain experience and we are educated. Sometimes the most difficult and challenging learning experiences teach us the most. Remember what the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph at his low point, &ldquo;All these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good&rdquo; (D&amp;C 122:7). As we learn and understand the principles that are associated with our experience we develop knowledge, but that knowledge is worse than useless unless we actively apply it according to &ldquo;the counsels of God&rdquo; (2 Nephi 9:29). Wisdom is the capacity to make sound application of knowledge that is based on true principles. With practice and additional life experience, we gain in wisdom and develop good judgment. Good judgment is the ability to make choices that maximize the possibility of the most positive outcome. So, understanding true principles brings wisdom which allows for the exercise of good judgment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we derive from the experiences of life the fundamental and true principles on which our belief and behavior should be based and which will result in the wisdom and good judgment we seek? The answer is really quite simple. We pay attention. Let me give you a few examples. First, an experience from my childhood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is there about a tree that makes a young person crave to climb it? I guess even we older people want to climb, but the yearning is rarely powerful enough to get us up into the branches. All I can remember about the last time I climbed a tree is how long it took to get the sap off of my hands. Children don&rsquo;t worry about sap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was a boy, we lived near a large tract of trees, including evergreens in various stages of development. One of our climbing games required two boys to a tree. For this we sought out springy young pine trees. We chose each tree with great care. It had to be not too big and not too small, with just the right amount of spring. The first boy up the tree went as high as he could with the other boy following. As the second came close to the top, their combined weight would cause the tree to bend slowly downward, bending farther and farther, until the upper trunk had dipped its occupants down to a safe distance from the ground. Their four feet dangling a short way above Mother Earth, the boys prepared to drop from the tree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With synchronicity usually reserved for a far more sophisticated setting, the two boys, acting as one, released their grip on the sappy limbs. The well-torqued trunk sprang like an unloaded catapult back to upright dignity. The boys dropped to the ground with hardly a thud, their reward the cheers of admiring peers, each of whom judged the feat a 10. What fun we had! Find another perfect tree and go for it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one particularly exciting bout, the smallest of our crew started up a young pine. He had to be matched with the heaviest boy in order to create a combined weight adequate to bend the tree. Sure enough, they moved toward the top and the tree bowed to their wishes. All was going well. The tree lowered to a proper height, hands let go, and the tree sprang up. But this time only two feet hit the ground. The heavy boy had let go before the light one was ready. Our little buddy nearly cracked like a whip as he shot up with the treetop. The snap of the tree shook him loose, and down he tumbled through the branches. The result was two broken arms and a stern parental lecture, and our tandem tree climbing had to be put on hold for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, what did we learn from that? The older we get, the more obvious it is to us that we should stay out of trees. A person can get hurt! But we sure do a lot of other things without thinking too much about the consequences. We may not be scaling pines, but we introduce plenty of risk into our lives. We drive too fast; we go too far into debt; we eat too much junk food; we take on too much stress. Most of us, in one way or another, are way out on a limb, never figuring that something will go wrong. None of us young tree climbers ever thought about the possibility of broken arms, either. Our friend learned the lesson the hard way. So, the principle: Never climb higher than you&rsquo;re willing to fall. Applying this principle will give you wisdom and good judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another learning experience took place for me at the dedication of the Preston England Temple which I attended in President Gordon B. Hinckley&rsquo;s traveling party. Wherever President Hinckley went there were plenty of kind and helpful volunteer security people to make sure he was taken care of. This was no exception. One particular security guard caught my attention. His name was Leslie. He looked a little pitiful sitting by himself at the end of a long corridor. He was a rather small Englishman with thin and graying hair, not the kind to make one feel especially secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, Leslie was guarding a locked door at the end of a little-used hallway. Why, I cannot say. No barehanded human could get through the heavy, bolted door. Whatever could break it down, should someone for some unknown reason want to break it down, would not be deterred by diminutive Leslie. The main threat from this direction was not likely to be from any outside source of danger, but from the almost deadly boredom that filled the air at the end of the hall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sorry for this poor man. I introduced myself, hoping a moment of conversation might ease the monotony some.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your name?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie,&rdquo; he said quietly, perhaps a little annoyed at my intrusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are you from, Leslie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liverpool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I quipped, &ldquo;Leslie of Liverpool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He grinned a bit sheepishly and probably thought I was making fun of him. Leslie was very pleasant, though, and quickly my impression of him changed. Here was a bright, dignified, middle-aged man. He wasn&rsquo;t a big man, but not quite as small as I had first thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I soon learned that Leslie worked as a security guard in another city, in Liverpool actually, but this post he manned as a volunteer for the temple dedication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;could I get you a softer chair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this one will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I proposed, &ldquo;do you really need to be here? Nothing seems likely to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He looked around as if to quickly assess the current level of security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just do what I&rsquo;ve been asked,&rdquo; he said in his thick Liverpudlian accent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just do me duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I at least bring you a can of juice or something? You could man your post and still drink some juice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; he replied with a certain firmness in his voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just do me duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally gave up. &ldquo;Okay, have a good evening.&rdquo; I admit I was not very sympathetic to Leslie&rsquo;s sense of duty. It seemed a bit overzealous to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night I had an interesting dream. We were in England, so it is not surprising that it was a dream of knights and heavy armor and white horses. There were brave battle scenes with fighting hordes and clanging swords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One knight stood out among all the rest. I don&rsquo;t remember if his armor was actually shining, but he was strong and true and the hero of my dream. As the hero-knight emerged victorious, he stopped and dismounted his powerful steed. He stood before me, removed his helmet with dignity, and quietly introduced himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, sir,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;I am Leslie, Leslie of Liverpool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I awoke with a start. Wide awake. And I saw clearly the courage of Leslie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had been asked to perform a rather perfunctory task, but his sense of honor and duty caused him to do it to the very best of his ability. I think he would have guarded the Royal Jewels with no more pride or careful attention. Even as a volunteer, not being paid at all and sitting alone in that empty hall, he felt a commitment to muster all his professional skill and to focus on the performance of his duty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leslie taught me the principle that to do your duty is to set aside self and give heart and mind to the higher good. To give it your all, even when the individual task seems truly menial, that is the fulfillment of duty. The next evening as I was leaving the building I looked in hope for Leslie. He was there again, at the end of the hall, a knight in invisible armor doing his duty. I was glad to see him. We greeted each other. I didn&rsquo;t tell him why, but I asked a passerby to take my picture standing next to Leslie. I wanted to remember what a hero looks like and to prove that I had known one. The principle: I&rsquo;ll just do me duty. Leslie had learned this and was therefore able to wisely exercise good judgment in fulfilling his responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord desires that we govern ourselves &ldquo;according to just and holy principles&rdquo; (D&amp;C 101:77). There is an interesting correlation between these principles and our ability to fully exercise our moral agency. True principles are provided &ldquo;that every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment&rdquo; (D&amp;C 101:78). It seems that an understanding of true principles increases our intelligence and expands our agency, or gives us greater power to act according to the moral agency which the Lord has given us. There is some risk in increasing our knowledge, for &ldquo;where much is given much is required&rdquo; (D&amp;C 82:3). The more we learn, the more accountable we become for our actions. As our knowledge increases, the Lord expects us to be more reasonable and more wise, to exercise better judgment, and to act in truth upon the knowledge we have gained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from the risks involved, we can derive great benefit from the knowledge of true principles. The more we learn, the more likely we are to live a prosperous and faithful life. We know that we are saved no faster than we gain intelligence. &ldquo;And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come&rdquo; (D&amp;C 130:19). Indeed, &ldquo;It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance&rdquo; (D&amp;C 131:6).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned, this learning process is not always pleasant. I have learned by sad experience, and I suppose that you have also, that &ldquo;wickedness never was happiness&rdquo; (Alma 41:10). Though never inclined to serious sin, I have committed my share of youthful indiscretions. Though a few may have brought a little momentary excitement, happiness was never the result. From these experiences we learn the principles that govern the society in which we live, be it community or family. We also learn to exercise greater wisdom and better judgment in future choices, or, as the scriptures say, matters &ldquo;pertaining to futurity.&rdquo; At this point I could share some hair raising stories of childhood adventures, but wisdom dictates that grandpa give no big ideas to his grandchildren who may one day hear this message&mdash;especially ideas that he can&rsquo;t defend by saying, &ldquo;I would never dream of doing such a thing.&rdquo; So, on to the next principle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s speak for a moment about what might be called the principle of two voices. In some of his most poignant instruction to his son Jacob, the Prophet Lehi taught the wonderful principle that &ldquo;men are that they might have joy&rdquo; (2 Nephi 2:25). He taught that in order to achieve this joy, we must listen to and follow the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. By consistently following the voice of the Spirit we choose eternal life. There is, of course, an alternative. If we follow the will of the flesh and listen to the voice of the natural man, then by and by we have chosen eternal death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see then that there are two voices to which we may choose to listen: the voice of the Holy Spirit and the voice of the natural man. Our natural inclination is to listen to the voice of the natural man and &ldquo;the evil which is therein&rdquo; (2 Nephi 2:29). We are literally hard-wired to respond to the demands of our flesh and to give in to bodily beckoning which can lead to sin. When we do that, we give power to the devil, and he uses his influence to captivate us and to bring us down to hell, that he may reign over us in his own kingdom. But he has no power if we choose to ignore the voice of the natural man and pattern our behavior after the whisperings of the Holy Ghost, which always invite and entice to do good. This principle is born out in a statement that was made to describe Moroni. Of him it was said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea,the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The devil only has power over us as we yield to the tempting voice of the natural man. It is so much easier to make daily choices when we understand that we only have to differentiate between two voices&mdash;the voice of the Holy Ghost and the voice of the natural man. Satan doesn&rsquo;t enter into the equation until we yield to the natural man who, &ldquo;is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Mosiah 3:19).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we learn and understand this principle of two voices, our behavior will improve and we will become better and better at following the voice of the Spirit. By the grace of a loving Heavenly Father and the Atonement wrought by his Holy Son, we are given ample time to learn to apply this principle in our life. Right after describing Moroni as one who had learned to listen to the voice of the Spirit, the Book of Mormon writer says, &ldquo;Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea, and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God&rdquo; (Alma 48:18).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Ammon and the other sons of Mosiah and Alma the Younger are all equated with Moroni as men of God. You know from your study of the Book of Mormon that they did not start out that way. So if there is hope for them to learn to listen to the will of the Holy Spirit, there is hope for us. The more we listen to the voice of the Spirit the less we will be inclined to give in to our natural inclinations and the less we will feel of the influence of the adversary. It&rsquo;s easy to see how the application of this important principle will bring greater wisdom and better judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore one last principle. We live in a world that glorifies idols and champions. We appreciate those who are striving to be stronger, higher, and faster. But the strongest girl I ever saw was actually pretty frail and would have been no match in an athletic contest. No one would covet her young life, which was full of fear, confusion, and a deep self-loathing. It was during this time that she was being abused by her stepfather.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Millie was physically and sexually abused by her mother&rsquo;s second husband. He was not a nice guy, but we will leave his punishment to the powers that be. Millie wasn&rsquo;t interested in punishing anybody. She knew what pain is like and didn&rsquo;t want to be involved in giving or receiving any more of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I met Millie, she was a young woman trying to understand what she had done to deserve such treatment. In her confused and painful thinking, she was certain that he wouldn&rsquo;t have done it without some provocation or enticement. He had told her that it was her fault. And grown-ups are always right, aren&rsquo;t they?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Millie was strong even with that misplaced sense of responsibility for her traumatic circumstances. She was trying to fight her way out. She was trying to figure out how to live with the memory of the abuse and not be consumed by it. For some time, the best she was able to do was to label herself a victim. This was an important first step, realizing that she had been victimized and that it wasn&rsquo;t her fault, but for Millie it wasn&rsquo;t enough. She wanted freedom from the on-going victimization of the terrible experience. She wanted to somehow let go of it completely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day Millie was stunned by a thought-provoking passage from Victor Hugo&rsquo;s <em>Les Miserables</em>. It reads, &ldquo;The soul helps the body and at certain moments uplifts it.&nbsp; It is the only bird that sustains its cage.&rdquo; This came as a revelation to Millie. She could see that her body is sort of like a cage that surrounds the real Millie. If that is so, she wondered, then could it be that he was hurting the cage, but that the bird was not damaged at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course! He could beat the cage, he could abuse the cage, he could even break the cage, but he couldn&rsquo;t get at the beautiful bird inside. Even if he destroyed the cage, the bird would just fly free beyond his ability to afflict any more harm. He might frighten the little bird out of singing for a while, but he could not take away her song forever. With this insight Millie was liberated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Millie stopped calling herself a victim. She ceased defining herself by what he had done to her. The abuse is something that happened to her it is not her. Millie is one of the strongest people I have ever met. The principle: Bad things may happen to me, but they are not me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emerson said, &ldquo;The value of a principle is the number of things it will explain.&rdquo; The principles learned by Millie explain a great deal. When we know that we have a dual nature&mdash;spirit and body&mdash;we better understand our relationship with God and the purpose of our existence on the earth. When we know that we need not define ourselves by the hard things that happen to us, then we can move forward in life with greater joy and less sense of entrapment by the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we have covered only four of an endless number of principles that life can teach us if we pay attention. By way of review, never climb higher than you are willing to fall, just do your duty, learn to listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit, and don&rsquo;t define yourself by the bad things that may happen to you. By applying these and other essential principles, you will have a life that is cushioned by wisdom, guided by good judgment, and full of joy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am very humbled and honored by this invitation to come and speak with you today on this beautiful campus. This is the first time in my life I have ever been here. I can&rsquo;t believe it. I should have come here years earlier. This is a wonderful place and you are very blessed to be students here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife and I had the opportunity to go to the temple this morning&ndash;&ndash;this beautiful Rexburg Temple. How blessed you are to have this beautiful temple right next to your campus. I promise you, brothers and sisters, that if you go to the House of the Lord, right here where you&rsquo;re living and going to school, that the power of God will come into your lives and you will have the Spirit of the Lord. Go to the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was reminded that when my wife and I were newlyweds 38 &frac12; years ago and we were students at Arizona State University, our very first apartment was right across the street from the Mesa Arizona Temple. And that blessed our lives. We attended that temple. We did some ordinance work in that temple and it is such a sacred place for us. Make this Rexburg Temple a sacred place for you.</p>
<p>In the 50th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we read these words: &ldquo;Wherefore, I the Lord, ask ye this question, unto what were ye ordained? To preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the Comforter, which was sent forth to taste the truth. And if it be by some other way, it is not of God. Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth understand one another and both are edified and rejoice together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray that I will be able to speak by the Spirit, and that you will listen by the Spirit so that we will be edified and we can rejoice together. Today, I desire to speak on our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I am grateful for the music which we have heard, and which we have sung, that has set the tone for this grand topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi, in the Book of Mormon, says that &ldquo;we preach of Christ; we rejoice in Christ; we talk of Christ; and we prophecy of Christ.&rdquo; That is what I desire to do today with you&ndash;&ndash;to testify of Christ. As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we are truly blessed. We are blessed to have more information about the Savior, Jesus Christ, than even our brothers and sisters of other faiths. Why? Because not only do we have the Holy Bible which they have, but in addition, we have the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the words of living apostles and prophets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that Jesus Christ is the firstborn of all the spirit children of God. In the pre-existence we were all born of celestial parentage. But the firstborn was Jesus Christ. He announced that and He identified Himself as the first born in several scriptures. He is, therefore, our older brother. He is also the almighty Jehovah. To Abraham and Moses and Isaiah and many of the prophets, He identified Himself as the God of Israel and Jehovah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When He appeared to Oliver Cowdry and Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple, He identified Himself as Jehovah. Let there be no mistake about it. Let there not be any misunderstanding. Christ is Jehovah. When our Father in Heaven offered the great plan of salvation in the pre-existence, it was Jehovah who conformed and accepted the plan. He was foreordained from the foundation to be the lamb to be slain, to put that plan of salvation into effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus, or Jehovah, was greater than us all, and the Father honored Him by calling the plan of salvation the gospel of Jesus Christ. The gospel of Jesus Christ, or the doctrine of Jesus Christ, is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins by proper authority, the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end in righteousness all of our days in mortality. It embraces the creation and the fall of Adam and the atonement of Jesus Christ. It contains all the principles and laws and ordinances that enable us to return to the presence of God. It is the glad tidings of great joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus is the Creator. Under the Father, He was instructed and allowed and authorized to create this world and to create many worlds. And so, He is the Creator. He is the Lord God Omnipotent. He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He is the great &ldquo;I Am.&rdquo; He is the Messiah, and He is the anointed One. We knew all of this before He ever came into mortality. Now when He was born into mortality, we know of what a miraculous birth it was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus is the only begotten Son of the Father in the flesh. His father literally was our Father in Heaven, Elohim, and from His Father in Heaven He inherited immortality or the ability to live forever. His mother was the blessed virgin Mary, a mortal, and from her He inherited mortality, or the ability to die. Thus He is different from the rest of us because His mother was mortal and His father was immortal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the words in the Book of Mormon that talk about this, where Nephi received a great vision. This is what he said: &ldquo;He said unto me, behold the Virgin whom thou seest as the Mother of the Son of God after the manner of the flesh. And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit. And after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time, the angels spake unto me saying, &lsquo;look,&rsquo; and I looked and beheld the Virgin again bearing a child in her arms. And the angels said unto me, &lsquo;behold, the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a wonderful truth this is. Although the Almighty Jehovah who created this earth and was so powerful and mighty, He humbly came to this earth and was born in a lowly stable among the beasts of the field. Basically the world was unaware of His coming. There were some faithful saints that knew. There were some faithful shepherds that knew. They heard the angel that announced it. They heard the praises in the heavens that Christ had been born. But it was basically a lowly birth when He came in the meridian of time.</p>
<p>Now, how do we know so much about the Savior? There&rsquo;s a wonderful scripture in John that says: &ldquo;Search the scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testifies of me.&rdquo; It is in the scriptures that we learn about Christ, and it is by the power of the Holy Ghost that we learn about Christ&ndash;&ndash;through revelation and through the promptings of the Spirit. It is because we have living apostles and prophets today who teach us about Christ that we know so much about Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that when he was a 12-year-old boy, He was found in the temple teaching His Father&rsquo;s doctrine and confounding the worldly wise. When Joseph and Mary found Him, He said, &ldquo;Wist ye not that I be about my Father&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that He grew in grace and mercy and power and stature. When He was about 30 years old, He went to His second cousin, John the Baptist, and was baptized in the Jordan River. What a glorious occasion that was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He demonstrated His humility and His obedience to the Father in all things and after He came forth out of the water, the Holy Ghost descended in a personage like a dove, and the voice of God the Father was heard and said, &ldquo;This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After He was baptized we read that He was tempted of Satan, but He was the sinless one. He never gave in to temptation and He overcame the devil. We read about the miracles that He did to demonstrate who He really was and to minister among man. We read about the healings, about how He healed the blind to see, and the deaf to hear, and the lame to walk. He even healed the lepers of their awful disease. He cast out devils by those who were so possessed. Truly our Lord made men whole physically and spiritually. He controlled the elements of nature. He walked on water. He calmed the storm. He turned water into wine. He fed thousands with just a few loaves of bread and a few fish. He organized His church. He instituted the ordinance of the sacrament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For 4,000 years the saints had been looking forward to a great sacrifice that was going to occur. And then the Lord, right at this time before He gave His own life, instituted the ordinance of the sacrament. No longer would the saints look forward to this great sacrifice because He was going to perform the sacrifice. And from that point on, we, the saints of God, were going to remember the sacrifice. Of course, the great reason for His first coming in the meridian of time was to perform the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith received a wonderful vision, the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. We love that section. The early saints just called it &ldquo;the vision.&rdquo; It is so full of pure true doctrine. We read these verses: &ldquo;And this is the gospel, the glad tidings which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us. That He came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness, that through Him all might be saved whom the Father had put into His power and made by Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that beautiful? I love the Prophet Joseph and I love him for his testimony of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. There&rsquo;s another passage that I think we should read together in 3 Nephi, for the Savior bears witness of Himself. In the 27th chapter beginning with verse 13: &ldquo;Behold, I have given unto you my gospel; and this is the gospel which I have given unto you. That I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me. And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross, and after I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me; as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before Him, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many scriptures that we could read about the atonement. The Prophet Joseph, in section 19 of the Doctrine and Covenants, received a great revelation. The agony and the grief were so severe during that atoning sacrifice that Christ bled from every pore. We could go on. The great discourse that King Benjamin gave where the angel taught him about the Savior and the atoning sacrifice.</p>
<p>Jesus is our Savior and He is our Redeemer. He has saved us from the fall of Adam; He has saved us from death, both physical and spiritual deaths. He is our Redeemer. I love the words of the Apostle Paul&ndash;&ndash;he says it so eloquently: &ldquo;For as Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christ is the first fruits of them that slept. He is the resurrected and risen Lord, and salvation is in Him and Him only. There is no other way nor name nor means by which we can be saved other than through Jesus Christ. He is the Great Exemplar. He Himself asked this question: &ldquo;Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be?&rdquo; Then He answered: &ldquo;Verily I say unto you, even as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God the Father manifests Himself to us through His beloved son, Jesus Christ. In John we read, &ldquo;I am the way, the truth and the light. He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.&rdquo; Then He goes on to say that the works that He did were the works of the Father and that the Father was in Him and He was in the Father. The Father and the Son are one. They are one in many ways. They are one in perfection. They are one in purpose. They are one in unity. They are one in appearance. They think, and say, and do the same things. They are one and we are to be one like them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Jesus&rsquo; ascension into heaven, the scriptures record other appearances that He made to men and women. But the one I would like to refer to is the appearance He made in the spring of 1820, to a boy-prophet, in New York. When God the Son and God the Father appeared to that boy and ushered in the great restoration of the gospel in these the latter days. They ushered in the great dispensation of the fullness of times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear you my witness, brothers and sisters that the first vision really happened. It is not a myth; it is not a fairy tale. It is not a fictional story. God, the Eternal Father, and His beloved son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the Prophet Joseph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We call it the First Vision because it was the first of many visitations and visions that the then-prophet was to receive. But I also think it was first in importance because the Father and the Son came together. Jesus Christ is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. We read in the scriptures that when He comes again His appearance will be so great and that there will be fire on earth and that the very mountains will melt and flow in the presence of His return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph, the scriptures say: &ldquo;The very sun will hide his face in shame. That the moon will withhold its light; and that the stars will be hurled from the heavens in the presence of the return of the second coming of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul says: &ldquo;Every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess that He is God&rsquo;s only Son.&rdquo; Well, what does this mean for us? What does this mean for you students here at BYU-Idaho in the year 2012?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I can illustrate from a story that happened to me. Forty-one years ago when I was in the LTM&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s how old I am, before the MTC&ndash;&ndash;I was learning Spanish to go to Spain on my mission. I was reading the intercessory prayer when Christ was praying to the Father, and I was reading it in Spanish. I should say I was trying to read it in Spanish, and I read this verse that&ndash;&ndash;well, let me read it. It&rsquo;s such a beautiful verse; I just don&rsquo;t want to make a mistake. &ldquo;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.&rdquo; When I read that, the Spirit came upon me. I had just learned the day before in Spanish class that in Spanish there are two different ways of using the verb &ldquo;to know&rdquo; for our English verb &ldquo;to know.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s <em>saber</em>, which means &ldquo;to know about something or to know something&rdquo; and there&rsquo;s the verb <em>conocer</em>, which means &ldquo;to be acquainted with or to know someone personally.&rdquo; When I read that scripture that this is life eternal, that we might <em>know thee, </em>the verb <em>concocer</em> was used. I realized it was not enough to know about God. Yes, it&rsquo;s important and that&rsquo;s what we try to do, but we need &ldquo;to know&rdquo; Him personally. We need to be acquainted with Him. It was a great revelatory experience for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the past 41 years I have tried to come to know my God and His beloved Son personally, to be acquainted with them. Because the scriptures say this is what we have to do to gain eternal life, and I think the reason is that when we get to know Them, the Father and the Son, we want to be like Them. We want to rise up from carnality and evil, and we want to be holy like They are holy. Once we come to know Them, then we become like the Apostle Paul when he said: &ldquo;For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. For it is the power of God unto salvation.&rdquo; And when we come to know Them, our faith is increased and we are like my late uncle, the apostle Bruce R. McConkie, who said, &ldquo;I believe in Christ, come what may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we get to know God and His Son by the power of the Holy Ghost on a personal level, then we are like Enoch and Elijah and Joseph Smith who knew Them in such a way that they will inherit eternal life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear you my witness brothers and sisters that Jesus is the Christ. He is all these things of which we have spoken. There&rsquo;s a scripture that says in Isaiah: &ldquo;Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord. That I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior. Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is our obligation, brothers and sisters: to be witnesses to Christ in word and deed. May we be courageous and open our mouths and be missionaries and bear our testimony of what we know about Jesus Christ our Lord. May we live lives of purity and cleanliness. May we repent of our sins and keep the commandments and be true and faithful to our sacred covenants, so that we are living witnesses of Christ by our very existence; that our lives, our sermons are of Christ. That&rsquo;s what we need to do with the knowledge that we have&ndash;&ndash;this precious knowledge, the testimony we have of Christ. Let&rsquo;s be like Him. Let&rsquo;s be living witnesses of Him, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>We began today by singing one of my favorite hymns: &ldquo;The Light Divine.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&ldquo;The Light of God rests on the face of brook and flower and tree.&rdquo; You'll notice that these are all beautiful things. Beauty is one of the surest signs in this world that God lives and loves us. When we see the sun rise, or hear a bird sing, or smell a flower, or listen to the low ceaseless roar of the ocean, it kindles hope in our hearts. It makes us happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beauty is the presence of God&rsquo;s power in all things. It is a truth that shines; it is the power of life; it is a principle of order, of structure, of form and balance. Most of all, it is love. When we see or hear or touch or smell or taste a beautiful object, we feel our Creator&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beautiful things of this world call to us. They are placed here to remind us of our true home. A loving God bore us as his spiritual offspring, and he will never forsake us. He wants us to return one day and live with Him. We have a divine nature and an eternal destiny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Irish poet John O&rsquo;Donohue tells us that &ldquo;beauty is the secret sound of the deepest thereness of things.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;What he means by &ldquo;thereness&rdquo; is their eternal nature and their source in the love and creativity of God. They have always been there, and always will. Mortality gives a disturbing illusion of the temporariness of things. Everywhere we look, things seem to unravel, to proceed from order to disorder. Scientists call this the principle of entropy. But behind all the apparent entropy are things that are and always will be there. When we see the beauty of something, we perceive its eternal and changeless nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Book of Moses tells us that all things were created spiritually before they were temporally.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;All things have a plan that is as eternal as their being. Life is striving to become the plan. Only when a creature becomes its plan does it fill the measure of its creation. Essential to the process of becoming is the process of knowing. We need to know God, we need to know ourselves, and we need to come to understand the plan God has for us. God teaches us in many ways: through the instruction of the Spirit, through the teaching of prophets and other teachers, through scriptures and great books, through the examples of others, even through the incomparable and surprising wonders of the natural world. God has also inspired artists and musicians and poets to create great works of art that are embedded with truth. They can teach us many things about the plan God has for us if we will only look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of semesters ago I had a student in one of my classes who was from Minnesota. She told our class that she was glad she came to Idaho, even though it was so ugly. I expect that she said this because Idaho is not as lush and green as Minnesota. I was a little offended, and recommended that she take the short drive to Mesa Falls or Harriman State Park or the Tetons. But then I remembered that I had a similar experience in my younger years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my first teaching job, I took my young family to Las Cruces, New Mexico. It was very different from Idaho. Instead of lawns, most people had gravel. Instead of wood and brick, the houses were made of adobe and stucco. Instead of grass and trees, there was sand and creosote. They had things that they called rivers, but there was no water in them. They had mountains, but they weren&rsquo;t covered with trees; instead they appeared to be nothing but dirt and rock. Everything seemed to poke you, pinch you, bite you, or sting you. I looked about me and decided that it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before we moved away and went somewhere more attractive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as it turned out, we stayed for 17 years. We raised our children there, built an opera company, served in the Church, and came to love the people of the Mesilla Valley. We built a house in the desert and got to know its myriad plant and animal life: the cactuses, the mesquite, the jameston weed, the jackrabbits, the lizards, even the snakes and tarantulas. We camped and hiked with our children in the mountains. My wife built Christmas wreaths out of pods from yucca plants. We first endured, then tolerated, then embraced the hot green chili that grew in the fields along the Rio Grande. We discovered that there were toads in the desert that slept in the sand for 11 months of the year, but when the summer monsoons came they would come out of their torpor and hop all over the streets, yards, and sidewalks, and lay eggs in the short-lived pools of standing water. In a few days the puddles were filled with polliwogs, then in a few more they would change into toads and burrow into the sand again. We also discovered that every three or four springs, when the winter had been just right, millions of orange Mexican poppies would blanket the valleys and mountainsides. Nearly every evening&mdash;spring, summer, fall, and winter&mdash;we were treated to a magnificent sunset. And the weather! As former Idahoans, we especially enjoyed our annual New Years&rsquo; Day picnic. We came to love New Mexico. Just like Idaho and Michigan, we found it to be beautiful. We just needed to get to know it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All too often we overlook beautiful things. Sometimes in our mortal lives we feel alone, trapped inside our own heads, beset by the &ldquo;thick of thin things.&rdquo; It is important to cultivate a habit of seeing and contemplating beauty in things. In times of trial this habit of beauty will strengthen us and teach us what we need to know. The philosopher Blaise Pascal said, &ldquo;In difficult times you should always carry something beautiful in your mind.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;It is not likely that we will begin to pursue beauty in the midst of our dark times. But if we have made its pursuit a habit now, when the dark times come it will be like a true and loyal friend who never leaves our side in the midst of our affliction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I would like to suggest five places that you can find beauty while you are here at BYU-Idaho. I invite you to arouse your faculties of perception and look for it. First, I invite you to look for beauty in the world around us. We are surrounded by beautiful things, if we only have eyes to see them. Every morning there is a sunrise, and every evening a sunset. There are flowers in the gardens in spring, fields of abundance in summer, a riot of colors in autumn, and pure white snow and the world at rest in winter. We can surround ourselves with beauty&mdash;not just great paintings and mighty symphonies (although those are good too), but simpler, easier things, like a snapshot of a friend, a well-set table, a clean room, or a well-edited homework assignment. There is joy in that kind of order, and the love of God, which is desirable above all other things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, the Lord has told us that the entire earth is here to make us happy. In Doctrine and Covenants 59, after talking about living the commandments, keeping the Sabbath, and fasting and prayer, the Lord tells us:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances&hellip;the fulness of the earth is yours, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which climbeth upon the trees and walketh upon the earth; Yea, and the herb, and the good things which come of the earth, whether for food or for raiment, or for houses, or for barns, or for orchards, or for gardens, or for vineyards; Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart; Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The abundance of the earth is ours to enjoy. There are only two conditions the Lord sets: &ldquo;And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Confessing God&rsquo;s hand means giving Him the credit. But it also means being grateful. To be grateful we must notice all that God has done for us, ponder it, and let it sink down deep into our hearts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, I invite you to see the beauty in the people you encounter while here at BYU-Idaho. This truly is a remarkable gathering place, and everyone who comes here has a story to tell about why they are here. Everyone has gifts that they either brought with them from the preexistence or have worked hard to develop while here on earth. In most cases, it is some of both. These gifts help each person accomplish the tasks that they are set to do in this life. Paul talks about spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians 12, and compares each of us, with our own spiritual gifts, to eyes and ears, hands and feet of a single body.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;He tells us to covet earnestly the best gifts.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But the greatest gift, he says, is charity.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without charity we live our lives in our own little worlds, neither giving anyone else the benefits of our gifts or receiving any benefit from theirs. I believe charity is at the heart of President Clark&rsquo;s counsel to remove from our faces the mask of indifference. I have so enjoyed the smiling faces I have seen since his devotional talk earlier this semester. This is true beauty. When I see you smile, I see your true nature and it makes me happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure your teachers also appreciate it when you bring your most precious gifts to their class, listen attentively to them when they talk to you, and participate in class discussion. It&rsquo;s even nice to laugh at some of their jokes. As part of my assignment as dean I get to visit classrooms for our various Foundations courses. Many times I see students and teachers engaged in vigorous learning. But sometimes a kind of malaise hangs in the air. I define malaise as boredom combined with a dread of what&rsquo;s to come. Is this going to be on the test? How hard is it going to be? Are we going to get a study guide?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tell my students that if they&rsquo;re bored at a classical musical concert, they need to pay closer attention. This also works for devotional talks. Try it in class. Don&rsquo;t put the burden of proof on your teacher to demonstrate to you why the course is important. Instead, listen carefully, look for truth, try to see the beauty in what you are learning. Make the connections yourself, discover how what you are learning relates to everything else you have studied, and how you will put it to use in the rest of your life. Then teach what you have learned to your fellow students. Don't hide the light of your enthusiasm for learning under a bushel. Your teacher will appreciate seeing your face without the mask of indifference in class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This then leads to a third place to look for beauty. While here at BYU-Idaho I invite you to discover the beauty of learning. Make sure that your life doesn&rsquo;t get so hectic and distracted that you only make a shallow acquaintance with shallow things. There are deep things out there, things of eternal moment, things that carry sufficient potency to change the course of your life. But they are not easy. They do not yield their treasures at first glance. They are like rich veins of precious minerals buried deep in the earth. You can&rsquo;t just walk around and pick them up off the ground. Generally those things that are easy to get are worth just about what you pay for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 13th Article of Faith says, &ldquo;If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.&rdquo;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Doctrine and Covenants 88<sup> </sup>also commands us to seek &ldquo;out of the best books words of wisdom&rdquo; and to &ldquo;seek learning, even by study and also by faith.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;We should study &ldquo;things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.&rdquo;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;It sounds like Foundations, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An important reason why we are commanded to study these things is that they testify of God. When we look at the beautiful things of this world, we see the power of God's redeeming love. God&rsquo;s love is in the miracle of new life, the vigor of youth, the abundance of maturity, the tenacity of old age. It is in the seas teeming with diversity, the lichens breaking down the rocks and forming new soil, the boldness of extremophile bacteria living in the most hostile of climates. It is in the creative work of man, in the great gothic cathedrals and Rembrandt&rsquo;s paintings and Mozart&rsquo;s piano concertos and Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s poems. And it is in the obedience of all things to the will of God, the stars and planets rolling on their wings, the earth bringing forth life, all creatures filling the measure of their creation. As the 88<sup>th</sup> Section attests, &ldquo;any man who hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power.&rdquo;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;They deserve more than a cursory glance. They deserve more than memorizing them for the test and then dumping them to make room for the next information glut. They deserve as much of your time and attention as you can muster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, I invite you to ponder the beauty of our Savior&rsquo;s atonement. Each week in sacrament meeting we have the opportunity to reflect on the beauty of Christ&rsquo;s redemptive sacrifice and the potential it has to change our life. The sacrament we keep on Sunday is a reenactment of the Last Supper, when Jesus called his apostles to him the night before his crucifixion and fed them. He did this to commemorate the Jewish Passover, which in turn commemorated the deliverance of the Children of Israel out of Egypt, and the making of a covenant between God and Israel, his peculiar people. Finally, the Deliverance of Israel from Egypt was itself a similitude of the redemption and resurrection wrought by our Savior&rsquo;s atoning sacrifice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Israel we are in bondage&mdash;Israel to Egypt, ourselves to sin. Like Moses, our Savior works great miracles on our behalf to deliver us. And as with ancient Israel, the result of this miraculous deliverance is a covenant relationship&mdash;God promises to be our God, and we to be his people. It is interesting to me that the Lord commands us to commemorate our great redemption by eating and drinking. As you can probably tell, I like to eat. Of course we have to eat to live. But with many of us it goes way beyond that. We love the taste of food. Food is a token of hospitality, of friendship. When a friend comes in from out of town, we eat. When the family gets together we eat. When my father died the people in his small town consoled us with food: they told us they were sorry, and they brought us ham and sloppy joes, cheesy potatoes and homemade cinnamon rolls, cupcakes and casseroles, vegetable and fruit plates. Someone even roasted a turkey. Food is important to us, and so we are commanded to commemorate our redeemer&rsquo;s great sacrifice by eating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably in one of your Foundations of Science classes you learned that bread is mostly made up of complex molecules called starches. When you digest them, starches are first broken down into simpler sugars and then converted into the energy that fuels your body. When you partake of the sacrament, don&rsquo;t be in too much of a hurry to swallow your emblem of bread. Hold it in your mouth, chew it, mix it with your saliva, and notice that as the enzymes convert the starch to sugar it will become sweet. This reminds me of Lehi saying that the fruit of the tree of life was &ldquo;most sweet, above all that [he] ever before tasted.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sacrament prayer tells us that we eat the bread in remembrance of the body of the Savior. Like us, our Savior had a body. From his earthly mother he received the ability to be tempted, to suffer pain, to die. But from his divine Father he received the ability to overcome temptation, to endure, to rise again. The sacrifice of His body makes possible our deliverance from our bodies. Just as bread strengthens our body, so Christ's atonement gives us strength, changes us, purges out the old man, makes us new. Because of Christ's experience with His body, he is patient and longsuffering with the weaknesses of ours. Thus he offers us forgiveness for our sins, and through our repentance he leads us by the Spirit from grace to grace. The author of Hebrews writes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as <em>we are, yet</em> without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&rdquo;<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we drink the water we are reminded of his blood that was shed for us. With it we are washed and cleansed. Like water, true repentance washes the tastes of former actions away. It is cool and refreshing. It cleanses former tastes to prepare the way for new ones, as the Spirit washes away our former life to prepare the way for our new life in Christ. It fills our veins with the power of the Spirit. When you haven&rsquo;t had enough to drink, you become weary and weak. A good drink of water floods energy back into your body. So does the Spirit. Just as water is as essential to life as bread, so is the Spirit as essential as the flesh. &ldquo;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.&rdquo;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;The water at the sacrament reminds us to take time each day to seek living water from the scriptures, the words of the prophets, prayer, and fellowship with the church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At some times and in some theologies men have believed that when the priest consecrates the sacrament it is transformed into the literal flesh and blood of the Savior. We believe in an even greater miracle: We bless and sanctify the emblems so that they will turn our minds to God, so that he can turn us into a new man or woman. It is not the emblems that are transformed, but us. As you sit in sacrament meeting, don&rsquo;t forget to turn your mind to the beauty of the sacrament as it is administered and the miraculous atonement it commemorates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I want you to give due attention to the beauty that is you.&nbsp; John tells us, &ldquo;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.&rdquo;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;You are a son or daughter of God. This is not figurative. What has remained a great mystery to the rest of humanity throughout all ages of the earth is sung by little children in the dispensation of the fullness of times. &ldquo;I am a child of God and he has sent me here.&rdquo;<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it doth not yet appear what we shall be. My voice students often ask me what they are going to be. Am I a soprano or an alto? Or maybe even more to the point, do I have the talent, intelligence, and commitment to succeed in my chosen profession? Or perhaps, how will I make use of the talents God has given me and that I have worked so hard to refine, and at the same time be a father or mother in Zion, serve in the Church, and hold fast to my covenants? I have to tell them that at this moment in time, I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t have a detailed answer to these questions. It doth not yet appear what we shall be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. We need to remember that God, who knows all things, who sees the end from the beginning, sees the beautiful and divine potential in each of us. He has a plan for us, and if we trust and obey him, he will work that plan on our behalf. This is why everyone that hath this hope in him purifieth themselves, even as he is pure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I testify that God lives and loves us. I testify that he has filled the world and the hearts of men with beautiful things for our wonder and enlightenment. I testify that he has a plan for each of us. And I testify that as we live his commandments and confess his hand in all things he will give us a life that is more beautiful than any we could possibly imagine for ourselves.</p>

<p>It is truly an honor for me to be here today. I love this university and I love being associated with the students, staff and faculty here. I pray for the power of the Holy Ghost to be with us here today. May we all be taught by the Spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From where I stand, I have a great view of this magnificent building. It is likely that I see this building much differently than most of you. I see through the eyes of a builder. I have spent much of my life either on a construction site building or teaching about construction processes. I come from four generations of builders. As a young boy I remember my grandfather, who was a retired builder, coming to our home early in the morning to take me along with him to visit construction sites. We would sit together on the tailgate of grandpa&rsquo;s pickup truck watching some of the big buildings in Salt Lake being built. Just like a big-screen action movie, we watched together the heavy machinery digging and lifting and the workers moving up higher and higher, week after week. My father, also a builder, took me along at an early age to clean up job sites and then to work along with his construction crews. I grew up loving construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For over 20 years, I have followed and watched closely the new construction on this campus. This building and the nearby temple are two of my favorites. I remember discussions years ago of how wonderful it would be to have a building on campus large enough that the entire student body could gather to be taught. At that time, the enrollment was about 7,500&ndash;&ndash;half of what it is today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our prayers were answered on May 22, 2006, when President Hinckley announced that a building capable of holding 15,000 would be built and construction would begin as soon as possible. Quickly design work began with professional architects, engineers, and construction managers working closely with Church and university leaders. Shortly after the groundbreaking ceremonies on October 31, 2006, construction began. We all watched with excitement the construction process, winter and summer, from excavation to concrete foundations to the erecting of the giant red steel beams that made up the structural framework. I toured the job site many times, having been invited by past graduates who were part of the construction management team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I look out today, I think back on the sights and sounds of hundreds of construction professionals, large cranes and equipment digging, lifting and hauling. I remember the excitement as the building began to take shape as it slowly rose out of the ground. I continued to watch this building until it was finished and dedicated. Sister Puzey and I were serving our mission in the Philippines so we watched by way of video stream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now standing here with almost x-ray like vision, I can look out and see the giant air handler tunnels just below the floor of those of you sitting in front of me. I see electrical and mechanical systems within the walls and the equipment that supports the lighting, sound, security and the comfortable temperature we enjoy as we sit here today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are truly blessed as we gather together in such a magnificent building where every person on campus can now meet comfortably to learn and be inspired. On December 17, 2010, as President Henry B. Eyring dedicated this building to the Lord, in his prayer he stated, &ldquo;We invoke Thy blessing upon these structures and upon all who will enter them.&rdquo; That is you and I.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now consider with me the fundamental principles that were applied in the construction of this building. The BYU-Idaho Center is built on a strong, firm foundation that supports the great loads that are placed upon it. Each phase of the work comes in a sequence that must be well planned and organized. There is order in all phases of the work and installation of materials and equipment. All materials and control systems are designed and engineered to carry the proper loads, stresses and spans required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Directly over my head is a 258-foot steel king truss weighing tons that is carrying the beams and roof over your head. It allows for a clear span that creates an unencumbered view of the entire stage area. I&rsquo;m confident that it was properly engineered and installed or I wouldn&rsquo;t dare be standing here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I want to take four of the principles that we use in the construction of a building like this and apply them in the building of our own righteous lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>: As with this building, our personal desires direct us to who and what we will become.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>: Discipline and hard work are required in the building of great things.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>: In the building process, be prepared for difficult challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth: </strong>Dedicate yourselves to the Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, what do we really desire to become? We do not build strong and beautiful buildings without strong desires and commitments that carry us to completion. The desires of our hearts and our day-to-day following and building on those desires eventually make us who we are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the April 2011 General Conference, Elder Dallin H. Oaks stated, &ldquo;Desires dictate our priorities, priorities shape our choices, and choices determine our actions.&nbsp; The desires we act on determine our changing, our achieving, and our becoming.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the desires of your heart?&nbsp; Consider them deeply and prayerfully. Write your feeling down, especially the promptings of the Spirit so they will not be lost. You may begin with what you want to ultimately become and then working backwards, making plans on how you will achieve your desires. Just as with Alma&rsquo;s teachings on faith, &ldquo;If ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you&rdquo; (Alma 32:27).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While serving as a mission president in the Philippines, my oldest grandson Tanner, who is seated on the stand with us today, was asked to give a talk in his sacrament meeting on how to prepare to become a missionary. He was 13 years old at the time and had some questions himself on how best to prepare. He quickly sent off an e-mail to me for my advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to ask my 160 full-time missionaries. In a weekly letter to all my missionaries, I explained the situation and asked what they thought was the very most important thing Tanner could do and teach others on how to prepare to serve a mission. The next week all of my missionaries responded. I was a bit surprised that the number one preparation recommended was to have a sincere desire to serve. Becoming begins with desire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prophet Nephi has always been a hero of mine. In his early years he acts upon his desire to know the truth and the knowledge he receives from the Lord becomes a foundation for his righteous life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I often wonder what life was like for young Nephi and his family in the great city of Jerusalem. I imagine him to be a few years younger than most of you. He&rsquo;s a good young man having been taught by goodly parents. I see Nephi as a popular high school student, handsome, large in stature, and happy. He&rsquo;s likely strong and maybe on the starting team of East Jerusalem High&rsquo;s soccer team or whatever sport is popular at the time. He and his brothers are enjoying life and are happy in Jerusalem. Father Lehi and mother Sariah are likely prominent figures in the community living in a very lovely home with much land, gold, silver, and precious things. I imagine their lifestyle to be comfortable and that they are able to afford and enjoy the pleasures of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is contention in the city between those who are righteous and seek to follow the prophets and those who are wicked and seek to fight against and even kill the prophets. Nephi&rsquo;s father, Lehi, being troubled by all of this conflict, goes to the Lord and receives a marvelous vision. Lehi, following the instructions of the Lord, begins to prophesy and warn his friends and all the people of the city. Most turn against him, mocking him and threatening his life. It is then that the Lord commands Lehi in a dream to leave all his possessions and take his family and depart into the wilderness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How would you react when Dad announces in family home evening that he has had a dream and that the family will be leaving everything and moving into the desert? After a few long weeks in the desert, in a hot, smelly, camel-skin tent, the older boys begin to complain and murmur against their father even to the point that they seek to kill him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this time, Nephi needs to know what to do and what to believe. The good life seems to be gone and his own family is fighting and having trouble. Right now he needs to know the truth; he needs a testimony. The scriptures say:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers&rdquo; (1 Nephi 2:16).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shortly after Nephi&rsquo;s visit with the Lord, Lehi asks him and his brothers to return to Jerusalem for the plates of Laban.&nbsp; As you know, his brothers complain and murmur, but Nephi with great faith goes to his father and says to him: &ldquo;I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know the Lord giveth no commandment unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commanded them&rdquo; (1 Nephi 3:7).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What changed for Nephi? His great desire to know was transformed into a great desire to willingly serve the Lord. &ldquo;I will go and do.&rdquo; Some of us have had times in our lives when we were searching for the truth and may have drifted into a state of &ldquo;wishes and whatevers&rdquo; following whatever comes along.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember when I was about 11 years old. I delivered the local weekly newspaper in our town, which paid me a few dollars each week. I remember considering all the wonderful things I could buy with my money. One evening while thumbing through a magazine, I came upon an advertisement for a Lucky Leprechaun. It was a solid silver figure of a leprechaun and the ad told of its magical power and how it was known to bring luck and good fortune to those who processed it. The cost was $7, which seemed like a lot but the leprechaun in the picture appeared quite large and I was sure the pure silver alone was worth the money. All my desires and thoughts turned to receiving wonderful luck, wealth and happiness from my silver leprechaun. It took me several weeks of earnings before I could send off my order, and it seemed like forever in coming, but finally the package arrived that would change my life. When I opened the envelope, I was surprised at how small the little figure was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I resolved in my mind that the size didn&rsquo;t matter. It was the luck it would bring to my life that was most important. I took the little leprechaun everywhere with me, but after a few weeks my excitement faded as I realized nothing had changed in my life. I had paid too much for the small silver leprechaun. However, it did teach me some valuable lessons. I learned to be more careful as to my desires because many things in the world draw us away from what is most important. I also learned that often things are not as they first appear and that luck has much more to do with hard work than just looking to luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prayerfully consider your personal desires and what drives you forward each day. In modern revelation the Lord declares: &ldquo;For I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants 137:9).<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Now the second principle: developing the discipline to work hard. Certainly this building stands as an example of years of hard work. The work was organized, planned, and inspired. Hard work is always difficult, but if we are motivated by strong personal desire and commitment, we can achieve nearly anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my son, Monty, was young, he had a strong desire to become an Eagle Scout. In his early years of Scouting he worked very hard and it appeared that by the time he turned 16 he would have his Eagle. Well, once he began driving and became interested in sports and girls, his desire to become an Eagle Scout began to fade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About a month before turning 18, when he would no longer be eligible to receive his Eagle, he had one more required merit badge to finish. I remember one evening he came to me and said, &ldquo;Dad, I only have one more merit badge to finish my Eagle and only one month to do it in. How can I make <em>me</em> do it?&rdquo; Monty did receive his Eagle Scout award after some hard work and disciplined effort. Over the years I have thought many times of that statement: &ldquo;How can I make <em>me</em> do it&rdquo;?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oliver Cowdery was rebuked by the Lord and not allowed to translate for Joseph for a period of time because, as the Lord described, &ldquo;And, behold, it is because you did not continue as you commenced when you began to translate.&rdquo; Are there things physically, mentally and spiritually that we do not &ldquo;continue as we commenced?&rdquo; If you are like me, I often have good intentions but weaken when those intentions become difficult or other things seem to interfere and distract. For example, most of us have had the desire to get in better physical condition or lose weight, but weaken as eating less and exercising more becomes difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about your desire to become a better student? The dedicated faculty and staff here at BYU-Idaho are working hard to make available resources and opportunities to help you become a disciple-leader in your family, in your community, and in the world. Are you taking charge of your education by applying the Learning Model? What are you doing daily to always have the Spirit with you? Do you struggle to consistently read your scriptures or have regular prayer because of a busy schedule?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as with the construction of this building, we must have a plan and a schedule to follow daily and weekly of what we desire to achieve and then stick to it. Little by little we grow and build into the person we hope to become. We must discipline ourselves to follow and work hard to achieve what we truly desire. The author Aldous Huxley stated: &ldquo;The most valuable of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it has to be done, whether you like it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third: prepare for challenges. During the excavation of this building, the contractor encountered thick layers of lava rock. Heavy equipment digging, hammering, and controlled blasting was required. One by one, large boulders were broken apart and hauled away. Excavation was much more costly and difficult than expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love Nephi&rsquo;s example of not complaining and just going to work when he and his family had traveled in the wilderness and been through many trials. In 1 Nephi 16, we read how their family had camped in order to hunt for food. As you remember, Nephi broke his bow and Laman and Lemuel&rsquo;s bows had lost their spring and they could not obtain food. As the scripture relates:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael did begin to murmur exceedingly because of their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness; and also my father began to murmur against the Lord his God; yea and they were all exceedingly sorrowful, even that they did murmur against the Lord&rdquo; (1 Nephi 16:20).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi, being as hungry and fatigued as the rest, does not complain, but goes to work to solve the problem. Out of a piece of wood he makes a bow and from a straight stick he makes an arrow and then goes to his father for directions on where to hunt. When Nephi returns from a successful hunt we read: &ldquo;and now when they beheld that I had obtained food, how great was their joy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When challenges come, and you can expect they will, don&rsquo;t waste your time complaining. Get to work to solve the problem. In 1997, during the 150th Sesquicentennial Anniversary of the arrival of the pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley, Sister Puzey and I were invited to ride our horses along as outriders for the wagon train that would be entering the Salt Lake Valley. We rode with the wagons and teams of horses in case there were problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One morning as we were working our way up a steep mountain pass, we came to a riverbed that was muddy and difficult to travel through. I moved up alongside the wagon that was about to cross the muddy riverbed and asked the experienced teamster driving what I might do to help. He calmly turned and assured me he would be fine and then added, &ldquo;Always remember on a difficult trail to keep encouraging your horses on and never say &lsquo;whoa&rsquo; in a mud hole.&rdquo; I have always remembered that wisdom in difficult times in my life: &ldquo;Never say &lsquo;whoa&rsquo; in a mud hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, dedicate yourselves to the Lord. At the completion of this great building, the BYU-Idaho Center, it was dedicated to the Lord. After Nephi received his testimony from the Lord and pressed forward through many difficult trials, he proved to the Lord that he would truly go and do the things he was asked to do. Nephi was ready in spirit and determination when the Lord called him to the mountain and gave him instructions on how to build a ship. I wonder if Nephi had ever seen a ship having been raised in the desert areas of Jerusalem. Again, among the mocking and threatening of his brothers, he stood to testify in word and deed as he had before: &ldquo;If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, I know we have a Heavenly Father who loves us and knew well that the building of righteous lives on this earth would be difficult. He sent his Son, the Master Builder of the universe, the perfect example for us to follow to help us along on our journey. I testify that our Savior, Jesus Christ, lives and answers our prayers. In name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<script type="text/javascript"></script>
</p>
<p>Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. Sister Samuelson and I feel privileged to be with you today in your weekly devotional. We appreciate being with many friends who love you all very much. We have known President and Sister Clark, Vice President and Sister Eyring and several of your leaders for a number of years and greatly admire their devoted and inspired service to the university and to the kingdom. It is a treat to watch the remarkable growth and development of this special university over the past decade or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also thrilled to be in this wonderful, spacious and beautiful conference center. The last time that I had the opportunity of speaking at your devotional several years ago, the spirit was great and strong but the surroundings were not so impressive and the audience not so apparently comfortable. Congratulations to all who have contributed to these many successes and especially to your very bright future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am quite sure that President Clark and your other leaders regularly face the same kinds of questions that we receive at BYU. Many have to do with campus policies, traditions and expectations. They are usually good questions, although I am constantly amazed by the small number of students who request more and better exercise equipment while in the same breath complain about the relative lack of parking immediately adjacent to any building on campus they would like to access. The question usually doesn&rsquo;t seem quite as ironic to the askers as it does to me, but we do have fun as we try to reconcile the wish for more equipment and less exercise!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While such questions are perhaps amusing and sometimes even important and enlightening, in our minutes together today, I want to focus on questions both more personal and much more significant. They tend, in the age group of most students on our Church Educational System campuses, to center on such matters as academic major, marriage, missions, and always on the implications for the individual&rsquo;s future. Even though often framed in the &ldquo;what should I do?&rdquo; fashion, what is usually meant is &ldquo;how do I decide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I address this conundrum directly, let me encourage each of us with these struggles to remember how fortunate we really are. Most of the young people living on the earth today have fewer options than you do regarding various paths that might be followed. Some, unfortunately, have so very few as to appear that they might have none at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must, therefore, be grateful for our dilemmas and multiple opportunities because we have the privilege of fully and wisely exercising the great gift of agency, which is so central to Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan for each of His children. It is a tremendous vote of confidence from our Father in Heaven and our Savior, Jesus Christ, to be given so many options, choices and opportunities. When we feel a little burdened or oppressed by the weight and magnitude of the decisions we need to make, we should remember that a third of our spirit siblings in the pre-mortal realm were not willing to take the responsibilities we all chose but rather decided to accept the horrible and limiting consequences of letting someone else decide for them. If we are struggling to enjoy fully living the mortal experience of the &ldquo;Great Plan of Happiness,&rdquo; then we must remember that these most unfortunate spirits have opted to have no choice but to always live with the ever-limiting dimensions of Satan&rsquo;s plan of continual sadness. But, you might say, they at least never need to make a serious decision and you would be correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happily for us, we made the very fundamental determination of accepting the plan of Heavenly Father articulated and implemented by His Son, the Savior. Because our agency and the need to decide regularly about many things, big and little, trivial and important, are so key to the plan, the central role of Jesus Christ must be central to us as well. That is, we must not only acknowledge and accept His sacrifice and atonement, but we must also live in such a way that our hearts, our heads, and our behavior consistently demonstrate we understand what a very big deal our key decisions in life are. If you are not concerned about the most major decisions in your lives, then you should be. If you are concerned, then you should be comforted to realize that you can get proper help in making the right choices. When you fail or fall or make mistakes or commit sins, through proper repentance you can be forgiven and make things right with the help of Heaven and the magnificence of the atonement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we think more about the most important decisions and how we can best decide, let me remind all of us that every decision in life should not carry equal weight. I will share with you an experience I had many years ago in accompanying Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Twelve to a stake conference where the stake presidency was to be reorganized. As part of the process, many of the leaders of the stake are briefly interviewed to seek their counsel and to let the presiding authority get to know them. As this was transpiring, a good man began the interview, not by answering Elder Maxwell&rsquo;s questions, but by saying that he had a personal dilemma on which he wanted some counsel from the apostle. He said that he had a good job and that he and his family were pleased with their current location and circumstances but that he had been offered other enticing employment in another part of the country that would require a move. He said he had carefully considered his options and prayed about them but had received no specific answer and now he was looking to the General Authority to tell him what he should do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an observer myself these many years ago, I was very interested to see how Elder Maxwell might respond. He was kind and asked the good man a further question or two to make sure that he really understood the fellow&rsquo;s dilemma and then inquired as to whether or not the Lord&rsquo;s answer might be a phrase that occurs in our scriptures many times. This is the phrase: &ldquo;It mattereth not.&rdquo; Note that Elder Maxwell didn&rsquo;t tell the good brother that it did not matter, but he did teach him that some decisions may not have earthshaking or eternal consequences. I don&rsquo;t know what the man&rsquo;s final decision was, but it was a great tutorial for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Maxwell made reference, as I recall, that he was wearing brown shoes that day but also had some black shoes at home and had not spent much time or effort deciding which ones he should wear to the stake conference. I don&rsquo;t know whether the man was satisfied or not with the counsel, but I learned an important lesson. Before I finish today, I will relate another personal experience with Elder Maxwell when the answer to the question I asked him really did matter to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, I have developed a series of four questions I ask myself as I try to make important decisions that require and deserve the help of heaven in deciding. Note again I don&rsquo;t consider all the judgments we make about which shirt or blouse or skirt or trousers to wear to require special inspiration. Of course I have the advantage that many of you do not of having my wife Sharon immediately tell me that certain striped ties don&rsquo;t go well with glen plaid suits and white socks are better in the temple than with a tuxedo. Nevertheless, there are important questions which have answers that do matter to you, to those who love you and to heaven as well. With these significant queries, I then try to measure them with these four standards or questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, is what I would like to do or wish to do consistent with the teachings of the scriptures?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standard works of the Church do not address every question we have, but we will often find not only spiritual, but practical advice if we are willing to look carefully and prayerfully. We only have time for a few examples but let me give you one that might be a concern for more than a few here today. If the question is, &ldquo;How should I feel about going into debt for my education?&rdquo; consider this counsel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Doctrine and Covenants: &ldquo;Pay the debt thou hast contracted . . . . Release thyself from bondage&rdquo; (19:35). And this also, &ldquo;Behold, it is said in my laws, or forbidden, to get in debt to thine enemies&rdquo; (64:27). I read in these verses and others you might choose to acknowledge the reality of some debt for really essential things, but we should limit as much as possible what we borrow, pay it off honestly and on time and never borrow from those you would consider to be enemies or those who would take unfair advantage of you. As you study the scriptures carefully, you will find clear and helpful answers to many of the seeming dilemmas you face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, is what I am doing or wish to do consistent with the teachings and counsel of the apostles and prophets?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I trust that you are all familiar with General Conference, the <em>Ensign </em>magazine and the other opportunities we have to be taught by our leaders. Have any of them said anything that might guide you in whether and how you should date? Have they said anything about how we should treat other people? I think you know exactly what I am talking about because you know that they are speaking directly to you and to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, is the matter under your consideration within the bounds of your own stewardship?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Church, every bishop understands that he has keys for his own ward that allow and require that he teach, correct, administer, and even sometimes discipline members of his ward. He might be very inspired and see things in someone else&rsquo;s ward but that is not his responsibility, calling or even his option to become involved. Likewise, each of us has our own stewardship assignments and we must not intrude on those of others. Some of you will think you can teach a better lesson than your assigned Gospel Doctrine, Relief Society or priesthood leader and you might be right except you do not have stewardship for teaching the class unless you have been called to it by proper authority. You can and must leave important decisions of this type to those who own the responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, does the decision you consider impinge on the agency of another?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure it would never occur at BYU-Idaho, but it has on occasion been the case in other places that a very spiritual young man recently home from his mission feels it has been revealed to him that he should marry a certain beautiful young lady of his acquaintance. He should then treat her nicely, ask her on proper dates, get to know her and her family as well as possible and then if he senses things are moving in the right direction, discuss the matter with her. It is true that the converse also could occur. That is, it is the young woman who is the one who feels the inspiration about a potential eternal partnership. She, of course, should follow a similar proper course in making her interest known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is essential for both parties to clearly and fully understand is that each&ndash;&ndash;individually and separately&ndash;&ndash;should receive the inspiration or direction to move forward without undue pressure or influence from another. It will come directly, if it is right, from the Holy Ghost. It will not come from one individual to another as much as at least one of the parties would wish it to be so. You each deserve to know directly and for yourselves. An eternal marriage relationship must never be tinged with buyer&rsquo;s remorse!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might well make adjustments to your own method of evaluation for considering the feelings you have in making major decisions. Our doctrine and Church history are replete with directions and suggestions that can help us in making the important decisions in our lives. Our time permits touching only a few and you will be familiar with them but we all must learn better as Nephi taught to &ldquo;liken them unto [ourselves]&rdquo; (1 Nephi 19:23).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This group will know the life story and experiences of the Prophet Joseph Smith quite well. We sometimes think, in historical shorthand, that the unfolding of the restoration of the gospel just happened. In fact, it began with very big questions, asked in the correct way, and then followed by proper decisions when the answers came. Usually, the framing of the queries and the process to the solutions were not easy. Think of just a few of young Joseph&rsquo;s questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his early teens as Joseph was surrounded by what he described as a &ldquo;war of words and tumult of opinions,&rdquo; he asked himself: &ldquo;What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?&rdquo; (See JS-H 1:10.) I would submit that these are very big questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know what happened next. Let me read his words, not because we don&rsquo;t know them, but because they are so important to the solution of his questions and also to our own. Said Joseph:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James (you see where I got my rule number one), first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: <em>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him</em>&rdquo; (JS-H 1:11).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, this led the 14-year-old Joseph to the Sacred Grove where he had the life-changing interview and instruction with the Father and the Son. We won&rsquo;t take time to review all the questions that Joseph posed, but you will recognize that by the time this unexpected experience ended, he had some answers he had not expected or even imagined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery had their questions answered about baptism because they were doing their duty in translating the Book of Mormon. All that Joseph ever learned and had revealed to him came as the result of careful study and preparation followed by earnest and thoughtful prayer with the determination to follow fully the Lord&rsquo;s will and the answers which he had received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Because fervent and serious prayer is so essential in making proper decisions, it might be understandable, if not excusable, to forget that much more is required of us than just asking Heavenly Father for the answer. You will recall the enlightening experience of Oliver Cowdery. Remember, very early Oliver felt impressed to seek out Joseph and assist him in the translation of the Book of Mormon. He was with Joseph when they received the revelation on baptism and the Aaronic Priesthood from John the Baptist (see Doctrine and Covenants 13) as well as other spiritual manifestations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Oliver was very faithful as a scribe for Joseph in the work of translation, he also, reasonably, expressed an interest in trying his own hand at this sacred work. In Section 8 of the Doctrine and Covenants, we learn that the Lord granted Oliver&rsquo;s wish to have the gift of translation as well as giving him some wonderful counsel and insights on the spirit of revelation. Because Oliver apparently did not immediately attempt to translate himself, he was not able to do so at a later time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think we can imagine that he was disappointed and likely confused. He knew he had been granted a gift, but apparently did not proceed in a timely fashion and the gift was then temporarily withdrawn. Let me read several verses from the 9th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants to review what the Lord said to a disappointed Oliver:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be patient, my son, for it is wisdom in me, and it is not expedient that you should translate at this present time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, the work which you are called to do is to write for my servant Joseph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not murmur, my son, for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after this manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants 9:3-9).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lots of lessons can and should be learned by careful study of our Church history and the scriptures. We also can learn from the experiences of others. If I may, please let me share a personal experience that was very helpful to me in making an important decision. It taught me that getting proper inspiration and direction from heaven requires more than just going through the motions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the time I was deeply involved in my postdoctoral fellowship at Duke University after completing my medical internship and residency, I was approached with several interesting opportunities for my future academic career. I admit that the entreaties were flattering and most looked attractive. The problem for us was that we were very happy at Duke and in living in Durham, North Carolina. We loved our ward, our friends and felt that the academic experience was first-rate. While we missed our extended families, all living in the West, we felt we would return there some day and were quite content that we were exactly where we ought to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, we prayed about our options and opportunities, but did not feel any compulsion or even inclination to do so more than just casually mention our preferences in our prayers. Happily for us, a man who later became a good friend and mentor sized me up much better than I had myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day he called me about an opportunity that we had discussed twice in recent weeks. Not wanting to close any doors for future opportunities, my answer to him on those two occasions was that I appreciated the offer, the position was attractive, but the timing was not right and therefore I needed to decline. On the third call, he simply said that he understood my position and that the offer was the same as before. He then said if I could assure him that I had gone about the decision-making process in exactly the right way, he would not bother me again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not know Dr. John A. Dixon very well at that point, although I knew he was a faithful Latter-day Saint and a former bishop. His question about &ldquo;exactly the right way&rdquo; caught me off guard and led to new and serious consideration about what that really meant and what I really should do. Without further details, I will report that we went about the process in the right way and got the right answer&ndash;&ndash;an answer the Lord would not provide when we prayed as if we already knew the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process led me to leave my position at Duke and return to my alma mater. While perhaps not nearly as earthshaking as was President Clark&rsquo;s leaving Harvard for BYU-Idaho, it was traumatic for us. My chairman at Duke thought I was committing career suicide and even gave me the chance, which I did not take, to repent of the decision a couple of years later. The fact that my decision was not understood by most didn&rsquo;t matter. Now almost forty years later, some of my associates from that time acknowledge that perhaps the decision was not too bad after all since I seem to have been very happy over the years. What is not clear to most is that this was a very pivotal time in our life and many of the opportunities and experiences we have enjoyed over the years would not have been ours if our good friend had not insisted that we make our decision in exactly the right way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of us have important crossroad decisions to make in our lives. At this time for most of you they center around issues of missions, marriage, and academic majors, as I mentioned at the outset. Sometimes the answer will be &ldquo;it mattereth not,&rdquo; but more often than most of us suspect it will be that it mattereth very, very much. Thus, it is vital that we never be confused or deflected from the responsibility and privilege of deciding and choosing in the right ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, as I conclude I will share the experience with Elder Maxwell that was so important to me. The details are not vital for today&rsquo;s purposes and as I would not wish to cast negative reflections on anyone, I will be economical with the specifics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 20 years ago and before I was called as a General Authority, I had a very difficult professional decision to make. I considered the matter every way I could and believe I did so in exactly the right way. I was still confused. Whatever I decided, it would likely affect in significant ways the lives of people I cared about and who cared for me. Because I knew that Elder Maxwell was familiar with several of the details and people involved in my dilemma, I sought his counsel and advice. His response surprised me and frankly initially severely disappointed me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In great detail, I presented the facts of the matter and my analysis to him. He listened quietly and carefully. When I finished, he remained silent for more than a few seconds and then said simply, &ldquo;Above all else, you must protect your integrity.&rdquo; That was all. I waited for his reasoning and further counsel but none was forthcoming and it became very clear that the meeting was over. He was not angry or dismissive in nature, but clearly was not going to say anything more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I left his office and returned to my own, I was confused and frustrated. I knew that he knew more than he said. Why didn&rsquo;t he just tell me what to do? As I puzzled over this, I then realized after two or three hours of agony and angst that he had given me the real answer that I needed. Once I recognized that my integrity was more important than the perceptions of friends or the approval of associates, the course that I needed to follow was crystal clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like our Heavenly Father who knows all, Elder Maxwell who knew so very much could have given me the answer but in doing so he would have usurped my agency and the growth that could come from my making important decisions properly. As I have come to understand these principles better, my feelings of disappointment and frustration have transformed to profound appreciation and admiration for the ability of this disciple of the Savior to teach so effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is my prayer that all of us will work very hard to make the proper decisions in our lives with understanding and gratitude to our Heavenly Father for the gift of agency and the privilege to grow by governing our lives properly by always deciding in the Lord&rsquo;s chosen way. The gospel is true, including the provisions it makes for us to become wiser, more faithful, more teachable and more faithful. God bless you in your important decisions with the comfort that the Holy Ghost will bring when you follow the Lord&rsquo;s prescribed patterns. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><img src="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/images/Cardon.jpg" border="0" alt="Craig A. Cardon" title="Craig A. Cardon" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<script type="text/javascript"></script>
</p>
<p>Several years ago, prior to my calling as a General Authority, Sister Cardon and I attended a dinner for members of the Dean&rsquo;s Alumni Leadership Council at the Harvard Kennedy School. There were about 40 people in attendance, comprising about 20 council members and their companions. We were seated at round tables, eight persons at each table. After the dinner, the president of the council announced that rather than a speaker, he and the dean had decided to invite each council member and companion to stand and introduce himself or herself, using a microphone that would be passed from table to table. He suggested that each person share his or her educational and professional background information, along with what each considered to be his or her most significant accomplishment. The process then began at the table where the president and the dean were seated. Because of the way the room was organized, it soon became clear that our table would be the last to participate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this may seem uneventful, there was something rather remarkable that occurred with Sister Cardon that evening. She later explained to me what she had experienced. Sister Cardon had been with me to other similar events with guest speakers and had in those occasions quietly enjoyed the evening. However, on this evening, as she saw all in attendance standing and espousing their many academic degrees and professional accomplishments, she started thinking, &ldquo;Wait a minute. This isn&rsquo;t what I had planned on.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the microphone was passed from table to table she thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really going to be expected to say something. What am I going to say? What can I possibly say to these people who have been ambassadors, high government officials, educators, professionals, and leaders of gigantic enterprises? I don&rsquo;t even have my bachelor&rsquo;s degree yet. (She would later receive it from BYU after eight devoted years of distance learning.) Sister Cardon&rsquo;s mind continued racing: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to think of something to say. No, I&rsquo;ve got to leave. I&rsquo;ve got to find an excuse to leave. There is nothing I can say to these people.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her heart began to pound rapidly and she really didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Then, in an instant, she remembered thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pray.&rdquo; With this, she said a silent, earnest prayer, pleading with the Lord for His help and direction. She later told me that in that moment, a voice came into her mind with perfect clarity. &ldquo;Debbie, who in this room has achieved more important things in this life than you, or has had more amazing experiences than you? You are a mother in Zion. You have brought eight children into this world. They are happily married and are having children of their own. What is more important than that? Debbie, you get up and tell these people with power what you have done.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At about that moment, the microphone was passed from the adjacent table to our table. I had seen Sister Cardon earlier shifting in her chair, a bit uneasy, so I extended my hand to take the microphone, thinking to give her some additional time and space. Imagine my surprise when her hand stretched out in front of mine and literally grabbed the microphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She confidently stood, and with an elegance difficult to adequately describe, she said: &ldquo;A few years ago I accompanied my husband here to the Harvard Kennedy School. And my most important achievement is that I am the mother of eight children and the grandmother of eighteen grandchildren&rdquo; (the number at the time).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that statement, spontaneous applause erupted in the room. It was the only applause of the entire evening. She shared a few additional thoughts relating to the central, societal role of the family and the happiness found therein, then handed me the microphone and sat down. I stood and added simply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m her husband.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The significance of what the Lord did through Sister Cardon was evidenced by the fact that for the remainder of the evening we were inundated by questions from those at our table, and later by others at the dinner asking about families, requesting specific counsel in rearing children, and desiring to know how to foster marital harmony&ndash;&ndash;subjects eminently more important than anything else that had been addressed. Because she had earnestly sought direction from the Spirit, and had exercised the faith and courage to respond to what she was told, the Lord had magnified Sister Cardon in a powerful way in furthering His purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My desire is to share with you today some thoughts about these types of experiences, with the prayer that in the process you will be able to understand more fully from the Lord what it means to be, as the scriptures describe it, &ldquo;a man of God,&rdquo; with its implied companion meaning, &ldquo;a woman of God,&rdquo; and to invite you to become men and women of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The appellation &ldquo;man of God&rdquo; is used in scripture to describe Moses, Samuel, Elijah, Elisha, Abinadi, Alma and his sons, Ammon and the other sons of Mosiah, &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; Moroni, and Nephi, the son of Helaman. Certainly, the appellation accurately describes all the prophets of God and other holy men who have engaged and now engage in the Lord&rsquo;s work. Although not found in the scriptures, the companion appellation &ldquo;woman of God&rdquo; would accurately describe women such as Sarah, Ruth, Deborah, Sariah, Mary, the mother of Jesus, Mary and Martha, Mary Magdalene, and their dear sisters of years past and current days who faithfully engage in the Lord&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we desire to become men and women of God, we might appropriately ask: &ldquo;What are the attributes of a man or a woman of God?&rdquo; Certainly, such attributes mirror the attributes of Deity. There may be many attributes that come to mind. There is a listing of some of these attributes in Doctrine and Covenants 4, a section I am convinced many in attendance could quote from memory. The sixth verse reads: &ldquo;Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To give these attributes greater contextual meaning, have you ever attempted to associate an individual with each attribute, tying the name of someone you know personally or have come to know through the scriptures to the attribute? Knowing another individual who struggled with the vicissitudes of life and managed to inculcate a divine attribute in his or her life provides a powerful example that may assist us in our efforts to do the same. Consider the following examples from the lives of men of God:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the attribute of faith, consider the brother of Jared. Notwithstanding he was &ldquo;chastened&hellip; because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord,&rdquo; yet &ldquo;he repented of the evil which he had done, and did call upon the name of the Lord&hellip;&rdquo; As he prayed regularly, the brother of Jared was directed in his work. Eventually, a matter arose needing further direction. Rather than again providing direct instruction, the Lord invited the brother of Jared to find the solution. This he did, and took 16 small molten stones to the Lord to now ask for something that only the Lord could do. In deep humility, he asked the Lord to &ldquo;touch [the] stones.&rdquo; As you know, in this experience, the brother of Jared saw the pre-mortal Savior &ldquo;[b]ecause of [his] faith&hellip;,&rdquo; and the Lord told him, &ldquo;never has man come before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast&hellip;.&rdquo; There are lessons and practical experiences in the life of the brother of Jared that help us to better understand faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the attribute of virtue, consider Joseph of old, who &ldquo;got him out&rdquo; when tempted by Potiphar&rsquo;s wife. Joseph&rsquo;s life is synonymous with virtue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I think of knowledge I think of Abraham who &ldquo;sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto [he] should be ordained to administer the same; having been [himself] a follower of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge&hellip;, and desiring to receive instructions, and to keep the commandments of God&hellip; became a rightful heir&hellip;.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I think of knowledge, I think of Abraham.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For temperance, consider Daniel who &ldquo;would not defile himself with the portion of the king&rsquo;s meat, nor with the wine which he drank.&rdquo; Said he to the prince of the eunuchs, &ldquo;Prove [us], I beseech thee, ten days, and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. &hellip;And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king&rsquo;s meat.&rdquo; Daniel&rsquo;s life epitomized temperance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many prophets have endured difficult things that have imbued them with patience. I think of Joseph Smith and his words from the jail at Liberty which are perhaps most emblematic. &ldquo;O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place? How long&hellip;.&nbsp; Yea, O Lord, how long&hellip;. O Lord God Almighty, maker of heaven, earth, and seas, and of all things that in them are, and who controllest and subjectest the devil, and the dark and benighted dominion of Sheol&mdash;stretch forth thy hand&hellip;.&rdquo; Then came the Lord&rsquo;s response, &ldquo;My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.&rdquo; Through patience, Joseph Smith &ldquo;[possessed] his soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For brotherly kindness, there could perhaps be no greater example than Nephi, whose older brothers &ldquo;[bound him] with cords for they sought to take away [his] life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Through his exercise of faith, the Lord gave him strength to burst the bands and his brothers were eventually &ldquo;sorrowful&rdquo; for what they had done. Evidencing great brotherly kindness Nephi simply records, &ldquo;&hellip;I did frankly forgive them&hellip;.&rdquo; Notwithstanding their rudeness, Nephi was kind to his brothers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When studying the attribute of godliness, consider Moses. To prepare the minds of the children of Israel for the coming of the Messiah, Moses taught them that the Lord God would raise up a prophet &ldquo;like unto me,&rdquo; like unto Moses. The Savior later confirmed that He was that prophet. It was this same Moses who &ldquo;plainly taught&hellip;the children of Israel&rdquo; that &ldquo;in the ordinances [of the priesthood], the power of godliness is manifest.&rdquo; Moses is a good example of godliness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For charity, consider Mormon. From the heart of this faithful prophet and valiant military leader who prepared the sacred book of scripture that bears his name, comes this counter-intuitive yet remarkably inspired counsel to his people who were then immersed in despair and destruction. &ldquo;Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth.&nbsp; Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail&mdash; But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.&rdquo; When I think of charity, I think of Mormon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I think of humility, I think of Enoch. When he was called to prophesy unto the people and to call them to repentance, &ldquo;he bowed himself to the earth, before the Lord, and spake before the Lord saying: &ldquo;Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?&rdquo; What followed was a city that was taken into heaven. Enoch exemplifies humility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For all who know him, Thomas S. Monson is synonymous with diligence. His life, his very being, defines diligence. Just last April in General Priesthood Meeting he shared these words:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love and cherish the noble word <em>duty</em> and all that it implies.&nbsp; In one capacity or another, in one setting or another, I have been attending priesthood meetings for the past 72 years&mdash;since I was ordained a deacon at the age of 12. Time certainly marches on. Duty keeps cadence with that march. Duty does not dim nor diminish. Catastrophic conflicts come and go, but the war waged for the souls of men continues without abatement. Like a clarion call comes the word of the Lord to you, to me, and to priesthood holders everywhere: &ldquo;Wherefore, now let every man learn his <em>duty</em>, and to act in the office in which he is appointed in all diligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas S. Monson is a great example of diligence. Like all of these men of God, we can develop these divine attributes in our own lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My study of the attributes of a man of God or a woman of God was enriching and enlightening and led me to formulate an even more focused question: &ldquo;What is the defining characteristic of a man or a woman of God?&rdquo; Almost immediately upon asking this question, the following thoughts came to mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all of the divine attributes one may possess, a man or a woman of God does the will of the Father. This defining characteristic may be developed, refined, and strengthened in our lives, but it takes effort. Indeed, speaking of men in these latter days the Lord has said, &ldquo;They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way&hellip;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you consider your own circumstances at this formative time in your young lives, the following statements may provide a helpful guide to those who desire to have this characteristic become a part of them, even to define who they are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in all righteous endeavors, the Savior is our great Exemplar. Indeed, His thought provoking question and loving invitation to the people in the land of Bountiful continues on through eternity: &ldquo;Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be?&nbsp; Verily I say unto you, even as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider these few examples from the many found in the Savior&rsquo;s life and teachings. Understanding the Father&rsquo;s plan, the Savior took an initiative at the pool of Bethesda on the Sabbath day, knowing full well the consequences that would follow. Knowing the will of the Father in accomplishing that plan, the Savior saw a man who had been impotent for 38 years, and although the man did not ask for a blessing, the Savior asked him, &ldquo;Wilt thou be made whole?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the man explained his futile attempts at receiving a blessing in the pool, &ldquo;Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.&rdquo; The Savior did the will of the Father. This Sabbath day healing caused much consternation among the Jewish leaders. When they learned that it was Jesus who had performed the miracle, they persecuted him and &ldquo;sought to slay him.&rdquo; In this setting, which the Lord had knowingly instigated, Jesus answered them saying, &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.&rdquo; That pattern is characteristic of a man of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later in His ministry, in the synagogue in Capernaum, the Savior gave what is perhaps the most succinct expression of this divine characteristic as He taught the people and the Jewish leaders saying, &ldquo;For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of our own personal conversion, it is worth considering carefully the significance of the similar words the Savior used to define His gospel to the people in the land of Bountiful. Said He, &ldquo;Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you&mdash;that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it is a doctrinal verity that all of those who come to this earth are literally spirit sons and spirit daughters of God, our Heavenly Father, this last phrase, &ldquo;because my Father sent me,&rdquo; introduces the final element I would like to address today in describing what it means to be a man or a woman of God. Clearly, it involves something more than the all-inclusive description of sons and daughters. Jesus knew who He was, and is, and that His Father had given Him a mission to accomplish. He knew that His father had sent Him.&nbsp; Similarly, a man or a woman of God, knows who he or she is and that God has a work for him or her to do. Please note, however, that men and women of God must first become sons and daughters of Christ, being born of Him. Listen to the words of King Benjamin:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters. And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This final element of being a man or a woman of God is remembering who you really are and what God expects of you as believers in, and obeyers of, the gospel of Jesus Christ. Jesus always remembered that His Father had sent Him and what He wanted Him to say and do. A man or a woman of God remembers the same. The Savior adds emphasis and meaning with these words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And behold, ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. The Father having raised me up unto you first, and sent me to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities; and this because ye are the children of the covenant&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, this is a marvelous and exciting time of life for you. You are at the threshold of many important decisions involving personal habits, private practices, education, missions, dating, marriage, family, employment, where you will live, religious commitments, community involvement, and more. In all of this, the Lord wants you to know that you are children of the covenant. You are part of a grand design, which is our Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan. And He wants you to remember that as you live faithfully you are the means whereby the families of the earth are blessed, and the Lord&rsquo;s purposes are realized. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now in closing, I extend to all of you an invitation. It is an invitation I pray you are more able and willing to accept because of what you know and understand, perhaps a bit better now than you did a few minutes ago. This is the invitation: if you have not yet exercised your faith, repented of your sins, entered the waters of baptism, and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, I invite you to do so now. It will bring you the greatest happiness you will know in this life. Once you have done this, I invite you to do what I now invite those who have already entered the &ldquo;gate&rdquo; to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have already entered the gate, I invite you to be men and women of God. You do this by continuing on along the &ldquo;path&rdquo; on which you have set your feet, &ldquo;[enduring] to the end.&rdquo; As Nephi said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, may each of you develop the attributes of deity in your personal life. May each of you do the will of the Father, making this the defining characteristic of your life. You will be able to do that as you study and pray, as you experience life, as you come to recognize the voice of the Spirit, and as you exercise your faith in following that voice, just like Sister Cardon did. Like Abraham, Moses, President Monson, and so many others, you will find that your capacity to recognize and follow that voice will grow in what may seem at the time to be small, even insignificant ways. But as you continue to listen and to act, the Lord will magnify you to the accomplishing of His purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally, may each of you remember who you really are and what God expects of you, always remembering that the Lord has a mission for you to accomplish. May you all become men and women of God, that He may eventually say of you, as He said of Joseph Smith, &ldquo;And I will make him great in mine eyes; for he shall do my work.&rdquo; In your efforts, you may look to the prophets for guidance, and you will always find in Christ the perfect example. Of Him I testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for bringing your scriptures today. I am grateful that this learning experience we have together means enough to you that you not only come, but that you come prepared. Now, please open your scriptures to Doctrine and Covenants 135:3. We will read the first few lines of this verse together. As we read, I invite you to consider these questions: Do you believe what you are being told in this verse? If you do, can you defend it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, do not take what you read here for granted. Consider carefully what you are being told as it is likely one of the most bold statements of scripture that you will find. Ponder it. Teach yourself why it is so. For example, when you return to your homes after devotional today, take a moment and write down all of the evidences that you can think of that validate the truthfulness of this scriptural verse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you could phrase your comments this way: &ldquo;Because of Joseph Smith, I have the blessing of&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Because of Joseph Smith, I can&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you fill in the blanks with as many responses as you can think of. If you will do this, I promise you that you will deepen your love, your appreciation, and your personal witness of the Prophet Joseph Smith. As you create your evidences list, I offer the following. Consider what this man, who once describe himself as &ldquo;obscure&rdquo; and &ldquo;of no consequence in the world&rdquo; (JS 1:22-23), accomplished in the short span of his life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the age of 14, he received a visit from God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ (Spring 1820). At the age of 17, he received five visits from Moroni giving instructions and training (September 21-22, 1823). At the age of 21, he received the golden plates from the Angel Moroni at the Hill Cumorah (September 22, 1827). At the age of 23, he and Oliver Cowdery received the Aaronic Priesthood from John the Baptist; they then baptized each other (May 15, 1829).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon after, he and Oliver Cowdery received the Melchizedek Priesthood from Peter James and John (May or June of 1829). At the age of 24, he oversaw the printing of 5,000 copies of the Book of Mormon at the Grandin Press (March 26, 1830). Also at the age of 24, he organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with six incorporators as required by law (April 6, 1830).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between the ages of 25-29, he called Edward Partridge as the &ldquo;bishop unto the Church&rdquo; (February 4, 1831), he organized the First Presidency (March 18, 1833), the Quorum of the Twelve (February 14, 1835), and the First Quorum of the Seventy (February 28, 1835). At the age of 30, he dedicated the Kirtland Temple (March 17, 1836), and received all the priesthood keys for this dispensation (April 3, 1836).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the age of 35, he founded the city of Nauvoo, Illinois (December 16, 1840). At the age of 36, he organized the Relief Society (March 17, 1842). And, at the age of 38, he and Hyrum were killed by a mob at Carthage Jail (June 27, 1844). Their deaths sealed the truthfulness of their witness to the world of the things they proclaimed and taught. As you continue to create your evidence list, I invite you to yet dig deeper into what this man did for us and for the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider what we know about the true nature of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. Consider what we know about our Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan for us and our relationship to Him, our Savior, and one another. Consider what we know about the exalting doctrines of the Savior&rsquo;s gospel. Consider what we have been given in terms of ordinances, covenants, and priesthood authority that binds and blesses. Consider the many millions of souls beyond the veil who, by the actions of the Saints in this dispensation, now have access to those saving ordinances and covenants. Consider the modern day scripture that has been revealed and given to us: The Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Consider all that has been revealed and all that we testify of as true. All of this precious knowledge, all of these sanctifying blessings are given us by our grand dispensation head, Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that of him, John Taylor, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles wrote: &ldquo;Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants 135:3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think not. And, I bear you my own personal witness that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that he indeed did do more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we will recognize the 168<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Today, I not only want to encourage our spiritual awareness and heartfelt thanks to God for what this man, Joseph Smith, has done for us and for the world. I want to inspire an understanding of the events leading to his martyrdom because in the act of voluntarily laying his life down for truth&ndash;&ndash;which is exactly what he did&ndash;&ndash;he gave the highest allegiance to truth, the most enduring witness of truth that a human can possibly give. He did it because he wants the world to know&ndash;&ndash;he wants you and I to know&ndash;&ndash;that what he was given and what he taught was absolute truth. He was bound by it and could not even think to renounce something that was so much a part of him. We owe it to him to understand these events and reverence the memory of his personal witness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our discussion begins near the end of his life. Joseph Smith lived with the constant harassment of those who were enemies of truth. Time and time again, his life was preserved&ndash;&ndash;often miraculously&ndash;&ndash;that he might continue his work of restoration. Toward the end, when mob activity became more bold and intense, and more importantly, as his work was completed, the Prophet approached his impending death with a stoic dignity. He never bemoaned a life of ill-treatment; and, as far as I can tell, he never let himself ask, &ldquo;Does the Lord ask too much of me?&rdquo; He never flinched from that which he knew was true. He never doubted&ndash;&ndash;even when the whole world seemed against him&ndash;&ndash;his experiences and his knowledge of truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These facts, brothers and sisters, are to me some of the most remarkable evidences of the truthfulness of his claim to be called of God as any I can imagine. I cannot conceive of one who could initiate, maintain, and defend a charade of falsity and face certain death because of it without flinching, without relinquishing in some form or degree. Joseph never flinched and never relinquished, because what Joseph taught was truth. Therefore, he stood boldly, even in the face of death, proclaiming&ndash;&ndash;with the offering of his own life&ndash;&ndash;the veracity of his claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The events that led up to his martyrdom, at least for our purposes today, began on the 10<sup>th</sup> of June, 1844, with an ordinance passed by the Nauvoo City Council to abate a newspaper press called the <em>Nauvoo Expositor</em>, a newspaper hostile to the Saints. Hence, it was defined, under the City&rsquo;s Charter, as a &ldquo;nuisance.&rdquo; The declaration that this paper was a nuisance and the subsequent order to destroy it was done because of the libelous and slanderous character of the paper which had, as its avowed purpose, the destruction of Nauvoo and the driving of the Saints therefrom&rdquo; (HC, vol. 6, 432).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, mayor of Nauvoo, was given charge by the Council to abate the nuisance.&nbsp; He immediately &ldquo;ordered the Marshal to destroy it without delay&hellip;&rdquo; (HC, Vol. 6, 432). On Monday, June 17, 1844, Joseph Smith and others were arrested for the destruction of the <em>Nauvoo Expositor</em> press. They appeared before a Justice Wells and &ldquo;after a long and close examination&rdquo; by him, were discharged (HC, Vol. 6, 487).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This did not satisfy the enemies of Joseph, and mob activity intensified. The day that Joseph and others were dismissed by Justice Wells, June 17, 1844), he received a report from Stephen Markham that a mob could be expected to make an immediate attack upon the citizens and city of Nauvoo. The mobs intent, he reported, was the extermination of the Latter-day Saints (HC, Vol. 6, 492).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response, and again acting as mayor, Joseph called out the Nauvoo Legion, a military body, to &ldquo;take such measures as shall be necessary to preserve the peace&rdquo; of Nauvoo and its residents.&nbsp; The following day, June 18, 1844, and as deciphered from the local newspapers around them, Joseph declared:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have good reason to fear that a mob is organizing to come upon this city, and plunder and destroy said city, as well as murder the citizens; and by virtue of the authority vested in me as Mayor, and to preserve the city and the lives of the citizens, I do hereby declare the said city, within the limits of its incorporation, under martial law&rdquo; (HC, Vol. 6, 497).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one was to enter or leave the city without proper orders. These actions, while prudent given the circumstances, seemed to further incite the ire and unrest of the mob. On Thursday, June 20, 1844, Joseph, seeming to understand the dire circumstances that lie ahead, sent correspondence to the ten apostles who were absent on missions to come home immediately (HC, Vol. 6, 519). The other two apostles, John Taylor and Willard Richards, were already with Joseph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Saturday, June 22, 1844, Illinois Governor Thomas Ford, in letter demanded that Joseph and others come to Carthage to stand trial again for the <em>Expositor</em> affair. He threatened a calling out of the militia, comprised primarily of men anxious for the destruction of the Saints, if his demands were not met (HC, Vol. 6, 533-537).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offering his defense, Joseph responded to the letter the day it was received (HC, Vol. 6, 538-541). His response was personally delivered to the governor by John Taylor. Brother Taylor was poorly received and treated by the governor and reported back to Joseph that the governor was surrounded by &ldquo;some of the vilest and most unprincipled men in creation&rdquo; (HC, Vol. 6, 542-545). In hearing of this report, Joseph counseled with his brother Hyrum and asked, &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; (HC, Vol. 6, 545)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By and by the prophet made a decision to cross the Mississippi River with Hyrum and begin traveling west. Joseph told the people &ldquo;there is no doubt they will come here (Nauvoo) and search for us. Let them search; they will not harm you in person or property, and not even a hair of your head&rdquo; (HC, Vol. 6, 545-546). With that prophetic statement, Joseph and Hyrum said goodbye to their families and crossed the Mississippi by boat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Sunday, June 23, 1844, early in the morning, a posse, sent by the governor, arrived in Nauvoo to arrest Joseph and Hyrum. They did not find them. They leave the city with a man by the name of Yates left behind to keep watch. This Yates mentioned to one of the brethren that Governor Ford was intent on getting Joseph and Hyrum even if it meant guarding the city for three years (HC, Vol. 6, 548-549). This frightened the Saints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emma Smith sent a message to Joseph asking him to return. In addition, Reynolds Cahoon, Lorenzo D. Wasson, and Hiram Kimball accused Joseph of cowardice for wishing to leave the people. Said they, &ldquo;Like the fable, when the wolves came the shepherd ran from the flock, and left the sheep to be devoured.&rdquo; How hurtful this must have been for Joseph to hear. His response, &ldquo;If my life is of no value to my friends, it is of none to myself&rdquo; (HC, Vol. 6, 549).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph again counseled with his brother Hyrum, &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; Hyrum&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;Let us go back and give ourselves up, and see the thing out.&rdquo; Joseph pondered this and said, &ldquo;If you go back I will go with you, but we shall be butchered&rdquo; (HC, Vol. 6, 549-550). Joseph and Hyrum returned to Nauvoo and prepared for their journey to Carthage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, June 24, 1844, Joseph and Hyrum, after taking care of matters of business and after preparing the people for their departure, traveled to Carthage, Illinois. En route, Joseph made his prophetic declaration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer&rsquo;s morning. I have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward all men. If they take my life I shall die an innocent man, and my blood shall cry from the ground for vengeance, and it shall be said of me &lsquo;He was murdered in cold blood!&rsquo;&rdquo;(HC, Vol. 6, 555)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They arrived at the Hamilton House, a guesthouse and tavern in Carthage, just before midnight. On the morning of Tuesday, June 25, 1844, Joseph and Hyrum voluntarily surrendered themselves to the constable at Carthage. They were arrested for treason against the state of Illinois because they called out the Nauvoo Legion (HC, Vol. 6, 565). They were taken to the Carthage Jail. Every attempt was made to solicit help from those in authority to protect Joseph and Hyrum but to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Thursday, June 27, 1844, those who were with Joseph and Hyrum are removed from the jail. Ultimately, only four men remain:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, Age 38</p>
<p>First Elder, President, and Prophet of the Church</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hyrum Smith, Age 44</p>
<p>Second Elder, Associate President, and Patriarch to the Church</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John Taylor, Age 35</p>
<p>Editor of two Nauvoo newspapers: the <em>Times and Seasons</em> and the <em>Nauvoo Neighbor</em>; Apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Willard Richards, Age 40</p>
<p>Physician and Secretary to Joseph, Apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was hot and muggy on the afternoon of June 27, 1844. The men confined in the Carthage Jail had their coats off. John Taylor wrote of the scene in the jail cell: &ldquo;All of us felt unusually&hellip;languid, with a remarkable depression of spirits. In consonance with those feelings I sang a song, that had lately been introduced into Nauvoo, entitled, &lsquo;A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief.&rsquo; After a lapse of some time, Brother Hyrum requested me again to sing that song. I replied, &lsquo;Brother Hyrum, I do not feel like singing,&rsquo; when he remarked, &lsquo;Oh, never mind; commence singing, and you will get the spirit of it.&rsquo; At his request I did so&rdquo; (HC, Vol. 7, 101-102).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the hymn, Joseph was conversing with the guard, Hyrum had just finished reading excerpts from Josephus&rsquo; &ldquo;Antiquities of the Jews&rdquo; and was visiting with Willard Richards when there was a rustling at the outer door of the jail, and a cry of &ldquo;Surrender!&rdquo; The discharge of firearms followed. Willard Richards glanced out the window and saw about a hundred armed men around the door. It is recorded that what I now describe to you occupied no more than two or three minutes&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the mob rushed up the stairs, past the guard, and began the work of death, while others fired through the open windows of the jail. Immediately, the men inside the jail sprang to the door in an attempt to brace themselves against it and block entry of the mob. Guns continued to be fired and one ball came through the door. Joseph, John Taylor, and Willard Richards sprang to the left of the door for safety, all the while trying to knock aside the guns as they were being inserted through thru the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the same instance, Hyrum retreated back remaining in front of the door when a ball came through the door and struck him in the left side of his nose, and he fell on his back on the floor, crying, as he fell: &ldquo;I am a dead man.&rdquo; As he fell, another ball from the outside entered his left side, and passed through his body. Another ball from the door grazed his breast, and entered his head by the throat; subsequently, a fourth ball entered his left leg. He never moved afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph fell to Hyrum. John Taylor records, &ldquo;I shall never forget the deep feeling of sympathy and regard manifested in the countenance of Brother Joseph as he drew nigh to Hyrum, and, leaning over him, exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh! My poor, dear brother Hyrum!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A shower of balls was pouring into the room. John Taylor did his best to parry the guns at the door until at length, he found the exercise futile and he attempted to jump out the window, where a ball fired from within struck him on his left thigh. He fell forward to the windowsill, when another ball fired from outside struck his watch and threw him back into the room. This watch recorded the time of the martyrdom: 5:16:26 p.m.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After John Taylor fell back into the room, he was hit by two more balls, one of them injuring his left wrist and the other entering at the side of the bone just below the left knee. He rolled for cover under the bed. While he lay there, he was fired upon several times from the stairway; one ball struck him on the left hip, which tore the flesh in a shocking manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph, seeing that there was no safety in the room, and no doubt thinking that it would save the lives of his brethren in the room if he could get out, turned calmly from the door, and sprang into the window. He was now in full view of the mob firing at him from below. Instantly, two balls pierced him from the door, and one entered his right breast from without. He fell outward into the hands of his murderers, exclaiming, &ldquo;O Lord, my God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Richards&rsquo; escape was miraculous; he being a very large man, and in the midst of a shower of balls, yet he stood unscathed, with the exception of a ball which grazed the tip end of the lower part of his left ear. His escape fulfilled literally a prophecy which Joseph made over a year previously, that the time would come when balls would fly around him like hail, and he should see his friends fall on the right and on the left, but that there should not be a hole in his garment</p>
<p>(HC, Vol. 6, 616-621; HC, Vol. 7, 102).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, following the martyrdom many hundreds mourned the loss of two great men. None more so than their mother, Lucy Smith. As she viewed her dead sons lying before her, she is given, and in turn offers to us, these words of comfort and hope:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;As I looked upon their peaceful, smiling countenances, I seemed almost to hear them say; &lsquo;Mother, weep not for us, we have overcome the world by love; we carried to them the Gospel, that their souls might be saved; they slew us for our testimony, and thus placed us beyond their power; their ascendency is for a moment, ours is an eternal triumph&rsquo;&rdquo; (History of Joseph Smith by his Mother, Lucy Smith, 325).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My invitation to each of us today is to never forget the events herein described. To always hold in sacred remembrance the lives of Joseph and Hyrum Smith and the work to which they gave their lives. My invitation is that we may do as Parley P. Pratt envisioned when he said, regarding the prophet Joseph Smith:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has organized the kingdom of God. We will extend its dominion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has restored the fullness of the gospel. We will spread it abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has laid the foundation of Nauvoo. We will build it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has laid the foundation of the temple. We will build up the top-stone with shouting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had kindled a fire. We will fan the flame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has kindled up the dawn of a day of glory. We will bring it to meridian splendor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a &lsquo;little one&rsquo; and become a thousand. We are a small one, and will become a strong nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, he quarried the stone from the mountain; we will cause it to become a great mountain and fill the whole earth&rdquo; (Parley P. Pratt, Millennial Star 5:151-52).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we go forward as charged is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p>There is, in the Book of Mormon, a chapter that contains the words of an angel who was sent to King Benjamin prophesying the birth, ministry, and atoning sacrifice of Christ. It also explains the eternal purposes of his coming, which brings joy and peace to those who hear. He said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I intend to review with you some blessings of the Messiah&rsquo;s coming to the earth, and to testify of His promised blessings relative to our national freedom and freedom from captivity and death, both of the body and of the Spirit. I hope, by considering these blessings, your joy will increase, and that your faith in Christ will give you strength to live so you may be free.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>National Freedom</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love this land, this promised land established by God as the land of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. On this, the eve of another 4th&nbsp;of July celebration, I express my gratitude for the blessing of living here, in the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired and noble men, who had the courage to worship God and live his laws, prepared the way for us to live in this favored land, which God has established as a free and independent nation. Those men were inspired to establish a republic, which was founded upon belief in, and dependence upon, our Creator. They were sustained in that endeavor by their personal integrity, self-reliance, courage, and their will to press forward in difficult times, even at the peril of their lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has taken many years, much sacrifice, and a great deal of blood to establish a land free from all other nations, and protected from oligarchy and anarchy. God has preserved, and will continue to preserve this great nation as a land of liberty, if we serve Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are blessed to live in this republic; a democratic, political system that finds its rule of law rooted in harmony with the will of God. Democracy is essential in maintaining the integrity and stability of a republic. It allows the voice of the people, the citizens, to determine the influence and actions of their government. However, for a people to be secure and free in a democracy, its citizens must be governed by laws, which are just, and which are &ldquo;&hellip;administered for the good and safety of society.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Democracy, without the rule of just law and the equal application thereof, would stray into oligarchy, where an individual or group would control society unjustly. Or, it would collapse into anarchy, a chaotic society without law and order. There are guidelines in Doctrine and Covenants 134 about limitations to human law:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private devotion; [We believe]&hellip;that the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control conscience; should punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, during your Sunday School classes, the reading assignment included Chapter 29 of the Book of Mosiah. King Mosiah, the seer and son of Benjamin, the great Nephite king, defined some evils that stem from despotic, tyrannical and repressive governments or kingdoms.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;There he stressed the importance of the voice of the people saying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it happens, democracies are on a dangerous path when the voice of the people expresses opposition to the laws of God. Only by serving the God of this land, who is Jesus Christ, can we remain a people free from any other nation or power. Moroni, son of Mormon, who witnessed the entire destruction of the Nephite civilization, warned future generations of their responsibility of citizenship in this promised land. He wrote:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested by the things which we have written.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints continues to encourage us to participate in the political process, and to thoughtfully and prayerfully consider the choices we are making when we cast our ballots. We are justified by God to &ldquo;befriend that law which is constitutional&rdquo;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;and we are given to understand that true freedom results from obedience to law that is just and is applied with equality. The Lord has said, &ldquo;Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn. Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold . . ..&rdquo;<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of our freedom and the many blessings of heaven that have been poured out upon our land, we are envied of other nations. Of necessity, at this moment, there are many thousands of military personnel, many like you, primarily young men and women, including many members of the Church, who are enlisted in the Armed Forces to protect our heritage from attack by those who would destroy our freedoms, and take all that we hold dear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise, members of the Church are serving in the militaries of other nations. Our military might, given us by God, is a deterrent against aggressive nations. We owe much to those who are risking their lives for our benefit. Their lives are precious and yet, they are willing to sacrifice them to retain our freedom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill, an English economist and philosopher, wisely observed that our freedom is the result of the courage, bravery and sacrifice of others. He said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling, which thinks that nothing is worth war, is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing, which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scriptures testify that there are times when war is justified and that we must defend our homes, liberties, wives and children, and maintain our religion. The prophet Mormon wrote:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nephites were inspired by a better cause, for they were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed. Therefore for this cause were the Nephites contending with the Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their families, and their lands, their country, and their rights, and their religion.&rdquo;<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley explained: &ldquo;It is clear from these and other writings that there are times and circumstances when nations are justified, in fact have an obligation, to fight for family, for liberty, and against tyranny, threat, and oppression&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Our national freedom is conditional. We can only be secure as we give heed to the commandments and teachings of the Savior of the World. Our liberty is dependent upon righteousness, and only by His name, His power, and by doing his will.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Freedom from Death and Hell</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There is much variety in our mortal experience. There are struggles here: sorrow, pain, sickness, death, and opposition. There are those who are tall, short, thin, heavy, homely, and attractive. Some are born with serious deformities and limitations. Even so, we retain our agency and we may learn to be content with those things that we are allotted.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Our moral agency is not taken away&ndash;&ndash;we are free to choose truth or error, good or evil, light or darkness, captivity and death, or freedom and life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We find ourselves here on earth with physical bodies, enlivened by our spirits housed therein. &nbsp;Our memories of pre-mortal enthusiasm and commitments have become dim. Our agency is being given a perfect test.&nbsp; Each day our choices can limit or expand our freedom. We may choose dangerous activities for a thrill that could shorten our lives, eat or drink to ruin our health or to improve it. We may choose to use our time for selfish, forbidden activities that enslave our bodies and spirits, or we may choose to keep our covenants with God and feel his love. Alma taught that our actions are important:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at hand that all men shall reap a reward of their works, according to that which they have been&mdash;if they have been righteous they shall reap the salvation of their souls, according to the power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil they shall reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power and captivation of the devil.&rdquo;<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years ago, while working on a cattle ranch doing some work with a tractor, I happened to see what appeared to be a muskrat trap lying on the ground. I stopped the tractor and picked it up.&nbsp; The trap held firmly in its jaws the foot and leg of a great blue heron, held steadfastly by only one toe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I picked up the trap with its attached leg and couple of the feathers and placed them on the fence. It appeared as if someone, intending to trap a muskrat for its fur, or some other reason, had carefully set the trap under the grass and reeds in an irrigation canal. Innocently, the great blue heron had landed in the same location to obtain his daily ration of fish or frogs. While prodding through the grass and lilies, it found itself as a victim, caught by one toe with no possibility of escape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was apparent that this poor creature had struggled for some time, finally pulling the trap loose from its tethered stake. It then had flown over several fences until the weight of the attached trap and fatigue brought it to the ground. It looked as though it had then been attacked, killed, and eaten by other animals. The only evidence of this struggle that remains is what you see in my hands and on the screen. It had no power to escape the natural consequences of mortal life and death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In relating this event to our own lives, we realize that all mortal creatures are subject to death and the dissolution of the body. In considering captivity and death from a doctrinal perspective, please retain the image of the remains of this majestic bird in your mind to determine whether you will qualify for the blessings of salvation provided by our Savior Jesus Christ, through his merciful atonement. Lehi explains:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of us, by nature of our birth into mortality, must face the &ldquo;awful monster&rdquo; described by Nephi&rsquo;s brother, Jacob. His description of that monster is twofold: the death of the body and the death of the spirit, which Jacob describes as hell.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Freedom from Physical Death</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We realize that physical death is inevitable, and its finality causes us to anticipate it with trepidation. Without the resurrection of Christ, there is no salvation from physical death. Many modern Christian religions explain away the true doctrine of the resurrection denying that Jesus came forth from the tomb with spirit and element inseparably connected.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;They must do so to satisfy the 4th and 5th century creeds<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;that rose up from the minds of men to define God as three-in-one and one-in-three, having no physical body, parts, or passions. These are the creeds condemned by the Lord who said to the Prophet Joseph, that &ldquo;&hellip;all their creeds were an abomination in his sight&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is inconceivable to the scientific community, based upon empirical evidence, that the dead may come forth again in life; or that decomposed bodies of any earthly creature could have its life processes restored. So, our faith in the literal resurrection of Jesus can be a test. President Harold B. Lee said: &ldquo;Death of a loved one is the most severe test that you will ever face, and if you can rise above your grief and if you will trust in God, then you will be able to surmount any other difficulty with which you may be faced.&rdquo;<sup>21</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During Jesus&rsquo; mortal ministry, he taught that the dead would be taught by the voice of God saying: &ldquo;Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.&rdquo;<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With confidence and certitude, we testify about the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, and the forgiveness of sin more clearly than any people on earth. We are able to do so because prophets of God teach us. These true prophets of God have been taught true doctrines and principles by angels, and thus they know truths that cannot be known to the natural man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several years ago, I was home one evening while my wife was fulfilling an assignment with the young women of our ward. Our children were young, and I was left at home to complete some of the normal, household chores and get the children to bed. While standing at the sink, washing dishes, I was listening to the radio, tuned to station KOA in Denver, Colorado. The narrator introduced a kindly gentleman to the radio audience as a prominent minister of one of the large Protestant churches in the United States, stating that he was second in authority in that church, and that he would be glad to respond to religious questions from the listening audience. I listened to several questions and his answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was particularly interested in one caller who sounded like a college age young woman who asked a question about resurrection. She asked whether she would have a physical body when she was resurrected. She said that she had been studying one of the Eastern religions and had become curious about reincarnation, so was wondering how the Christian idea of resurrection compared. Would a resurrected person be able eat, drink, and experience physical activities&ndash;&ndash;things which she understood reincarnation would provide?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minister was kind, and it was evident that he really wanted to help her understand about the resurrection of the Savior. He answered, &ldquo;My dear, you will have a beautiful resurrected spiritual body like Christ had.&rdquo; She responded, &ldquo;Will I have a physical body and be able to eat food and drink water?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;You will receive a beautiful, resurrected, spiritual body.&rdquo; She again asked, &ldquo;Does that mean I won&rsquo;t have a physical body when I am resurrected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He replied kindly that her resurrected body would be a beautiful, immortal, spiritual body; the same as the resurrected body of Jesus. She sounded somewhat discouraged by his answer, and said, &ldquo;Well, okay then.&rdquo; And she ended the call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I decided that I would phone the radio station, and make an attempt to answer her question. I dialed the number. After a few moments, someone on the other end answered and said, &ldquo;Hold the line, please.&rdquo; I waited briefly and the minister answered, saying, &ldquo;You are on the air, what is your question?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t really have a question, but would like to comment for the benefit of the young lady who called, asking about a physical body and resurrection. I think that she understood, from your answer, that Jesus did not have a body of flesh and bone, following his resurrection. I have been reading a most interesting book that gives added information about this event, which may be helpful to her.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book states clearly, that following his resurrection in Jerusalem, Jesus visited people in ancient America, saying to them that &lsquo;He was Jesus Christ whom the prophets testified should come into the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He then asked them to come forward and feel the wounds in his hands and his feet that they could know that he had been slain for the sins of the world and that he had overcome death. This would clarify for her, that resurrection is not to receive a new or different body, as in reincarnation, but resurrection means that Jesus had, after he was resurrected, the same physical body which he had while fulfilling his ministry in Jerusalem, a body of flesh and bone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He asked, &ldquo;What is the book?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;The Book of Mormon.&rdquo; Well, his friendly and warm tone of voice became a little colder and he said, &ldquo;Oh, we can&rsquo;t believe anything in the Book of Mormon.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Do you have a Bible there, with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;We believe everything that is written in the Bible.&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you read a passage from the Bible about Jesus&rsquo; resurrection and his resurrected body?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sure, I will read anything from the Bible.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you. Would you please read Luke 24:36-43?&rdquo; He answered that he would. Then, I could hear pages turning, and he began to read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? And why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. And he took it, and did eat before them.&rdquo;<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading those verses, he was silent, so I said, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that sound to you as if he had a body of flesh and bone following his resurrection? He answered, &ldquo;You know, it really does!&rdquo; almost as if that idea had not occurred to him before. I then responded, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem possible, that his body, being a resurrected body of flesh and bone when he appeared to his apostles, would still be a resurrected body of flesh and bone now?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;No, he got rid of his body right after that, because he didn&rsquo;t need it any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was then disconnected. The line was dead, but I hoped that what had been said was enough that the young woman who had asked the question would look up the missionaries to learn more about Jesus appearing to the people of the ancient Americas as the resurrected Savior of the world. I believe this good minister really wanted to answer truthfully. He simply had not had access to the true doctrine of resurrection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How thankful I am that the Prophet Joseph Smith brought forth the Book of Mormon and the restoration of the gospel for, as is said in the Doctrine and Covenants, pertaining to the Restoration of the gospel:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By these things we know that there is a God in heaven&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, the Almighty God gave his Only Begotten Son&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was crucified, died, and rose again the third day&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ascended into heaven, to sit down on the right hand of the Father, to reign with almighty power according to the will of the Father&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma&rsquo;s missionary Companion, Amulek, teaching the doubting lawyer, Zeezrom, taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be raised from this temporal death. The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought to stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all our guilt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, &hellip;to be judged according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.&rdquo;<sup>26</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the teachings of true prophets of God, we know these things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally, Mormon gave us this beautiful testimony of the resurrection of Jesus following his crucifixion from the record of Nephi, the disciple of Christ:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying: Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.<sup>32</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.&rdquo;<sup>33</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, we can be free from physical death, but only by His name. This is a free gift, given to all mankind because of his great love. However, the glory obtained in the resurrection will depend upon our choices.<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Abinidi&rsquo;s final witness of the atonement emphasizes the important relationship of sin and the glory of resurrection:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation&hellip; Having gone according to their own carnal wills and desires; having never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were extended towards them; for the arms of mercy were extended towards them, and they would not; they being warned of their iniquities and yet they would not depart from them; and they were commanded to repent and yet they would not repent.&rdquo;<sup>35</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Freedom from Spiritual Death</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the death of the spirit? It is not so easily recognized. This death seems indefinable, and difficult to observe or describe. Alma expresses this process as a hardening of our hearts.<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;This change in our hearts is subtle because &ldquo;&hellip;the temptations of the devil blind our eyes and harden our hearts.&rdquo;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;Then, being tempted and not listening to, or heeding the feelings of our conscience, we justify our sins, and continue in them. We then become insensitive to the prompting of the spirit of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gradually, we know less and less of God and his mysteries, and we find ourselves bound in the &ldquo;chains of hell,&rdquo;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;and we continue as the &ldquo;natural man,&rdquo; carnal, sensual and devilish, becoming enemies to God. Indeed, we find ourselves trapped with no means of escape but by the redeeming power of Christ. Without repentance, our spiritual death is as certain and as final as the physical death of the blue heron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is his will that those who are poor in spirit come unto him<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;and all are invited, for he has said: &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&rdquo;<sup>40</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fearless prophet Abinidi described those who will not repent, saying: &ldquo;But remember that he that persists in his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state and the devil hath all power over him. Therefore he is as though there was no redemption made, being an enemy to God&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>41</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sin and captivity go hand in hand. God has said: &ldquo;Abide ye in the liberty wherewith ye are made free; entangle not yourselves in sin, but let your hands be clean, until the Lord comes.<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;Is it possible to escapes the penalties, entanglements, and captivity of sin? Is it possible to ever feel peace about our sins? Alma described the feelings of each accountable person who must stand before God to be judged as to whether their choices were good or evil. Our sins may not be the magnitude of his sins; nevertheless, our sins may have been sufficiently serious that we have tasted the pain and sorrow of which he spoke. He said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yea&hellip;and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.&rdquo;<sup>43</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even Nephi, the son of Lehi, felt sorrow over some of his choices when he lamented:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.&rdquo;<sup>44</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, entanglements of sin are not often reversible, and are the source of much regret and sorrow during our lives. They are likely to cause pain and anguish to those we love or have offended. There may be irreversible consequences to some of our actions, but the penalties of sin, which are required by Justice, can be satisfied by the Savior&rsquo;s atonement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some years ago, while serving as bishop, I was approached by an elderly man in our ward, an ordinance worker in a nearby temple.&nbsp; He was a faithful priesthood holder, and had been such for many years. When he was seated in the office, he began to weep. I will not soon forget in my mind this good man, his hands crippled with arthritis, the pain in his face, his occasional sobs, as he sought for the words he to needed speak. After a couple of minutes, he said that he finally had enough courage to speak about an event in his life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He began by saying that when he was seventeen years old, he had broken the law of chastity. He was young and he had friends who had done the same thing, so he then felt like it was no big deal. However, as time passed, he retained a vivid memory of the event and he could find no peace in his soul. He kept thinking that these troubled feelings would go away, and that it would not be long before he forgot about it. But this was not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As years passed he received temple recommends, during each interview, when asked about being morally clean, he would answer that he was worthy, thinking that he had not repeated the act, and that it was far in the past, and did not need to be mentioned. In his sorrow, he said that this event, and his failure to come to terms with it, had stopped his progress in the Church. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He feared it had stopped him from being more successful in his life&rsquo;s work. He lacked confidence in leading his children, he felt untrue to his wife and felt undeserving of the blessings of heaven. Some 65 years had passed since the sin had occurred, and it was still tormenting his soul, and finally he was doing as was required by God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watching the Spirit of the Lord come upon this man, as he spoke honestly, in humility, in shame, and deep sorrow, was a wonderful witness of the power of the atonement of Jesus Christ. It was a visible fulfillment of the promised blessing of peace that comes with repentance; freedom from the shackles and captivity of sin. An enormous and weighty burden was moved from his shoulders. He had received the image of Christ in his countenance.<sup>45</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He left the office with a beautiful smile on his face, a lighter step, and peace in his heart. He had been faithful for many years, but the Lord did not grant the peace to him until he had met the requirements of repentance, to confess and forsake his sins. He had finally come to get help to be free from the trap and bondage that had held him fast for these many years. All that is required by our Redeemer is described in the Doctrine and Covenants: &ldquo;Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more. By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins&mdash;behold, he will confess them and forsake them.&rdquo;<sup>46</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must identify our sins, and by our faith in Christ, repent of them. We must confess our sins voluntarily. Forced confession does not indicate a broken heart and contrite spirit. All sins must be confessed to God. Those that would affect our membership or good standing in the Church must be confessed to an ecclesiastical leader, a judge in Israel. We must forsake our sins by keeping our baptismal covenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our escape from spiritual death is also freely given, but with conditions, given because of the love of the Savior to satisfy the demands of justice, which our sins have incurred. This freedom cannot be granted to us unless we qualify to have the Son of God plead with his Father that his blood may be applied to our sins.<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;To qualify, we must be born again. Every person must repent, be redeemed of the Lord, and born of the Spirit.<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;There must be a mighty change of heart in us that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.<sup>49</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles emphasized that our past does not just disappear, he said: &ldquo;I realized once again that things do not get swept under the rug in the eternal economy of things. Sins do not take care of themselves, or simply fade away, they must be dealt with.<sup>50</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Neil L. Anderson<strong> </strong>of the Twelve has said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes we wonder why we remember our sins long after we have forsaken them&hellip; The forsaking of sins implies never returning. Forsaking requires time. To help us, the Lord at times allows the residue of our mistakes to rest in our memory. It is a vital part of our mortal learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we honestly confess our sins, restore what we can to the offended, and forsake our sins by keeping the commandments, we are in the process of receiving forgiveness. With time, we will feel the anguish of our sorrow subside, taking &lsquo;away the guilt from our hearts&rsquo; and bringing &lsquo;peace of conscience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For those who are truly repentant but seem unable to feel relief: continue keeping the commandments. I promise you, relief will come in the timetable of the Lord. Healing also requires time. If you are concerned, counsel with your bishop. A bishop has the power of discernment. He will help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scriptures warn us, &lsquo;Do not procrastinate the day of your repentance.&rsquo; But, in this life, it is never too late to repent.&rdquo;<sup>51</sup></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Surely, there &ldquo;&hellip;shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.&rdquo;<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;To which I gratefully testify, thanking Him for our freedom from oppression, death, and the torments of sin. May each of us stand fast in the defense of freedom and agency, may we have peace about the process of life, death and resurrection, and may we find joy in confessing and forsaking our sins, that the Lord&rsquo;s atoning sacrifice may heal us and remove the traps of bondage and misery from our lives.</p>

<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I am so very pleased to be with you today. I always appreciate the prayers of those who open our devotionals, and especially today, I am particularly in need of your prayers today. The music is always so inspiring, those that perform always sound as if there is a choir of angels singing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the time construction started in 2006 on this facility I have stood in this location many times looking out over this area that is now finished. I imagined how wonderful the day would be when the project would be complete; when students, faculty, and staff would gather for devotional and other great events to be held in this facility. It has been exciting to be involved with the construction of this facility, to attend the dedication of this facility, and to come to devotionals over the past 18 months, but for some reason it is not as exciting for me today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the topic that I have chosen to speak on today is the power of prayer. I will always be grateful to my mother&ndash;&ndash;who is with us today&ndash;&ndash;for teaching me as young child to pray; not only to pray, but to pray daily. Prayer was always a priority in our home as I was growing up.&nbsp; My parents always ensured that we gathered for family prayer everyday. Many of the things that were included our family prayer were gratitude for the gospel, family, and the ability to work and provide for our needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first day on the job at BYU-Idaho, which at that time was Ricks College, Chuck Frost introduced me to my staff and called on one to offer a prayer to start our meeting. Having worked in the corporate sector for many years prior to coming to BYU-Idaho, I was pleasantly surprised to know that meetings start and end with prayer at this great institution. Brothers and sisters, it may seem foreign to think that we pray about design and construction projects, facilities management issues, security and safety issues, and what the campus may need as part of its physical makeup, but it is wonderful to know all things on this campus are directed by the Lord through many prayers in all areas of this institution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is truly power in prayer. The Savior instructed the Nephites to watch and pray always. This instruction is for our benefit today also. 3 Nephi 18:18-21 gives us instruction, a warning, and a beautiful promise:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The instruction given is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The warning given is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The promises given are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years as we have raised our family, I have found great comfort in these scriptures. Verse 21 instructs us &ldquo;Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.&rdquo; One of our family members was struggling in their teenage years. I was very concerned and looking for direction. I remember clearly pondering this concern one night while I was driving home from work. I decided to call my parents for some counsel and advice. I asked them, &ldquo;What did you do when I was struggling in my teenage years?&rdquo; I was surprised by the answer, &ldquo;The only thing we could do: we prayed for you.&rdquo; I am so grateful for their prayers, and as we have talked with our children they have expressed their appreciation for our prayers for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you are pondering starting a family or are in the early stages of beginning your families. Please read 3 Nephi 18:18-21 and consider the instruction given as you start this next phase of your life. There is great instruction given and great blessings promised in these verses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book of Alma has so many great examples of instruction to us about prayer, faith, fasting, and the purpose of the Atonement. Alma teaches us mightily about faith and prayer. I love Alma and I love his instruction to us. In chapter 37 as Alma was turning the plates over to his son Helaman to keep a record of his people, Alma gave Helaman great instruction in verse 21. Alma counsels Helaman to be diligent in keeping the commandments as they are written. If we are faithful in keeping the commandments with diligence, we have prepared ourselves to hear the word of the Lord when he instructs us as we pray. Alma again instructs Helaman to keep the commandments in verse 35. Then in verse 36 and 37, Alma instructs Helaman to pray for his support in all things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The promise given in verse 37 gives us great hope &ldquo;and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.&rdquo; Brothers and sisters, as you continue in your education do as we are instructed in these verses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be prayerful and listen carefully as you apply for employment and make critical decisions for your family. If you pray for guidance at this time of your life, the Lord will guide you in all things that are necessary for your wellbeing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Alma 34:17-29, Amulek teaches us that the eternal plan of redemption is based on faith and repentance and that we need to pray for temporal and spiritual blessings. He gives us great instruction that we need to be humble and continue to pray. We are also instructed what to pray for, how and where we should pray, for whom we should pray, and what we need to do once we have prayed. Please listen to these verses of scripture and ponder the instruction given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need&mdash;I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My father was an example in his life and my mother still is an example of these scriptures to our family. They always prayed as instructed in these scriptures. They have always prayed for our family. They prayed that their business would prosper so they could provide for their family and they have always been charitable to those in need. They have been a great example of these principles to our family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that each one of us can be humble, continue in prayer, cry unto the Lord in our homes, morning, midday, and evening, for our welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around us. The Lord knows each one of us personally. He is very mindful of our needs. He will hear and answer our prayers if we remember to ask in our times of need. Even when we ask for the simplest things, he will hear our prayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years ago, when I was a Young Men president, there was a family that lived near our home with a son who was struggling. I had the opportunity to invite this young man to go boating with us. We spent several hours on the lake that day and we skied until the sun went down that evening.&nbsp;The boat ramp was several miles from where we were skiing and we were running low on gas. The night was very dark. We were using a spot light to find our way back to the boat ramp when the boat ran out of gas. The first thing that came to mind was it is going to be a very long night on this lake. As we talked about our options that were very limited we decided to pray for help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We finished the prayer then sat quietly in the boat. After a short period of time that seemed long that night, we heard the sound of a small fishing boat coming toward us. We used our spotlight to get the fisherman&rsquo;s attention. We explained our situation and he offered to go the boat ramp to get a five-gallon can of gas he had in his truck. The Lord was mindful of our needs that night and our prayers were answered along with an opportunity to teach this young man and some of our family members the power of prayer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord hears the simplest prayers. The gospel was restored because of the faith of Joseph Smith and his sincere prayer at age 14 after he had read James 1:5: &ldquo;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a great promise in this scripture. If we will simply ask in faith for those things that are right it shall be given. I am sure many here today can tell a story of how a simple and sincere prayer was answered. Many years ago in Adelaide, Australia, a young mother, Sister Pat Hedger, was widowed at the age of 28&ndash;&ndash;left to raise 3 young children. Pat was employed as an office assistant for the South Australia Police Department and was struggling with the death of her husband. A lady in the office knew of Pat&rsquo;s situation. She asked Pat if she had ever prayed for help. Pat had grown up in a home that was not necessarily active in their religion and had never learned to pray. Pat&rsquo;s friend taught her how to offer a simple prayer and to ask for comfort. Pat found comfort in prayer. A simple prayer softened her heart and prepared her to accept the gospel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About eight years after Pat had learned to pray, my companion and I knocked on her door. She was busy, so we left her a copy of the Book of Mormon and set up a return appointment. When we returned to teach Pat she related her story to us. As we taught her the first discussion, we shared the Joseph Smith story with her and she related her personal experience with prayer. We asked Pat if she would offer a prayer before we left her home that night. She accepted and offered a very simple but sincere prayer. We set another appointment for the following evening to share the plan of salvation. Because of that simple prayer she offered years before she was prepared to recognize the truth of the Book of Mormon, she was baptized a week later. Pat&rsquo;s two sons were baptized the following month and her daughter was baptized several months later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of a simple prayer, a family was prepared to accept the gospel. Since that time Pat served in many callings, her sons Brenton and Darrell served missions, and her daughter Julie has served in the Young Women and many other callings faithfully. About seven years ago I received an email from Pat&rsquo;s son, Brenton. He had just been called to serve as a bishop and now serves on the Adelaide North Stake High Council. Through a simple prayer a young family was prepared to hear and accept the gospel and now has the opportunity for eternal life. The Hedger family continues to serve and loves the Lord because of a mother&rsquo;s simple prayer in a time of need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the dedication of the Kirtland Temple the Lord gave the Saints great instruction about prayer and fasting. Although the Lord was talking about his temple in these scriptures, we can learn a great lesson of how we should establish our homes as place of prayer and fasting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom, seek learning even by study and also by faith;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing, and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That your incomings may be in the name of the Lord, that your outgoings may be in the name of the Lord, that all your salutations may be in the name of the Lord, with uplifted hands unto the Most High&rdquo; (D&amp;C 109: 7-8).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This instruction sounds familiar doesn&rsquo;t it? The Learning Model is such a great example of the principles taught in these scriptures of how we should approach many things in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma and the sons of Mosiah had a great understanding of these principles and how we are to prepare ourselves to be servants of the Lord, prepare ourselves for our careers, prepare ourselves to lead our families, and have great success in the gospel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land of Gideon southward, away to the land of Manti, behold, to his astonishment, he met with the sons of Mosiah journeying towards the land of Zarahemla.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God&rdquo; (Alma 17:1-3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wonderful wife and I have taken the opportunity many times throughout our marriage to call upon the Lord for special help through prayer and fasting&ndash;&ndash;when our sons were serving in the mission field, when our daughter has come up against challenges, when our extended families have had challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a great opportunity in our home to participate in special time of prayer and fasting with our children 11 years ago as my older brother was fighting for his life. He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and if any of you know about this type of cancer, it is normally fatal. We invited our children to participate in a full fast for my brother. I am not sure, but I believe this was the first time all of our children together had participated in a full 24-hour fast as a family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We opened this fast together as a family with a very sincere prayer in behalf of my brother. This fast has been an anchor in our family as to the power of prayer and fasting and has helped strengthen the faith of our entire family. Today my brother is still alive and is doing well. We consider this a miracle provided to our family through faith, prayer, and fasting. The Lord is very aware of each of us individually. He hears and answers our prayers as we ask in faith, and in his name. Ensure as you establish your home and family that you do as we are instructed in Doctrine and Covenants and in Alma. I have a strong testimony of how the Lord will bless us as we ask in faith, prayer, and fasting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While serving as President of BYU-Idaho, Elder David A. Bednar was invited to speak at a devotional at BYU. His topic was the Atonement and the Journey of Mortality. This talk was printed in the Ensign this past April and I would highly recommend you review it. Elder Bednar stated, &ldquo;The journey of mortality is to go from bad to good to better and to have our very natures changed.&rdquo; Elder Bednar noted the Book of Mormon has many examples of those who were transformed by the enabling power of the Atonement through prayer. As members of the Church we are generally familiar with the cleansing power of the Atonement, but Elder Bednar teaches us so eloquently about the enabling power of the Atonement through prayer. One example he shared was how Nephi understood the enabling power of the Savior:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nephi is an example of one who knew, understood, and relied upon the enabling power of the Savior. Recall that the sons of Lehi had returned to Jerusalem to enlist Ishmael and his household in their cause. Laman and others in the party traveling with Nephi from Jerusalem back to the wilderness rebelled, and Nephi exhorted his brethren to have faith in the Lord. It was at this point in their journey that Nephi&rsquo;s brothers bound him with cords and planned his destruction. Please note Nephi&rsquo;s prayer: &lsquo;O Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst these bands with which I am bound&rsquo; (1 Nephi 7:17; emphasis added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I likely would have prayed for if I had been tied up by my brothers? &lsquo;Please get me out of this mess NOW!&rsquo; It is especially interesting to me that Nephi did not pray to have his circumstances changed. Rather, he prayed for the strength to change his circumstances. And I believe he prayed in this manner precisely because he knew, understood, and had experienced the enabling power of the Atonement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Bednar helped me better understand that we should not ask the Lord to fix our problems, but ask for the Lord&rsquo;s help to change our circumstances through faith and obedience to the commandments. Elder Bednar has given great instruction in the following quote:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The implication of this episode for each of us is straightforward. As you and I come to understand and employ the enabling power of the Atonement in our personal lives, we will pray and seek for strength to change our circumstances rather than praying for our circumstances to be changed. We will become agents who act rather than objects that are acted upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is my prayer that as you go forward from this university you will better understand the importance of a strong relationship with your Savior through prayer. Take time each day, morning and night, to pray to your Heavenly Father, have a prayer in your heart throughout the day, and be obedient in all things so that the Lord may bless you. Pray for help in your education, and for assistance in taking care of your personal needs. As you establish families, pray for the Lord&rsquo;s continued help in providing for them, and as we are taught in 3 Nephi 18, pray in your families unto the Father, in the name of Christ, that your wives and your children may be blessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is my sincere testimony that there is great power in prayer. I have seen and continue to see great blessing poured out upon our family because of faith, prayer, and fasting. The Lord loves each of you and is waiting to pour his blessing upon you as you are faithful and obedient. This is my testimony and I leave this with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>I am honored to be here this evening and express appreciation for this wonderful assignment. I bring you the love and congratulations of President Monson, the First Presidency, and the Quorum of the Twelve. You are blessed to have President Kim Clark as president of this great institution. No, he is not a relative. My reputation would improve if he was. He is a great man with much experience to share with you, and I hope you have learned a great deal from him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mary Anne and I lived in Guatemala for five years. Elder Richard G. Scott visited while we were there and we toured El Salvador and Panama. On a Friday evening we had a devotional in Panama. We arrived about 6:30 pm and the devotional was scheduled for 7:00 pm. As we were entering the building and walking down the corridor, I looked into one of the classrooms and a little boy was on his knees praying.&nbsp; I felt that I was on sacred ground and I shut the door. We went on to the Chapel and shortly thereafter the little boy entered and sat behind us. We had a wonderful devotional with Elder Scott, and as the devotional ended I approached the little boy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was our conversation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Carlos Pitti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you here with your parents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No, I am here with my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why were you praying in the classroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I was praying that I would feel the spirit during the devotional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Did you feel the spirit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As tears ran down his cheeks from his big brown eyes, he said, &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope and pray that like Carlos, you have prayed that you will feel the spirit during our time together. The Holy Ghost will teach you if you have come prepared, like my friend Carlos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being in Rexburg is like being home. I grew up on Center Street, one half block from BYU-Idaho. In those days there were only three buildings, the Kirkham Auditorium and two old rock buildings, which have long since been torn down. There was only a field of sagebrush and we chased rabbits where most of the buildings are today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even remember when Ricks College, now BYU-Idaho, was so small that they were thinking of moving the college to another location! We were thrilled to have it remain close to our home on Center Street! Oh how the campus has changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attended Ricks College and graduated, then went on to BYU and Washington State University where I received my MBA. It was in Rexburg that I was instructed and influenced by my parents, my blind grandfather, Alma Benjamin Larsen, who was a patriarch, family, friends, teachers, and leaders. It was on this hill that I saw the prophet of God in person for the first time, President David O. McKay. When I saw him I knew he was a prophet. There are so many memories. For me life all started here in Rexburg. For you, in a way, it will start here. You have been influenced by friends, professors, leaders, and many others. For you and me, I would like to express our appreciation for their great influence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today is about you and your future. Don&rsquo;t look at today as the end, but look at it as the beginning. I have looked at the information about you. You are all different, but in a more important way, you are the same. You are children of God with divine potential to become all you ever dreamed you could be.&nbsp; What you have and will become is more important than what you learned here at BYU-Idaho. You have been preparing to be disciples of the Savior and leaders in your home, the Church, and the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This evening I would like to talk about the law of the harvest that can help you fulfill your dreams.</p>
<p>In Galatians, we are taught the law of the harvest:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>William George Jordan in the book &ldquo;The Kingship of Self-Control,&rdquo; said it this way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Man has two creators&ndash;his god and himself. His first creator furnishes him the raw material of his life and the laws in conformity with which he can make that life what he will. His second creator, himself, has marvelous powers he rarely realizes. It is what a man makes of himself that counts.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em><sup>2</sup></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t plant good seeds, we cannot expect a bountiful harvest. If you decide now to be the best you can be, in all that you do, and reach for the stars, so to speak, your harvest will be plentiful indeed. As you begin on this part of life&rsquo;s journey I would like to talk about five seeds that if planted and nourished will provide a bountiful harvest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The First Seed is Learning to Love Work</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi learned at a very young age the importance of work. Some of his great efforts included his return to Jerusalem to obtain the brass plates and the building of a ship when it was considered impossible. In first Nephi we read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.&rdquo; <sup>3</sup></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My father was a brick layer, and at the age of 11 or 12, I was a &ldquo;hod carrier.&rdquo; For those that do not know what a hod carrier is, he is the one that does all the menial tasks for a brick layer. One of the great things that my father taught me was how to work. If I wanted clothes, I worked for them. I bought my own car, and I put myself through college, because if I didn&rsquo;t do that, I would not have a college education. My father helped me to achieve my goals by showing me how to work when I was very young. If you have learned the value of hard work, you have certainly learned one of the most powerful of life&rsquo;s lessons of success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several years ago, I learned the results of a survey about the joy of work. The results were this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where would your answer fall in this survey? Do you love to work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mary Anne and I have six children. One of our daughters, Debbie, who is here this evening, was an All American High School Track Runner. I helped coach her. I taught her that first you run with your heart, then you run with your head and last of all you run with your feet. I am sure that many could run faster than Debbie, but they didn&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life and work are a lot like running. First of all it starts in your heart. You must have a desire to work hard.&nbsp; What is recorded in your heart no one can change. Second, you must work with your mind. When we work with our minds it is never boring. I have often said that if my job was to empty the garbage I would do it in one half of the time that it took the guy before me. You can become creative, and find new ways to make your job better. Finally you must work with your feet. These days those who work the hardest are the ones who will get a job and keep it. Life is very competitive and those with strong work ethics become the winners, or the ones who get the jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants, Section 4, teaches these same principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.&rdquo;<sup> 4</sup></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is obvious when one doesn&rsquo;t like his job because he will waste time, not be productive, and be the first to leave. A great worker is diligent. As we strive to be like Nephi, we will come to know that diligence is more important than intelligence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are going into a world where many are unemployed. You may have heard or will hear, &ldquo;There are no jobs.&rdquo; I would propose that there are always some people working. The question is, will you be the one that has a job? If you have a strong desire to work and are qualified, you can find a job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will suggest one way to get a job. You need to find a place where people are working and you meet the qualifications. Upon finding people working, ask to talk to the boss. The conversation may go something like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unconventional idea of working for free can help you achieve your goal of getting a job.&nbsp; It is better to work for free than not to be working. Many people I know have tried this technique. If you are the best, arriving early and leaving late, after a short period of time you may have a job. In one case they released three workers and my friend received a full time job doing the work of three people. What is your reputation as a doer and worker? How strong is your desire and love for work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Second Seed is that of Setting Challenging Goals</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Proverbs we read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.&rdquo;<sup> 5</sup></em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Once an individual has a vision, that vision is achieved by setting and achieving challenging goals. To quote Elder M. Russell Ballard,</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am so thoroughly convinced that if we don&rsquo;t set goals in our life and learn how to master the techniques of living to reach our goals, we can reach a ripe old age and look back on our life only to see that we reached but a small part of our full potential.&nbsp; When one learns to master the principles of setting a goal, he will then be able to make a great difference in the results he attains in this life.&rdquo; <sup>6</sup></em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As stated by Elder Ballard, goals alone are insufficient. We must live and plan to reach our goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One time, where I was working I had a goal to save 10 times my annual salary. I knew that if I saved the company that much money I would always have work. As part of achieving that goal I had an idea that would save the company I was working for $150,000. I knew that it was a great idea, but it was a completely new idea, and I knew that it might not be accepted easily. I presented the idea it was turned down. I worked on it, presented it again, and it was turned down again. The more I worked on it, and the more I researched it, I was sure about it, so I presented it five times. It was finally accepted. My boss was thrilled with the results, because it made him look good. That happened many years ago. The approval of that idea has resulted in savings of millions of dollars for that company. The achievement of challenging goals will not come easily. It will require dedication and persistence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is your vision? How much can you accomplish? The answer to this question is much more than you ever dreamed. You need to learn to think outside the box. Don&rsquo;t let others tell you it cannot be done. If you work hard at your job, and enjoy it, and set challenging goals, then through hard work achieve them, you will be the one who keeps his job. As President Boyd K. Packer has stated, &ldquo;You get what you go for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Third Seed is that of Service</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In the book of John is recorded a conversation between the Savior and Peter:</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</em></p>
<p><em>He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</em></p>
<p><em>He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.&rdquo; <sup>7</sup></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Service to others makes us better. As Peter was instructed, the world has a great need for people that know how to help others become better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Monson is the perfect example of reaching out to the one and serving others. President Packer said this about President Monson:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;He is more Christlike than the rest of us.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s known for emphasizing and elevating things that are most important, the ordinary things.&nbsp; He is the one for whom the widow and the orphan are not just statements in a book.&rdquo; <sup>8</sup></em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>When I was a mission president, I taught the great value of service. Sometimes missionaries would come to me and be unhappy, or want to go home. I often found that what they needed most was to get into their work as a missionary. As they learned to love the people they were teaching, they learned to serve them.&nbsp; As we learn to serve others, we forget ourselves, and enjoy life a lot more. It is when we think only about ourselves that we become unhappy. Get to work! Serve those around you! It will bring you much joy and much peace!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a favorite poem that illustrates the value of our influence and service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>The Touch of the Master's Hand</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>
<p>'Twas battered and scarred,</p>
<p>And the auctioneer thought it</p>
<p>scarcely worthwhile</p>
<p>To waste much time on the old violin,</p>
<p>but he held it up with a smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What am I bid, good folks", he cried,</p>
<p>"Who&rsquo;ll start the bidding for me?"</p>
<p>"One dollar, one dollar, then two, only two?"</p>
<p>"Two dollars, who&rsquo;ll make it three?"</p>
<p>"Three dollars once, three dollars twice, going and gone said he."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, No,</p>
<p>From the room far back a gray haired man</p>
<p>Came forward and picked up the bow,</p>
<p>Then wiping the dust from the old violin,</p>
<p>And tightening up the strings,</p>
<p>He played a melody, pure and sweet</p>
<p>As sweet as the angel sings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The music ceased and the auctioneer,</p>
<p>With a voice that was quiet and low,</p>
<p>Said "What am I bid for the old violin?"</p>
<p>As he held it up with the bow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A thousand, and who&rsquo;ll make it two?"</p>
<p>"Two thousand, and who&rsquo;ll make it three?"</p>
<p>"Three thousand once, three thousand twice,</p>
<p>Going and gone!" said he.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The people cheered,</p>
<p>But some of them cried,</p>
<p>"We do not quite understand."</p>
<p>"What changed its' worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man replied,</p>
<p>"The Touch of the Master&rsquo;s Hand."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And many a man with life out of tune,</p>
<p>All battered and torn with sin,</p>
<p>Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,</p>
<p>Much like that old violin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mess of pottage, a glass of wine,</p>
<p>A game and he travels on.</p>
<p>He is going once, he is going twice,</p>
<p>He is going and almost gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the Master comes,</p>
<p>And the foolish crowd never can quite understand,</p>
<p>The worth of a soul and the change that is wrought</p>
<p>By the Touch of the Masters' Hand. <sup>9 </sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we have the touch of the master&rsquo;s hand and help others become better through our service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Fourth Seed is that of Being Hungry to Learn</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We read in Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence. <sup>10</sup></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam Walton, the founder of WalMart, was always interested in learning from others. I knew Sam Walton and was impressed that he felt that everyone could teach him something even though he was one of the richest men in the United States. Maybe that is why he came to be one of the wealthiest. He lived simply and ran his business on a shoestring, but always knew there was a better way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example of this is President Gordon B. Hinckley. During his many years in the presidency of the Church he focused on achieving spiritual heights and improving many of the programs of the Church. He loved new ideas and took many of them to the Lord. The Church grew much stronger as he focused on better ways to strengthen the Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these wonderful changes included the Perpetual Education Fund, small temples and the Conference Center. President Thomas S. Monson continues that prophetic direction today. A great example of finding better ways of doing something is the example of the Pioneers traveling from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Pioneers traveled from Nauvoo to Salt Lake City it took several months to get there. With the stagecoach it took weeks to travel the same distance. With the invention of the railroad the time was reduced to days, and now we can travel by airplane in 2 to 3 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who are hungry to learn know that there is always a better way. We as members of the Church of Jesus Christ have a great advantage, the gift of the Holy Ghost. He knows all and cares about the spiritual, the temporal, the family, and all aspects of our lives. He helps us learn how to do things better.&nbsp; He whispers to us and he helps us many times every single day if we will listen to him. I have a little book of inspiration. It doesn&rsquo;t look like much, but is very useful to me. I have learned that the Holy Ghost talks to me. If I write my thoughts down and do them, He keeps talking to me. If we don&rsquo;t listen to Him, He will quit talking to us. We must be hungry to learn, and our very best teacher is the Holy Ghost. Studying the scriptures is a great way to receive revelation. That is one reason why we have them and study them daily. They will teach us where to go and what to do, in all aspects of our daily lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Fifth Seed is that of Solving Problems</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Doctrine and Covenants teaches how to solve problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.&nbsp; <sup>11</sup></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>When I was a young bishop in Saint Louis Missouri, we had six children and I was the head of a company. There were many successful people in our ward, including the stake president, many stake leaders and successful business people. I remember thinking, &ldquo;If my life was just like so and so, life would be perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mary Anne will always remember the night I came home and said, &ldquo;Now that I know many of the problems of the ward, I don&rsquo;t want to change places with anyone.&rdquo; I came to realize that everyone has challenges. It is how we approach the challenges and go about solving them that makes the difference and helps us learn to become better. The solutions are not easy and do not always result in the problem disappearing, but we can do something and usually things will improve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must study the problem out in our minds, pray about it, and listen for the personal revelation Heavenly Father is ready to give us. As we work out our problems, in faith and in prayer we will find the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My motto has become &ldquo;love problems, love life!&rdquo; The world needs problem solvers. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that, this is just the way I am,&rdquo; is another common statement. We can solve problems. As we become more like the Savior and our Father in Heaven we will become better problem solvers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The seeds of:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If planted, will help us in all aspects of our life. It will provide a bountiful harvest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May the blessings of heaven be with you and your families as you leave this great institution. I once again congratulate you. I want to testify to you, that as you listen to the Holy Ghost, as you have been instructed today by President Clark, he will guide you. I testify that Thomas S. Monson is God&rsquo;s prophet on the earth today. I have watched, I have listened, I have felt, I know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that Joseph Smith saw God the Father and the Son in the sacred grove many years ago. One day it was October; October in the east is beautiful. I was there alone, I knelt, I prayed, I know that Joseph saw the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that the Book of Mormon is true, and as you will sup from its pages, it will guide you and direct you. But most of all I know that the Savior lives, that Jesus is the Christ. That his atonement works in our lives, and only though him can we return to the presence of the Father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May God bless you on this very important day in your life is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>Before I offer a few remarks to the graduates, I would like to say a word to the parents. Thank you for entrusting your children to us. We love them very much. As I look at you today, I think of all the prayers you have said on behalf of your children. I think of all the home evenings and family dinners. &nbsp;I think of all the times you sat up waiting for them to come home. I think of your devotion to them and your love for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to tell you something about your children. One of the most wonderful things about your children is the light in their eyes and the love of the Savior in their hearts. These are priceless spiritual gifts. Your children have worked hard at BYU-Idaho. They have qualified for the blessings of increased faith, testimony, knowledge, and skills that will be of great value to them and their families and to the kingdom of God. They have become disciples of Jesus Christ. The Lord will send them on His errands in a world in turmoil, and the Holy Ghost will go with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I speak to the graduates. My dear brothers and sisters, I love you very much. I want to share with you today words of counsel from the Prophet Joseph Smith. I hope you will always remember these words of the Prophet as you face the many wonderful opportunities and the many challenges that will come to you in the years ahead. I quote from a message given to Brigham Young by the Prophet Joseph three years after the Prophet was martyred:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the people to be humble and faithful and sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. &nbsp;Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach [you what] to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom. Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them, their hearts will be ready to receive it. They can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits. It will whisper peace and joy to their souls, and it will take malice, hatred, envying, strife, and all evil from their hearts; and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness, and build up the kingdom of God. Tell the brethren if they will follow the Spirit of the Lord they will go right.&rdquo; (Teachings of the Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith, (2007), 98)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I say to you tonight, go forward unafraid with confidence and trust in the Lord. Always keep your covenants so that you will have the Holy Ghost with you. Never do anything, say anything, wear anything, watch anything, or go anywhere that would offend the Spirit and deprive you of the guidance and power of the Holy Ghost. If you follow the Prophet&rsquo;s counsel, you and your family will enjoy the blessings of heaven. When you come face-to-face with the opportunities and challenges of life, the Savior will be with you. He will bless you with spiritual strength and guidance through the power of the Holy Ghost. The Savior has been preparing you for a long time for just this time and season. &nbsp;Here is His promise to you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;... I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.&rdquo; (D&amp;C 84:88)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear witness to you, my dear brothers and sisters, that this scripture is true. God our Father lives and loves us. His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the Savior and Redeemer. I have seen His light. I know His power. I have felt His love. I know He lives. His church and kingdom have been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith never to be taken from the earth again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We send you out into the world tonight with our love, our confidence, and our trust. You have a great work to do in the kingdom. I know that if you will live to be worthy of the Holy Ghost, the light and power and redeeming love of Jesus Christ will be in your eyes and in your hearts and in your lives forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I so testify, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful to join with you for BYU&ndash;Idaho 2012 Education Week. I pray that the blessings of heaven may rest upon us as we meet together for a few minutes this afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have seen the remarkable poster that has been used to publicize Education Week. I found it particularly beautiful and meaningful. In the background the magnificent Rexburg Idaho Temple beckons, with dark clouds in the distance signaling a summer rainstorm may lie ahead. The foreground shows children and teenagers or young adults, perhaps parents, walking toward the temple through a wheat field that has recently been harvested. Some walk hand in hand. A few walk alone. Each carries a small bundle or sheaf of wheat. They don&rsquo;t appear to hurry, but neither do they appear to wander. They all walk a direct path toward the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pure children walking toward the temple, who gather like sheaves the good around them, are the heart of my message. Those children live in our homes. It is our divine privilege and responsibility to help them recognize the eternal truth that surrounds them, be worthy to enter the temple, and chart a lifelong course that will &ldquo;keep them in the right way.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am struck, as you likely have been as well, by one of the implicit messages in the Book of Mormon. Among many other things, the Book of Mormon is a chronicle of families. From Lehi and Sariah to Mormon and Moroni, we read about marriages, parents, children, siblings, grandchildren, and daughters and sons-in-law. Some of the accounts tell of people who were exceedingly good, the Nephis, Helamans, and Moronis of the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other characters from the Book of Mormon remind us that even in the best homes, things sometimes can go quite badly. For example, Lehi and Sariah were caused much heartache by some of their children. King Mosiah and his wife, and Alma Sr. and his wife, raised sons who must have caused them great concern and sorrow as their sons went about seeking to destroy the Church.&nbsp;The sons of Mosiah and Alma the younger eventually came to themselves and returned to the path, but they had given their parents great grief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, then, we find Lehi&rsquo;s dream recorded in the first pages of the Book of Mormon. It has much to do with families. You remember the account: Lehi beheld in a dream or vision &ldquo;a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.&rdquo;&nbsp;He went forth and partook of the fruit, and learned that it was &ldquo;most sweet, above all that [he] ever before tasted.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;[It] filled [his] soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore [he] began to be desirous that [his] family should partake of it also; for [he] knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After tasting the fruit and learning that it was delicious to his soul, he looked and saw Sariah, Sam, and Nephi, and &ldquo;they stood as if they knew not whither they should go.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;He &ldquo;beckoned unto them; and called them with a loud voice that they should come unto [him], and partake of the fruit, which was desirable above all other fruit.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;They hearkened to him.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Lehi then was desirous that Laman and Lemuel should come and partake of the fruit. . . but they would not come.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;That varying receptiveness of our children to the gospel message is a repeated theme in the Book of Mormon, and often a worry for parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lehi&rsquo;s dream explained some of the reasons people are more or less receptive to the gospel message. You recall that Lehi saw a strait and narrow path and a rod of iron that led to the tree and the fruit.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;&ldquo;Numberless concourses of people were pressing forward [toward] the path which led to the tree.&rdquo;<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>As they sought for the path, a &ldquo;mist of darkness [arose], yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost.&rdquo;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Nephi explained that the mists of darkness were a symbol of the temptations of the devil.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others seen by Lehi found the strait and narrow path and made their way to the tree and partook of the fruit, but he thereafter noted that they &ldquo;did cast about their eyes as if they were ashamed.&rdquo; Lehi then saw a great and spacious building standing in the air, high above the ground. It was &ldquo;filled with people, . . . old and young, . . . male and female; . . . their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were . . . mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had [partaken] of the fruit. [Those who tasted of the fruit and afterwards became ashamed because of the scoffing] &ldquo;fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.&rdquo; <sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lehi saw other explanations for how people end up far from the path of righteousness. However, the mists of darkness or temptation and feeling ashamed because of the ridicule to which gospel beliefs and practices are sometimes subjected, are two major challenges parents continue to confront today as they seek to raise their children in righteousness and help them taste the fruit for themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are all familiar with the problems that Lehi and Sariah had with Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael and his wife. Those problems and their sorry legacy across succeeding generations set the backdrop for much of the secular history recounted in the Book of Mormon. Insofar as we know, neither Laman nor Lemuel ever repented and returned to the path, notwithstanding the remarkable, even miraculous spiritual experiences that were theirs. Although Laman and Lemuel were raised in the same family as Sam, Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, they struggled with the strait and narrow path and never reached the tree or tasted its fruit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A less prominent but spiritually important history involves King Benjamin and his descendants. Following King Benjamin&rsquo;s timeless discourse, his subjects fell to the earth,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . for the fear of the Lord had come upon them. They had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth.&nbsp; And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.&rdquo;<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this occurred, the people &ldquo;were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of their exceeding faith in Jesus Christ.&rdquo;<sup>14&nbsp;</sup>King Benjamin then promised them that if they would repent of their sins and forsake them, then they would &ldquo;always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of [their] sins.&rdquo;<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The people told King Benjamin that they had experienced a &ldquo;mighty change&rdquo; of heart.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;They said that they were &ldquo;willing to enter into a covenant with . . . God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days . . .&rdquo;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, when they had entered into this covenant,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . King Benjamin thought . . . that he should take the names of all those who had entered into a covenant with God to keep his commandments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it came to pass that there was not one soul, except it were little children, but who had entered into the covenant and had taken upon them the name of Christ.&rdquo;<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we have a picture in our minds of this remarkable spiritual change of heart and among the people of King Benjamin, and of their entering a covenant to obey God to the end of their lives. So far, the picture looks great, doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; But stay tuned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we move forward in time just one generation, the picture becomes terribly blemished. You will recall that the only ones who heard King Benjamin speak but did not enter into the covenant were the little children. They were too young to understand his words and to make that covenant. Some of the most chilling words in the Book of Mormon concern those little children once they were grown. We read,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of King Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the coming of Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now because of their unbelief they could not understand the word of God; and their hearts were hardened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they would not be baptized; neither would they join the church.&nbsp; And they were a separate people as to their faith, and remained so ever after, even in their carnal and sinful state; for they would not call upon the Lord their God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now in the reign of Mosiah they were not half so numerous as the people of God; but because of the dissensions among the brethren they became more numerous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For it came to pass that they did deceive many with their flattering words, who were in the church, and did cause them to commit many sins . . .&rdquo;<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These passages always raise questions in my mind: Why? What happened to these children? What went wrong? How did these children miss learning gospel truths? Didn&rsquo;t they hold family home evening? Was there something their parents did or didn&rsquo;t do? Didn&rsquo;t they go to Primary, Young Men, and Young Women classes? The record of the Book of Mormon does not address these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see a similar pattern after the sign was given in the land of promise concerning the birth of the Savior. You recall that the sign of his birth was that there would be a day a night and another day in which there would be no darkness. The people were told that they would see the sun set but that the sky would not darken. That very thing happened, just as prophesied. The Book of Mormon records that,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there were many, who had not believed the words of the prophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had laid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been frustrated; . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly appear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth from the west to the east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to the earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for many years . . . and they began to fear because of their iniquity and their unbelief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day.&nbsp; And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again . . . and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born, because of the sign which had been given.&rdquo;<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this phenomenal experience, the scriptural record states that &ldquo;from [that] time forth there began to be lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs and wonders which they had seen.&rdquo;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Many of the people were baptized and turned to the Lord, but as the years went by &ldquo; . . . many dissenters of the Nephites fled to the Gadianton robbers, causing much sorrow unto those Nephites who did remain in the land.&rdquo;<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lamanites confronted a similar situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for behold, they had many children who did grow up and began to wax strong in years, that they became for themselves, and were led away by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to decrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising generation.&rdquo;<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, we ask: Why? Why did some of the Nephites become dissenters after having personally seen such miraculous evidence of gospel truth? What happened to the children of the Lamanites so that as they matured, they failed to find the strait and narrow path to the fruit? Was there a failure that we can detect and thereby avoid? Are there patterns in these histories that bear examination and comparison to our own days?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we read about mists of darkness, we understand that we are reading about temptations. Not much has changed about the nature of temptation since the dawn of time. It is still an appeal to our appetites, our vanity, or our desire for power. The so-called modern world presents all of the same old temptations that countless generations before us have confronted, although today those temptations come with electronic enhancements - its mists of darkness magnified by megawatts. But there is nothing new about the dead ends that temptation&rsquo;s allures lead to. Breaking the commandments still inevitably yields the same old heartache, regret, and remorse it always has. That hasn&rsquo;t changed and never will. Protecting ourselves and our children against the mists of darkness has become more urgent as the adversary&rsquo;s sales techniques for his same-old-sins-as-always become pervasive in our culture and more sophisticated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also see the Church, its doctrines, and practices subjected to public scrutiny and occasional ridicule and contortion. The new electronic world, which shortens distances between countries to milliseconds as messages speed across the internet, is so different from earlier years. A message can go viral in a matter of hours, regardless of whether it is true and fair. Some reporting can be accurate but some of it also can also be misguided, negligent, or motivated by antipathy for the Church and its message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other attacks can come from time to time from those who are or were members of the Church. Some of these who label themselves &ldquo;insiders&rdquo; mischaracterize the Church&rsquo;s beliefs and history. Others cloak themselves in the robes of believers but in fact have long since taken up residence in the great and spacious building. They portray themselves as too wise to embrace this doctrine or that one. They proclaim that they are better educated and informed than others and thus can be trusted to reliably identify purported defects in Church leaders, history, or practices and thereby protect less well-informed and more gullible believers. Their teachings often ridicule the Church, its teachings, and the believers. This group strains at doctrinal and historical gnats but unconsciously swallows camels as they pick at some point but miss the grandeur, scope, and power of the work of salvation the Lord set in motion in 1820.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another challenge, perhaps more subtle than the ones we have been talking about, is the influence of affluence and abundance. This trial hardly seems to be a trial at all. Can there be too much of a good thing? Yes, there can be, when ease and prosperity begin to guide decisions and moderate obedience to fundamental gospel principles. This affliction has been described as getting &ldquo;caught up in the thick of thin things,&rdquo; or being &ldquo;anxiously engaged&rdquo; in a cause that doesn&rsquo;t matter. This occurs when the things of the world, its enticements and allures, increasingly distract us from things of lasting value. Our attention slowly moves toward interests of only passing fancy, and the way we use our time soon follows. Things of little meaning begin to encroach against time that should be devoted to better things, and gradually we wander from the path to the fruit without even being aware that we are doing so. Some of these pursuits and interests may be harmless, but they are of no real value either. Unfortunately, some who wander may justify thoughts and other indulgences that they would never attempt to defend before the Lord Himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon captures the spirit of this challenge with these words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well&mdash;and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none&mdash;and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together the challenges of temptation, ridicule, and ease, constitute just some of the uneven terrain today&rsquo;s pioneering parents and their children must cross. The pioneers of the 1800s knew that they were crossing the plains. Their very survival was sometimes a question. Today&rsquo;s Rocky Ridges and Sweetwater Rivers don&rsquo;t come complete with handcarts. We may not even recognize the trial of our faith when we are in the midst of it. If we don&rsquo;t, it is even more unlikely that our children will. Indeed, our challenges seem to be more like those that we have reviewed today from the Book of Mormon, where people surrounded by truth wandered away from it, walking in darkness when the light of the gospel shone like the sun at noon day around them. We are not the first to confront such difficulties, and we certainly won&rsquo;t be the last. Our families must be the bulwark of defense against this deadly spiritual hazard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants explains that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.&rdquo;<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, we lose light and truth as individuals as a consequence of our own personal disobedience of the commandments and also as a consequence of the traditions of our fathers, meaning our families. One meaning for traditions is the family culture in which we were raised or in which we raise our children. We lose light and truth when our family culture crowds them out of the home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No home is perfect, but some homes do a better job of passing down correct traditions, or correct gospel habits and patterns of belief, to their children. Similarly, no children are perfect. Some come more inclined toward obedience than others. In this regard, it is important to remember something taught by President James E. Faust. He said,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are good parents? They are those who have lovingly, prayerfully, and earnestly tried to teach their children by example and precept &ldquo;to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.&rdquo; This is true even though some of their children are disobedient or worldly. Children come into this world with their own distinct spirits and personality traits. Some children &ldquo;would challenge any set of parents under any set of circumstances. &hellip; Perhaps there are others who would bless the lives of, and be a joy to, almost any father or mother.&rdquo; Successful parents are those who have sacrificed and struggled to do the best they can in their own family circumstances.&rdquo;<sup>26</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife and I live in Salt Lake City, up along the hills on the east side of town. An indigenous tree that grows in our part of town is commonly referred to as scrub oak. These trees tend to be shorter and have much thinner trunks than do other oak trees. They grow as volunteers and have been adopted by many homeowners as part of their landscaping. We have several trees in the front yard of our home and a few more in the rear. The scrub oaks are quite old. They have endured countless winters, hot dry summers, the construction of nearby houses, and the benign neglect of well-intentioned but hapless gardeners like me. Somehow, notwithstanding all the reasons that they should fare poorly, they do beautifully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a large pot that sits along the walkway to our front door. We try to keep flowers blooming in the pot from early spring until late fall.&nbsp; The pot sits directly under limbs of one of our scrub oaks. A couple of years ago I was tending to the flowers in the pot when I discovered that some of the acorns from the scrub oak had fallen into the pot. I pulled on a tiny seedling scrub oak, just visible a couple of inches above the surface of the potting soil. To my surprise, I continued to pull and pull and the root for the seedling kept coming. I found another couple of seedlings and pulled them out as well. Each one had a root structure that was much longer or deeper than the above the ground portion of the little tree would ever reveal. I was so astonished by the length of the roots that I took a photo of some of the roots next to a 12-inch ruler, to be sure that the lesson I was learning was not lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scrub oak trees are prepared by nature to be successful in the somewhat harsh environment in which they live. They are naturally designed to endure long cold winters, windy nights, hot summers, and variable rainfall. One obvious key to their success is that deep root, which protects them against the various threats to their well-being and very lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That secret of the scrub oak seedling&rsquo;s success &ndash; its long roots &ndash; suggests that we can do much to protect ourselves and the rising generation by ensuring that our spiritual roots have been sent down deep into the soils of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His Restored Gospel. By doing so we become rooted with a lifelong and enduring faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will suggest six steps that we can take to help us and our children to send down roots deep into the soils of faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Strengthen Your Testimony</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can begin by ensuring that we have a personal, burning, deeply-seated, lifelong testimony of the restored gospel. This testimony is available to all who will pay the price to receive it. The Book of Mormon is central to receiving a testimony that can withstand any temptation and weather any challenge. The introduction to the Book of Mormon states:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; (See Moroni 10:3&ndash;5.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also come to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that Joseph Smith is his revelator and prophet in these last days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord's kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the second coming of the Messiah.&rdquo;<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This path to testimony applies to all, including and perhaps especially those who have been raised surrounded by the restored gospel but who have never personally made a real, searching, genuine effort to find out if the message of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true. The promise is that those who &ldquo;read the Book of Mormon,&rdquo; &ldquo;ponder in their hearts&rdquo; its message, ask God in faith in the name of Christ if the book is true, &ldquo;will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;By pursuing this course, they will also come to know of the divinity of the Savior, the divine mission of Joseph Smith, and the heavenly origin of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ask in faith is to act with real intent, affirming sincerely to God that one is not asking out of curiosity but with firm commitment to conform one&rsquo;s life to the answer that comes from heaven. This means &ldquo;acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God&rdquo; in our reading, pondering, and praying.<sup>29&nbsp;</sup>Academic interest in the book is not sufficient. A spiritual joyride, like taking a car for a test drive, is not enough. What is required is the genuine desire to obey God if revelation comes that the book is true. This necessarily means reading in such a way as to seek confirming spiritual evidence that the book is true. It means choosing study materials that are intended to strengthen rather than weaken faith. It means accepting the Book of Mormon&rsquo;s promise as a promise from God and taking Him at His word. Whenever one applies the Book of Mormon&rsquo;s promise faithfully, with real intent, the answer will come. It may come immediately and powerfully, or it may come gradually, almost without notice, but the promise will always be fulfilled. Always means always.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Keep the Commandments</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consistent with the principles for reading, pondering about and praying to learn that the Book of Mormon is true, is the requirement that one keep the commandments of God. The Savior taught this principle concerning gaining a testimony:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>
<p>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or <em>whether</em> I speak of myself.&rdquo; <sup>30</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obedience to the principles of the Gospel is a fundamental element in gaining, maintaining, and strengthening a testimony. If we do God&rsquo;s will, we shall then learn whether the doctrine comes from God or man. This is not a call for fanatical, blind obedience, but an invitation to heartfelt, sincere obedience that is given because of what one sees, feels, and learns when he or she keeps the commandments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Serve in the Church</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord revealed to Joseph Smith that those who would serve in the Church would be blessed with a testimony of his divine appointment as a prophet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For, behold, I will bless all those who labor in my vineyard with a mighty blessing, and they shall believe on his [Joseph Smith&rsquo;s] words, which are given him through me by the Comforter,&rdquo;<sup>31</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A call to serve is an opportunity to deepen spiritual roots and strengthen faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Keep Priorities in Order</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This principle for deepening our roots is based on ordered priorities. It is connected to the principle of integrity, of living consistently the covenants one has made with God and with spouse. President Gordon B. Hinckley taught priesthood leaders across the world:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each of us has a fourfold responsibility. First, we have a responsibility to our families. Second, we have a responsibility to our employers. Third, we have a responsibility to the Lord&rsquo;s work. Fourth, we have a responsibility to ourselves.&rdquo;<sup>32</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At times each of these priorities will take precedence on a given day and hour, but overall they should fit within this order. As couples and families we determine how much time we will spend in each of these endeavors and then stick with it, putting things in order and keeping them there. Abiding by correct priorities will help deepen our roots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Strengthen Our Marriages</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrity teaches that one must live up to one&rsquo;s promises in all circumstances. When other interests edge their way ahead of home and hearth, a spouse may rightly feel disappointed and misled and children may correctly perceive that keeping covenants must not be important to us. These feelings and perceptions can slowly wither a marriage and drain a child&rsquo;s budding faith and testimony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord has commanded husbands and wives to cleave to each other (see Genesis 2:24; D&amp;C 42:22). In this commandment, the word cleave means to be completely devoted and faithful to someone. Married couples cleave to God and one another by serving and loving each other and by keeping covenants in complete ï¬delity to one another and to God (see D&amp;C 25:13).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple is to become one in establishing their family as the basis of a righteous life. Latter-day Saint husbands and wives leave behind their single life and establish their marriage as the ï¬rst priority in their lives. They allow no other person or interest to have greater priority in their lives than keeping the covenants they have made with God and each other.&rdquo;<sup>33</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strengthening our marriages deepens gospel roots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Strengthen Children</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that there is much we can do in our homes to help build faith in the rising generation. Surely some of those who have wandered at any point in human history might have been more faithful had their homes been better. In homes where the gospel flourishes, children more easily prosper. They don&rsquo;t wonder why there are differences between what they hear from the pulpit and what they observe at home. Habits of faith are established, like scripture reading, family home evening, and family prayer. Children learn from the example of their parents what it means to love, honor, and cherish each other. They are more likely to read the Book of Mormon, pray of their own volition, and receive their own testimonies. They see what a great home looks like, know what it feels like, and have a pattern for starting their own. They observe love and conversion in action, and their souls are warmed by what they see and feel. Thus safe at home, children are better able to send down tap roots deep into spiritual soil, and build testimonies that burn brightly forever and conversion that cannot be extinguished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In homes like this, the rising generation is safe. Children raised there will, as Paul wrote, be &ldquo;firmly rooted and built up in [the Savior], and stablished in the faith.&rdquo;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;They won&rsquo;t be spoiled &ldquo;through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world,&rdquo; because they will be able to see and feel their way through the sophistry.<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;Their rootedness becomes their iron rod in the mists of darkness.<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;If there are ravening wolves circling and threatening at the heels of the flock, they will recognize them and detect their false claims. They will see through the mists of darkness, endure the heat of the day during persecution, and survive frigid nights of ridicule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will always be the sons of Mosiah and Almas, who may wander from the flock, but the Lord will feel after them and bring them back into the fold. The righteousness of their parents will help to secure that end for them. The day of their return may not be soon, but in the Lord&rsquo;s own way and time, upon conditions of repentance, deliverance will surely come. There will also be some Lamans and Lemuels among our families. We simply trust that the Lord will deal with them and with us in His own loving, merciful way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The theme for this year&rsquo;s BYU&ndash;Idaho Education Week is, &ldquo;Lord, I Would Follow Thee.&rdquo;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;My prayer is that we may follow Him most closely and more carefully at home. This is a prayer for our children and for the rising generation, that in time each one of them may also pray, &ldquo;Lord, I would follow thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, welcome to campus at this beautiful time of year. I pray that the Holy Spirit will edify us this day as we discuss a topic of most singular importance. That topic is recognizing and increasing personal revelation.&nbsp; The scriptures are replete with promises that God will answer our prayers. The Savior taught in the Sermon on the Mount, &ldquo;Ask, and it shall be given you. Seek, and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In the final stages of His ministry, He promised His disciples that &ldquo;all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what about those times when it seems as if the voice of the Holy Ghost is silent? Today I wish to speak to any of you who may feel your prayers have ever gone unanswered. First, let&rsquo;s outline how we can recognize revelation, then we will discuss how to increase it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recognizing Personal Revelation </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants section 6, the Lord teaches Oliver Cowdery that He has answered his prayers through the Spirit &ldquo;as often as [he had] inquired,&rdquo; even though Oliver may not have realized it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;blessed art thou for what thou hast done; for thou hast inquired of me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired thou hast received instruction of my Spirit&hellip;Now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth.<sup>3</sup>&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /> If we are striving to live righteously, it is possible we may be receiving promptings that we don&rsquo;t recognize. President Lorenzo Snow explained:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[It is] the grand privilege of every Latter-day Saint . . . to have the manifestations of the spirit every day of our lives.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord wants each of us to recognize when the Spirit has enlightened our minds. But in order to do so, we need to be more familiar with the ways the Holy Ghost speaks to us. He can move us to action, give us peace, provide bright ideas, enhance our intelligence, magnify our talents and give us the very words we should speak or write.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Sheri Dew has said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Holy Ghost will show us everything we should do, [so] it only makes sense to learn how He communicates&mdash;or to learn the language of revelation. Our challenge is not getting the Lord to speak to us; our challenge is understanding what He has to say.<sup>5</sup>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to better understand how God communicates with us, I invite you to consider with me four common types of personal revelation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the first type of revelation, divine promptings, the Spirit attempts to inspire us with divine communication that is unsolicited on our part. The second and third types of revelation, direct answers and confirming answers, occur when we initiate a two-way exchange by asking. The fourth type, ongoing promptings, is demonstrated when we request guidance that we don&rsquo;t receive immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Divine Promptings</em></strong></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first discuss divine promptings. We can receive promptings to stop by and visit a friend who is having a bad day, or take a different route to avoid an accident. We don&rsquo;t always recognize that these ideas or feelings are coming from the Holy Spirit until after we act on them. However, if we recognize these divine directives for what they are, and thank the Lord for guidance, we will be better prepared to receive more in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I learned a great lesson about recognizing and following divine promptings when my daughter, Zoe, and I were leaving Wal-Mart one evening. It was a crowded parking lot, and we were parked way in the back. Just as we arrived at our car, something caught our eyes, as it was blowing by in the breeze. Upon closer examination, we discovered it was a twenty-dollar bill tumbling along the asphalt. I told my daughter it was her lucky day as she chased it down. Once we got in the car, we both had a strong feeling to take the money into the store. This seemed like a silly thought, so we were tempted to dismiss the idea. But after discussing it with Zoe, we decided to take the twenty-dollar bill to the service desk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service desk attendant told us to keep the money. She said it was a nice gesture, but she was certain we could not find the owner. She told us she could take our name and number, but that no one ever came to the desk asking for missing cash, so it would be unnecessary. Then she had us wait while she answered the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A moment later, we noticed she had a shocked look on her face as she stared at us. She put the call on hold and explained, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re never going to believe this. There is a woman on the phone, in tears, who lost her twenty-dollar bill somewhere at Wal-Mart. I can hear a baby crying in the background. She says she needs the money desperately because it&rsquo;s all she has for the rest of the month. She has been hoping and praying that someone turned it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We could have easily left that parking lot feeling thrilled to have found a twenty-dollar bill blowing by in the breeze. Instead we gained the far greater treasure of knowing that the Lord cares and watches over the little things we do. The guidance we received was an answer to this woman&rsquo;s prayer. We treasure this &ldquo;Parable of the Twenty Dollar Bill.&rdquo; We learned that if we have a good thought, but we are unsure if it is a prompting, act on it anyway. As long as it is a good thing, how can we go wrong? Such unsolicited divine promptings may be God&rsquo;s way of helping us or someone else in need. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Direct Answers</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second type of personal revelation is direct answers, which come promptly when we ask for guidance. A typical question we ask in our prayers might be &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; Consider the example of Abraham&rsquo;s servant when Abraham asked him to fetch a worthy wife for his son Isaac. What a monumental task to be trusted with, to find the mother of Israel! With complete trust and faith in the Lord, the servant asked God to direct him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After taking ten of Abraham&rsquo;s camels he stopped outside the city of Nahor to watch as the women came out to draw water. Then, with incredible faith, he asked God to let him know which woman was chosen for Isaac by whether or not she would give water to him and offer to water the camels. Then, even before he was done speaking his prayer, the very fair Rebekah came along. When he asked for water, she not only assisted him, but she also drew water for all his camels.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am amazed and humbled by the example of Abraham&rsquo;s servant and the worthiness and responsiveness of Rebekah. They were both guided by the Holy Ghost. It was no small task for Rebekah to use her pitcher to fetch enough water for ten camels, yet it was this generous offer that let Abraham&rsquo;s servant know she was the one the Lord had chosen. The servant had powerful faith to even ask for such an immediate response. He called down the powers of heaven when he needed important, divine guidance and he immediately received a direct answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We too can receive prompt and direct answers when we ask in faith, if it is in accordance with our Father in Heaven&rsquo;s will. It does not have to be as important as who to marry, or what career path to pursue. It can be a simple daily request. If we fail to ask in faith, we may miss out on blessings. If we have a worthy request that is not too trivial, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, there are times when we do not receive any kind of discernable answer, no matter how hard we try to recognize it. This is when the Lord trusts us to proceed on our own. Then if we start to stray from the Lord&rsquo;s will, the Spirit will guide us back to the proper path. <br /> <br /> <strong><em>Confirming Answers</em></strong><br /> <strong><br /> </strong>The third type of revelation is confirming answers. This is when we study something out in our mind first, then make a decision and ask if it is right. Section nine of the Doctrine and Covenants provides us with a step-by-step process of how to receive revelation in this pattern. Verse eight points out that a burning of the bosom means simply that we &ldquo;shall feel that it is right.&rdquo; Verse nine explains that a &ldquo;stupor of thought&rdquo; causes us to forget the thing we are asking. It is that simple.<sup>7&nbsp;</sup><br /> <br /> When we pray using this pattern, we can receive revelation in one of three ways: <br /> first, a positive answer confirming that our decision is right; second, a negative answer causing us to forget what we asked; and third, a negative answer, followed by a new, better idea. I have relied on this pattern and have been blessed to receive all three types of answers at various times in my life. &nbsp;<br /> <br /> One such occasion occurred while I was spearheading an effort in Blackfoot, Idaho, to get a new Bingham County ordinance that would help reduce teenage smoking. At the time, an alarming twenty-seven percent of Idaho teens were smoking. We discovered that tobacco companies were placing their products near candy to encourage teens and children to steal, which, of course, produced more addicted customers. In turn, tobacco reps were offering to replace that stolen product for free. You can imagine how this stirred up a group of PTA moms!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we drafted a county ordinance that would move tobacco products behind the counter, ban tobacco vending machines, and require licensing, inspections and fines. After our first meeting, it was apparent the commissioners were willing to pass the county ordinance, despite opposition from some local retailers. However, I had an uneasy feeling for some reason, and I started doubting things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I followed the counsel in the ninth section of the Doctrine and Covenants in order to receive a confirmation regarding our efforts. First I studied it out logically and resolved that I was still on track. Then I prayed to ask the Lord if this was right thing. I paused to listen, but I did not get a burning, or a feeling that it was right. Instead I had a hard time focusing on my question. My mind wandered and I had to keep reminding myself what I was asking. I did not hear a &ldquo;no.&rdquo; I just had no feeling at all. Then as I practiced the &ldquo;pause principle&rdquo; and knelt in absolute silence, a new idea came into my mind. The idea was to abandon our attempt for a county ordinance and try for a new state law instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This made perfect sense, when it came from the Lord. I would have never attempted this on my own, but I was filled with a peaceful reassurance to move forward. The Lord had communicated His will to me through the Holy Ghost and I knew He would help me with the large task that was ahead. I spent the next year researching, writing a bill, finding legislators who would sponsor it, and enduring a battle with the national tobacco lobby, after which the state legislature adopted a new Idaho statute called the &ldquo;Prevention of Minors&rsquo; Access to Tobacco."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the Lord was guiding this entire process. One year after the law was adopted, minors&rsquo; access to tobacco in Idaho was reduced by fifty percent. Practicing these few powerful verses helped prepare me to recognize the voice of the Lord so I could hear the confirming answer, which came first as a stupor of thought, followed by a better idea. If we will take the time to study, ask, pause, listen and then follow through on the answers, we can all receive the sudden strokes of divine inspiration Joseph Smith described when he taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas . . . and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prophet Joseph teaches us that with practice, we can learn and improve in our ability to recognize the Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Ongoing Promptings</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>Sometimes when we ask, we do not get an immediate answer, but it comes later. Or we ask for help over a continuing period of time. This brings us to the fourth type of revelation. Ongoing promptings can come during a performance, as we take a test, while we converse with someone, or as an event unfolds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our daughter, Rachel, had an interesting experience with this type of revelation when she was the LDSSA president at Harvard four years ago. She was invited to represent the LDS faith on a panel of students to be interviewed by a famous journalist, Sally Quinn, regarding their religious beliefs. Quinn questioned Rachel for twenty minutes in an interview that went viral on the Internet.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In high school, Rachel often stayed after school to ask questions of seminary teachers so she would better understand gospel principles. In college, she learned all she could in her Institute classes and personal studies about the gospel and other world religions. In a sense she had always prepared herself for this type of opportunity to share the gospel. But when Sally Quinn started with questions about women&rsquo;s role in the Church, Joseph Smith, and the LDS faith being a cult, I wondered how Rachel would respond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the fact that, as one online commenter wrote, Quinn&rsquo;s tone was at times &nbsp;&ldquo;somewhat mocking and derisive,&rdquo; the Spirit was able to guide Rachel in her responses. For example, at one point, Quinn asked Rachel to explain LDS garments, whether or not she was wearing them, and how they related to secret temple ordinances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In reply, Rachel referred to something she had read the night before in Genesis when God was making a covenant with Abraham. She said that LDS garments were also a token of sacred covenants we make with God. She explained they are white underwear that comes to the top of the knee and past the edge of the shoulder that provide protection if worn worthily. She also divulged that she did not yet wear garments, because she had not yet been through the temple.<br /> <br /> Rachel told me later that she felt the Spirit helping her to answer these questions openly, while still respecting the sacred nature of the subject. The Spirit brought things to her remembrance during the interview that she had learned previously. This is an example of how ongoing promptings can prepare us for and guide us during an event or conversation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On another note, if we ever feel we are prompted down a path that is contrary to gospel doctrine or the decisions of our leaders, then we should consider it to be counterfeit revelation. This can come from the adversary or from our own mortal follies. There are also times we may follow a prompting that later seems wrong, yet there could be a good reason we needed to take a longer path for a learning experience. The key is to be sure our thoughts and actions are in harmony with gospel teachings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Increasing Personal Revelation </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that we have discussed how to recognize four types of personal revelation, it is important to learn how to increase the promptings we receive. May I suggest three ways we can increase our access to daily personal revelation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sincere Prayer</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, improving the quality of our prayers is essential to improving our ability to receive personal revelation. Bishop H. Burke Peterson describes both sides of the spiritual communication process:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;go where you can be alone, go where you can think, go where you can kneel, go where you can speak out loud to him. The bedroom, the bathroom, or the closet will do. Now, picture him in your mind&rsquo;s eye&hellip;control your thoughts&mdash;don&rsquo;t let them wander, address him as your Father and your friend&hellip;have a sincere, heartfelt conversation with him. Confide in him, ask him for forgiveness, plead with him, enjoy him, thank him, express your love to him, and then listen for his answers. &hellip; Answers from the Lord come quietly&mdash;ever so quietly. In fact, few hear his answers audibly with their ears. We must be listening so carefully or we will never recognize them. Most answers from the Lord are felt in our heart as a warm comfortable expression, or they may come as thoughts to our mind. They come to those who are prepared and who are patient.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It takes a conscious effort to have this type of daily communication with the Lord. It is not always convenient. Yet, if we want more powerful daily revelations and guidance, it is well worth it. Our lives will go so much better if we are in tune with the Spirit by practicing this language of revelation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our nine-year old grandson, Max, is already learning this important principle. He recently told me he felt the Spirit one night after he said his prayers which made him very happy that Heavenly Father was listening. I asked him why he thought he felt the Spirit and he told me, "That night I had a longer prayer and I put a lot more stuff in it." Maybe if we put a lot more stuff in our prayers&mdash;more sincerity and honesty and feeling&mdash;we too will feel a greater measure of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Earnest Scripture Study</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important part of spiritual communication is to study the scriptures. Our five-year old granddaughter, Lillian, reminded me how we can receive our own witness if we study, ponder and record what we feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day after her nap, Lillian asked her father if he wanted to hear a new scripture she learned. She told her dad she would tell him the numbers first, then the words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chapter 14:16:19 Do not mock those who have been nice to you, for they could be your friends.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /> She told her father she came up with it on her own and thought it should be scripture. He explained how Heavenly Father works through prophets to give us the scriptures. She was happy when her dad told her he would write down her own personal quote and remember it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When he asked Lillian if she knew what mocking was, she said it was what Nephi&rsquo;s brothers did to him for being courageous and building a boat. By studying scriptures with her family and pondering them during her nap time, Lillian received her own personal witness about how to treat others. The Spirit whispered understanding to her and she comprehended the language of revelation at a very young age. If we take more time to study the scriptures and ponder their meaning, we will have more opportunities for personal revelation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>The &ldquo;Pause Principle&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>Finally, the most overlooked but perhaps the most important part of the spiritual communication process is to pause and listen. Let's call this the &ldquo;pause principle." This simple concept of taking time to pause can dramatically improve our ability to hear and feel the Holy Ghost. If you believe you are not receiving daily personal revelation, this one principle alone can make a big difference. Now this means putting down the phone, the ear buds, the iPods. If we consciously slow down and pause more often, we will receive more daily personal revelation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boyd K. Packer explained that the Holy Ghost may not wait if we are not ready to hear:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all. . . .</p>
<p>Occasionally it will press just firmly enough for us to pay heed. But most of the time, if we do not heed the gentle feeling, the Spirit will withdraw and wait until we come seeking and listening.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I often get too busy and forget to pause when I need help. When my mother died last October, I was sad and needed the Comforter, yet I was so busy taking care of details I failed to pause. We had asked my mother&rsquo;s dear friend to give the life sketch, but she needed some more information. For years I had asked my mother if she had written journals or finished a personal history. She always told me she had, but she could never remember where they were. I had given up hope of ever finding the lost records. My father was not sure they even existed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The night after my mother&rsquo;s death, I was staying at my parents&rsquo; home in Pocatello, Idaho, gathering some of my mother&rsquo;s belongings for a display at the viewing.&nbsp; I laid down on the couch to rest and my mind stopped spinning.&nbsp; I paused, and this is when a quiet thought came to my mind, &ldquo;Go up and look on the shelves in the west bedroom.&rdquo; I followed this prompting, hopeful I would find some more treasures for the display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was delighted to find a jewelry box filled with wonderful trinkets. Then I continued down the bookcase where I found a large, white box. I sat down on the bed and opened this box to find volumes of my mother&rsquo;s personal journals written in her own hand, plus several letters and personal histories written at various times throughout her life. I also found many long-lost beautiful photos of my mother as a child, college student, young wife and mother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I immediately felt the presence of my mother in that room. I sensed a great feeling of relief from her. She was so grateful that I had finally found the missing journals and photos that had been lost for years. I now treasure these family records. I am so grateful that I slowed down long enough to heed the promptings of the still, small voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pause principle is an indispensable aide in recognizing the promptings of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Too often we spend our entire prayer time asking for things. Pausing is an important part of receiving personal revelation. Whether we are in the middle of a heartfelt prayer, responding to a question, or planning an event, we should take a moment to pause and listen. This gives the Spirit a chance to share divine communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that this process of personal revelation can operate for each and every one of us. The Holy Ghost is real. Each of us can learn to recognize how He communicates if we learn to understand and act on the four common types of revelation: divine promptings, direct answers, confirming answers, and ongoing promptings. Then, if we pray sincerely, study the scriptures earnestly, and take time to pause and listen, we can increase the daily personal revelation we receive. Through this process, I know we can improve our personal relationship with the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful for a loving Heavenly Father who sacrificed His only Begotten Son. I am indebted to my Savior for His atoning sacrifice, and I am filled with gratitude for the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost, a constant companion and member of the Godhead who is always ready to guide us. I bear you my testimony of the truthfulness of this gospel, in the name of our beloved Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters, I am grateful to be gathered with you today on this BYU-Idaho campus. &nbsp;I am grateful for the goodness found on this campus and for all that you do to make BYU-Idaho such a great place to learn. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be here so that we can be taught.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to share with you an experience I had when I was a young man. I was born and raised in Montana and I lived just a few hours from the Rocky Mountains. In the scouting program, one of the activities I looked forward to each summer was backpacking in the Bob Marshall Wilderness area, which is located south of Glacier Park. On one trip our leaders planned a three-day hike that started at Benchmark and finished at Gibson Lake just outside of Augusta, Montana. Our leaders planned for us to hike six to eight miles each day so we could reach our final destination in three days and meet up with our transportation, so we could return home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the second day of the trip we reached a beautiful meadow called Pretty Prairie. Pretty Prairie is a very long meadow with mountains on one side and the South Fork of the Sun River on other. When we reached this meadow the trail disappeared. As we walked through this long meadow we noticed a trail that went up the mountainside and we assumed that it was the trail we needed to take and so we followed it. The trail was very narrow and steep and after a few miles the trail reached the top of this mountain and disappeared. At this time our leaders were confused and they decided to pull the maps and compass to see where the trail went. According to the map we were not on a trail. It appeared that we found a game trail or a trail used by deer, elk or mountain goats. Upon further inspection of the map we found that we had traveled far from our course. We needed to go back to the beautiful meadow and on the opposite side of the meadow from where we entered was the trail we needed to be on to reach our final destination. As young scouts, we were exhausted and a few scouts were in tears. We were disappointed with having to follow the same trail back to the meadow to correct our mistake. We calculated that the mistake caused us to hike an additional four to five miles extra that day. I learned on that trip that backpacking was more enjoyable if you closely follow a good map and use a compass to help you reach your final destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like backpacking, our life on this earth has a purpose or a destination and it is important for each of us to know what that destination is and follow the map and compass our Father in Heaven has provided for us. This compass and map is called The Plan of Salvation or The Great Plan of Happiness. The description of the map and detailed instructions of how we are to use the compass are given to us in the scriptures and through our living Prophets today. Like a map the scriptures and prophets teach us where we came from and the direction we need to go to reach our final destination. Utilizing the scriptures and abiding by the teachings of our prophets today you and I can avoid the pitfalls and game trails and stay on the trail or the path that will lead us back to live with our Heavenly Father. Today, I would like to use the scriptures and the words of our prophets to talk about the &ldquo;Great Plan of Happiness&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Job chapter 38 verses 6 through 7 we are taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6&nbsp;Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7&nbsp;When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the pre-mortal existence each of us shouted for joy when we learned of the opportunity for us to come to earth and experience &ldquo;The Great Plan of Happiness&rdquo;. Why were we so happy to come to this earth and participate in this great plan?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Abraham chapter 3 verses 22 through 25 we are taught:</p>
<p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>22 Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>23 And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>24 And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and<sup> </sup>we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>25&nbsp;And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>22 Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>23 And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>24 And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and<sup> </sup>we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>25&nbsp;And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We existed as &ldquo;intelligences&rdquo; and &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; before we came to this earth and the purpose for each of us was to come to this earth to see if we will do all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall command us. This to me sounds like an exam, and not just a unit exam but a final exam. So why were we excited to come to this earth and participate in &ldquo;The Great Plan of Happiness&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants section 131 verses 6 through 8 we learn more about our spirits:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6&nbsp;It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7&nbsp;There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8&nbsp;We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary, immaterial is an adjective defined as: &ldquo;not consisting of matter or unimportant&rdquo;. In Science we define matter as anything that has mass and occupies space. I must also add that chemistry is the study of matter and we learn from the scriptures that our spirits consist of matter. So, for those of you who will be taking chemistry in the future we learn from the scriptures that chemistry does matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Abraham chapter 5 verse 7 we learn:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7&nbsp;And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground, and took his spirit (that is, the man&rsquo;s spirit), and put it into him; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We came to this earth to gain this body, which is formed from the dust of the earth, and our spirits, which consists of matter, was then placed into our bodies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants section 93 verses 33 through 35 we are taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>33&nbsp;For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fullness of joy;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>34&nbsp;And when separated, man cannot receive a fullness of joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>35&nbsp;The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chemical elements are defined as chemical substances consisting of one type of atom. In Chemistry we have the periodic table of elements that make up all chemical substances and compounds that are composed of different types of elements, including compounds that our physical bodies need to survive and live on this earth. In order for us to receive a fullness of joy our bodies made up of elements and our spirits made of matter must be inseparably connected.&nbsp; That is why the &ldquo;Plan of Salvations is also called &ldquo;The Great Plan of Happiness&rdquo;. We knew that in the pre-mortal existence that in order for us to be happy and receive a &ldquo;fullness of joy&rdquo; we had to gain our physical bodies and be tested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We live in a world of uncertainty where many of Heavenly Father&rsquo;s children are confused. Many times throughout my life I have heard people say that they do not participate in religion because they feel it is too controlling. I have heard others say that the commandments take all the fun out of life. I have also heard a few students state that they did not like attending BYU-Idaho because they felt that the rules here take the fun out of going to college. The longer I have lived on this earth the more I recognize these ideas are lies from the adversary. Satan, the father of all lies, wants us to think we are missing out on fun and tempts us to follow a different plan from the plan our Father in Heaven has outlined for us. I have noticed throughout my life that those who keep the commandments are happier while those who break the commandments are miserable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October 2011 General Conference President Monson taught:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may appear to you at times that those out in the world are having much more fun than you are. Some of you may feel restricted by the code of conduct to which we in the Church adhere. My brothers and sisters, I declare to you, however, that there is <em>nothing</em>, which can bring more joy into our lives or more peace to our souls than the Spirit, which can come to us as we follow the Savior and keep the commandments. That Spirit cannot be present at the kinds of activities in which so much of the world participates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lehi towards the end of his life called his family together to teach them before he passed away.&nbsp; In 2 Nephi chapter 2 verse 25 we read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>25&nbsp;Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In verse 28 of the same chapter Lehi continues his counsel to his family:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>28&nbsp;And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lehi taught his family &ldquo;The Great Plan of Happiness&rdquo;. He stated that the purpose of life is that we might have joy. Lehi also taught his family to follow the example of the Savior that by keeping the commandments and following the spirit they would be choosing eternal life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Alma chapter 41 verse 10 Alma taught his son Corianton that &ldquo;Wickedness never was happiness&rdquo;. I know that as we keep the commandments we are happy and likewise if we do not keep the commandments we will be miserable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of &ldquo;The Great Plan of Happiness&rdquo; is the progress we make in this life to become spiritually self-reliant. I have been asked by family and friends how BYU-Idaho is different from other universities. You and I have a unique opportunity to work and attend a university that is concerned not only with our development spiritually but also in our development academically. How we develop spiritually will depend on what you and I do and the choices we make. I am convinced that through the revelation of prophets, BYU-Idaho was built to provide an environment where students can develop good habits that will help them develop spiritual self-reliance and become more like the Savior. I would like to suggest four areas that we can always improve on here at BYU-Idaho that will help strengthen us spiritually so we can be happy in this life and receive a fullness of joy in the life to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, make the temple an important part of your educational experience here at BYU-Idaho. We are blessed to have a temple close to campus where we can participate in temple ordinances. Each of us is promised specific blessings as we attend the temple.&nbsp; In the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland temple found in the Doctrine and Covenants section 109 verses 12 and 15, we are promised that the &ldquo;power and glory&rdquo; of the Lord will be upon those that enter His Holy house and they will receive a fullness of the Holy Ghost. These blessings are promised to anyone who enters His Holy House. I was taught by a Priesthood leader that when I attend the temple I should go to the temple with questions. I have found that when I attend the temple with questions I receive answers and a greater understanding of &ldquo;The Great Plan of Happiness&rdquo;, which brings hope and peace to my life, which I am grateful for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, live the gospel by being an active participant in the wards you reside. Prepare yourselves each week to attend church, partake of the Sacrament, and be taught. Arrive to your Sacrament meeting early so you can listen to the prelude music and prepare yourselves to partake of the Sacrament and renew your covenants. Be prepared to participate in the Sunday School lesson and Priesthood or Relief Society lesson. Strive to magnify your callings to the best of your ability. Complete the assignments you are asked to fulfill by your Priesthood leaders. I learned early in life that attending church on Sunday prepared me for the responsibilities I needed to accomplish that week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, make your homes and apartments a sanctuary from the world. The Bible dictionary under temple states: &ldquo;A temple is a place where the Lord may come, it is the most holy of any place of worship on the earth. Only the home can compare with the temple in sacredness&rdquo;. Are our homes and apartments a sanctuary from the world? Do you view your apartment or home as a sacred place and make sure nothing enters your home on the TV, computer, or cell phone that would detract from that sacredness?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants Section 88 versus 118 through 126 we learn how we should organize ourselves and our homes. We learn what we need to do to develop spiritually so we are prepared to go back and live with our Father in Heaven. We read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>118&nbsp;And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>119&nbsp;Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>120&nbsp;That your incomings may be in the name of the Lord; that your outgoings may be in the name of the Lord; that all your salutations may be in the name of the Lord, with uplifted hands unto the Most High.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>121&nbsp;Therefore, cease from all your light speeches, from all laughter, from all your lustful desires, from all your pride and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked doings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>122&nbsp;Appoint among yourselves a teacher, and let not all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>123&nbsp;See that ye love one another; cease to be covetous; learn to impart one to another as the gospel requires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>124&nbsp;Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>125&nbsp;And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with a mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>126&nbsp;Pray always, that ye may not faint, until I come. Behold, and lo, I will come quickly, and receive you unto myself. Amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verses 119 and 120 teach us what we need to do in our homes to establish an environment that is conducive for the spirit to abide there. Whether we live in a basement apartment or in a mansion, if we are single or married with children, we can create an atmosphere in our homes that will invite the spirit. Verses 121 through 125 provide traits and qualities we need to acquire to become more like the Savior. I personally feel that if our homes are not in order, it will be difficult for us to develop the qualities described in verses 121 through 125. We are promised in verse 126 that in the end if we work to establish a &ldquo;House of God&rdquo; and to develop spiritually to become like the Savior, He will receive us unto Himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, live the honor code and follow the dress and grooming standards. There are very few places of higher education that strive to create an atmosphere of learning that is conducive to the Spirit of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; I have been a student on other campuses that do not have the honor code nor the dress and grooming standards. I have witnessed the distractions of what some might call &ldquo;fun&rdquo; that actually create an environment that is destructive to academic and spiritual learning. As I served as a counselor in a bishopric here on campus I noticed that many students had a positive attitude concerning the honor code and the dress and grooming standards. Those were the students who were happy and fun to be around. The few students who disobeyed the honor code and the dress and grooming standards were miserable and they did not have a good experience here at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Plan of Salvation or The Great Plan of Happiness helps us to know where we come from and where we are going. This information is important to us to help motivate us to live the Gospel in this life and become the person we need to be, so we can once again live with our Father in Heaven. We are all imperfect and because of the mistakes you and I will make in this life, a Savior was provided to balance out the law of justice with the law of mercy. As we make mistakes, we must repent and because of the Savior&rsquo;s Atonement those sins can be washed clean.&nbsp; Because the Savior overcame death, and because He took upon himself the sins of the world, you and I have the opportunity to live with our Father in Heaven again if we so desire. Living the Gospel and becoming more like the Savior does bring joy and happiness to our lives. Just like returning home from school or a mission, we look forward to the time where we can return to live with our Father in Heaven. This brings a purpose to our lives and to the choices we make in this life. Just because we live the Gospel does not mean that we will always have joy and happiness in this life. There are times when we must pass through trials, tribulations, and sorrow, which can be very difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales in April 2012 Conference taught about the parable of the prodigal son and how he came to himself after he lost his inheritance and decided it would be better for him to be a servant for his father. Elder Hales teaches:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throughout our lives, whether in times of darkness, challenge, sorrow, or sin, we may feel the Holy Ghost reminding us that we are truly sons and daughters of a caring Heavenly Father, who loves us, and we may hunger for the sacred blessings that only He can provide. At these times we should strive to <em>come to ourselves</em> and come back into the light of our Savior&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>These blessings rightfully belong to all of Heavenly Father&rsquo;s children. Desiring these blessings, including a life of joy and happiness, is an essential part of Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan for each one of us. The prophet Alma taught, &ldquo;Even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you.&rdquo;(Alma 32:27)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our spiritual desires increase, we become spiritually self-reliant. How, then, do we help others, ourselves, and our families increase our desires to follow the Savior and live His gospel? How do we strengthen our desires to repent, become worthy, and endure to the end? How do we help our youth and young adults let these desires work in them until they are converted and become true &ldquo;saint[s] through the atonement of Christ&rdquo;? (Mosiah 3:19)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We become converted and spiritually self-reliant as we prayerfully live our covenants&mdash;through worthily partaking of the sacrament, being worthy of a temple recommend, and sacrificing to serve others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, I know that as we become spiritually self-reliant, you and I will be happy and in the end you and I will receive a fullness of joy. I also know that we will experience challenges in this life that will cause us pain and sorrow. There are many examples in the scriptures where righteous men and women had to endure difficult trials. I think of Nephi as he had to deal with Laman and Lemuel and their rebellion. In March 1839 Joseph Smith sat in Liberty Jail and received a revelation concerning the persecutions of the Saints and the trails they were dealing with at that time. Just like the Saints during Joseph&rsquo;s time, we can apply to our lives today what the Savior taught in Doctrine and Covenants section 123 verses 16 through 17:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16&nbsp;You know, brethren, that a very large ship is benefited very much by a very small helm in the time of a storm, by being kept workways with the wind and the waves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;17&nbsp;Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A helm is the tiller by which the ship is steered and compared to the boat itself, it comprises a very small portion of the boat. In a storm the helm of the boat becomes important because you want to keep the boat from going sideways to the waves. If the boat goes sideways to the waves the boat can be easily capsized and destroyed. If you and I do all that we can cheerfully even if the most severe storm is raging around us we can be assured that God is in control and we will see His arm revealed at those times. I testify that this is true. I testify also that as we attend the temple, live the Gospel, make our homes a sanctuary, and live the honor code and dress and grooming standards we become more like the Savior and we avoid the game trails that take us off the main trail of &ldquo;The Great Plan of Happiness&rdquo;. Living the Gospel brings joy to our lives even as we experience trials and sorrow and I testify of these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful and humbled to be with you today. As a representative of the Student Honor Office you will be happy and relieved to know that we will not be discussing skinny jeans today. In all seriousness, I feel a great responsibility in this invitation to speak to you today and pray that the Holy Ghost will be with me, as well as with each of you in our time together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the time we are very young we are taught that when we have trials in our lives we should pray and when needed, request a priesthood blessing and everything will be okay. I testify that this is true; however, today I want to discuss with you God&rsquo;s love for us when the &ldquo;everything will be okay&rdquo; answer to our prayers doesn&rsquo;t look like what we thought it should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I say we, I really mean we. I am including all of us in attendance here, and all those who have ever thought, &ldquo;this is not what I prayed for&rdquo;. Because things do not always turn out how we think they should. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bible Dictionary teaches that,<em> &ldquo;Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that it is often difficult to bring my will into correspondence with the will of the Father. When we pray and expect God to bring His will into correspondence with our will the Bible Dictionary teaches that these prayers will <em>&ldquo;remain unanswered because they are not in Christ&rsquo;s name at all; they in no way represent his mind, but spring out of the selfishness of man&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p>To bring our will into correspondence with God&rsquo;s will and avoid unanswered prayers during our times of trial; might I suggest five gospel principles that have given me perspective and helped me to understand Gods&rsquo; will and love for me during my times of trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, our purpose on earth is to be tried and tested. In Abraham chapter 3 verse 25, God teaches us as he taught Abraham, that the purpose of this life is to<em> &ldquo;prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;&rdquo;</em> Knowing that our purpose on earth is to be tested leads us to the conclusion that on this earth trials are inevitable.&nbsp; Helaman chapter 5 verse 12 clears up any remaining doubt. Here, Helaman explained this truth to his sons, Nephi and Lehi, when he counseled them by saying, <em>&ldquo;And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to briefly focus on some of the specific language Helaman used. Helaman did not say if the devil sends forth his mighty winds, his shafts and his mighty storms. He said when. If would imply some uncertainty of whether or not one would be tested in this life. Instead of using if, Helaman chose to use when. By using the word when Helaman leaves no doubt that the devil will send forth his winds, his shafts, his hail, and his mighty storm to test us. It is only a matter of when.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Doctrine and Covenants section 136 verse 31 we learn the reason why we must be tried and tested. Verse 31 teaches that the Lord&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion; and he that will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing that our purpose on this earth is to be tested gives us perspective during our trials and prepares us to receive the glory that God has in store for us. Painful as they may be, trials are necessary, but we were never meant to face them alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, trials help us draw nearer to God. In Hebrews chapter 12 verse 11 we are taught, <em>&ldquo;Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.&rdquo;</em> Defining chasten will help us understand what this scripture is trying to teach us. Webster&rsquo;s dictionary defines chasten as 1) correcting by punishment or suffering 2) pruning of excess, pretense or falsity 3) or causing to be more humble or restrained. Dictionary.com defines chasten as inflicting suffering upon for purposes of moral improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of which definition you choose trials are a method God uses to chasten us. He gives us trials to mold and shape us into what He wants us to be. Hebrews chapter 12 verse 6 reads <em>&ldquo;For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth&hellip;.&rdquo;</em> This teaches us that trials are an indication that God loves us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An excellent example of drawing nearer to God through trials was the prophet Joseph Smith.&nbsp; The trials Joseph Smith endured while a prisoner in the liberty jail caused him to call out to God and ask,<em>&ldquo;O God, where art thou?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye,&hellip; behold&hellip; the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants,&rdquo;</em> and finally, <em>&ldquo;how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions.&rdquo;</em><sup>1</sup> To which God answered saying &ldquo;<em>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high</em>;&rdquo;<sup>2</sup> and later in section 122 verse 7, &ldquo;<em>know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p>As we follow the example of the Prophet Joseph Smith and countless others our trials will draw us nearer to God. We will know for a certainty that He knows us individually and that He loves us. When we recognize these facts, even when we are being tried, we can be reassured of the third principle. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God will not test us beyond the limits He knows what we can bear, which I have found, is nearly always beyond what we are comfortable with. Because God loves us and wants us to draw nearer to Him he will not give us trials that exceed our ability to bear them. In First Corinthians Chapter 10 verse 13 we learn that <em>&ldquo;God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be [tried] above that ye are able; but will with the [trial] also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p>One example from the Book of Mormon that illustrates this principle well is the escape of the people of Alma from their bondage to the Lamanites found in the book of Mosiah. Here, the people of Alma found themselves in bondage to the Lamanites and some of wicked King Noah&rsquo;s high priests. The people of Alma were surrounded by the Lamanites and were subject to abuse and all manner of heavy burdens. Amulon and the other priests had been appointed to be the teachers over Alma and his people. They forbade the people of Alma from praying. Anyone who was caught praying was put to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the people of Alma were those people who had accepted Abinadi&rsquo;s message as Alma taught it to them and had been baptized. By all accounts they were faithfully striving to live the teachings of Alma as best they could and were certainly doing a better job of keeping God&rsquo;s commandments than their captors, yet they were brought into bondage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it is safe to say that the people of Alma were being sorely tested and that most if not all of them were outside of their comfort zones in bearing this trial. But God knew they could bear it. In this miserable state and under these circumstances the people of Alma &ldquo;<em>did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts.&rdquo;</em><sup>3</sup> As they secretly poured out their hearts to the Lord he answered their prayers not as they probably expected but in accordance with His will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Mosiah chapter 24 verse 14 the Lord told them<em> &ldquo;I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.&rdquo;</em> In verse 15 we read that the<em> &ldquo;burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.&rdquo;</em> Eventually, the people of Alma escaped their bondage when the<em>&ldquo;Lord caused a deep sleep to come upon the Lamanties, yea, and all their task-masters were in a profound sleep.&rdquo;</em><sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God knew these peoples&rsquo; limit to bear this burden. He had previously prepared them to bear it to a certain extent. When they had reached their limit, which was well beyond what they thought they could bear, God increased their ability to bear the burden of bondage to the point that they bore it with ease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like God knew these peoples&rsquo; limit He knows our limits and will not try us beyond what we can bear without providing a way for us to bear it. Through this method of proving and testing us God allows us the opportunity to unite with the Psalmist in saying<em> &ldquo;Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:&rdquo;</em><sup>5</sup> With His knowledge of us He prepares us to have the strength and fortitude to bear &ldquo;the mighty storms&rdquo; we will face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, the Fourth principle is that God prepares us to face our trials. I want to share with you how I learned and can testify of the goodness of God and the reality of our Savior&rsquo;s great atoning sacrifice on our behalf and how this carried me through a very difficult time in my life. It is really easy to be obedient when things are going well in the calm between the storms that represent the trials in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I distinctly recall one such moment of calm. It was a beautiful sunny fall afternoon and I was driving past our local golf course on the way to the grocery store.&nbsp; Our last child had recently been born, a daughter after four very active sons. At that moment I felt the love of Heaven so profoundly and felt blessed beyond description. It seemed nothing could go wrong; life was very, very good. As I reflect on that moment today I am grateful for the tender mercy of that moment and the pause it gave me to appreciate the goodness of a loving Heavenly Father. And the strength it gave me to face the approaching storm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the very beginning our four sons have given us a run for our money. They were and are as active and adventurous as you can imagine, it is all I have known and I have loved every minute of it. However; active and adventurous, for our family, go hand in hand with emergency rooms and urgent care centers, sometimes including a trip to each on the same day with the same son. A tetanus shot and glue in the afternoon at the urgent care center for laceration and surgery to repair a digital nerve at the emergency room in the evening. It was an interesting moment when the nurse asked when this son had received his last tetanus shot and I responded; four hours ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the urgent care opened in our community I may have been the only one thinking how much it would save us in emergency room costs. During, what we call our ER phase, we kept a running tally on how many days, weeks and finally months we were ER free. Before we stopped keeping track, the longest time between visits was four months. During this time we accumulated countless stitches, staples, broken arms, skull fractures, surgeries, hospitalizations, disease diagnoses, ambulance rides, and life flights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going to the ER became so routine that I knew when superglue could be used at home in lieu of stitches. In addition, as it turns out, being on a first name basis with the ER nurses and doctors can be valuable. To this day, my husband and I employ a sophisticated system to determine who &ldquo;gets&rdquo; to take the injured child to the emergency room. It is called Rock, Paper, Scissors. Loser goes. I can tell you that I win more than I lose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of these experiences we learned to navigate traumatic situations with our children, listen to the promptings of the spirit, witness miracles through the power of the priesthood, and embrace the life we have with our children.</p>
<p>I tell you this because these experiences helped form my foundation for what was to come. On February 15, 2005, around 4:00 in the afternoon I received a phone call from a dear friend. She said to me; Kristie, I hate to be the bearer of bad news; your husband and boys have been in an accident by our home. You need to come right away. I immediately prayed for the safety of my husband Eric, and our sons Jake and Tyson, who were all in the car. At that time Jake was 15, Tyson 12, Cody 9, Kade 7, and our daughter, Katelyn, was 5 months old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the phone call, I had taken our youngest son to a friend&rsquo;s house and our daughter was still in her car seat asleep. I put her in the car along with our 9 year-old son and drove the 2 short miles from our home to the scene of the accident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you drive south on this country road there is a small hill that blocks your view of the upcoming intersection.&nbsp; As we came over the hill we saw numerous emergency vehicles. I was quickly diverted to the ambulance that had our son, Tyson, in it. He, I was told, was the most critical. As soon as I got in the ambulance, I saw that our good friend, a paramedic, was working on him. I was relieved because of my confidence in his abilities. I knew Tyson needed a priesthood blessing and made arrangements for a family member to meet us at the hospital. I was allowed to ride in the ambulance with Tyson, and dear friends stepped in to care for our younger children. It&rsquo;s interesting what you remember at times like this; I remember being handed things from Tyson&rsquo;s pockets, notes from friends, his watch, and thinking these are such ordinary things for a time like this, but I needed them with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we arrived at the hospital, as you can imagine it was a scene of ordered chaos; I was again relieved to see doctors I knew from previous visits and that I had confidence in working on Eric, Jake, and Tyson. At some point in this chaos they were each given a priesthood blessing. Jake had been unconscious but was awake and concerned about Tyson and Eric. He sustained a broken bone on the top of his foot and a concussion. Eric was concerned about Jake and Tyson, but had significant injures that included three crushed vertebrae, a broken clavicle, a sternum that was cracked in six places, and a hip contusion. The injuries to his chest and back caused him a great deal of pain and impaired his breathing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tyson&rsquo;s injuries were critical. He was intubated on arrival at the hospital, and rushed for a CT scan. During the CT scan he coded. Our good friend, the same paramedic, started CPR and was able to get his heart beating again. I was grateful to be able to be by his side while other family members attended to Eric and Jake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CT showed that Tyson had sustained a shattered spleen, multiple liver lacerations, and bone fractures. He was immediately taken into surgery. His spleen was removed and his liver was packed in an attempt to stop the bleeding. It was determined he should be life-flighted to Primary Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. A priesthood blessing was administered before Tyson left. Arrangements were made and we were soon in Salt Lake City. Again, he was immediately taken into surgery. During the second surgery he coded multiple times and was resuscitated. I was able to be with him when he was brought into the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Tyson was given a priesthood blessing and had the best medical care that was available; including IV&rsquo;s, blood transfusions, platelets and clotting factors. None of this was able to stop the bleeding. His internal bleeding was so severe that it was impossible for the medical team to replace the blood he was losing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My husband was not able to accompany me to Salt Lake because his injuries were so significant. It was very difficult for him and for me to be separated. A family member stayed with him during the night and I will be forever grateful that they were there with him when I called to tell him that Tyson had died in the early morning hours; eleven hours and two surgeries after the accident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can tell you that this is not what I prayed for. As I was en route to Salt Lake City I remember thinking everything would be alright but I didn&rsquo;t know what side of &ldquo;alright&rdquo; I was going to be on. I of course, prayed for Tyson to be healed. I really wanted him to be able to show his friends the super cool scars he would have from the surgeries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Oaks taught, &ldquo;<em>We do all that we can for the healing of a loved one, and then we trust in the Lord for the outcome.&rdquo; </em>Our faith must be in the Lord and submit to His will and not what we think the outcome should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have the eternal perspective that our Father has; however, I trust him. There is great comfort in the words of Mormon found in Mormon chapter 5 verse 23, &ldquo;<em>know ye not that ye are in the hands of God?&rdquo;</em> and Doctrine and Covenants section 42 verse 48 <em>&ldquo;he that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed&rdquo;</em>. We do not know why Tyson&rsquo;s life on this earth was a short 12 and a half years but if we trust in God, we do not need to know everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was amazed out how quickly friends and family responded when they heard about the accident.&nbsp; In the Kimball Building on the second floor there is a plaque with a quote from President Kimball. It reads, &ldquo;<em>God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs." </em>I testify that this is true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God poured out many tender mercies upon me and my family in preparing us for this trial; I had experience with hospitals, doctors, and paramedics. I knew Tyson had received excellent medical care. I was able to talk to Tyson in the ambulance before he lost consciousness, family and friends quickly surrounded us, my younger brother was in medical school at the University of Utah; he along with other family members and friends were with Tyson when he arrived. His medical knowledge was a great comfort to me. Family and friends took care of Eric, Jake, Cody and Kade while I rushed to be with Tyson. Arrangements were made so I could fly to Salt Lake and be with Tyson and arrive shortly after he died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Tyson died, kindness was again extended to our family when this same individual arranged for my husband and sons to fly to Salt Lake to be with me and Katelyn. Looking back I am still humbled by the sacrifices family, friends, and others made on our behalf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the Fifth principle is that, stretching our limits through trials helps us grow. President Uchtdorf taught, &ldquo;<em>adversity teaches us things we cannot learn otherwise. Adversity helps to develop a depth of character that comes in no other way. Our loving Heavenly Father has set us in a world filled with challenges and trials so that we, through opposition, can learn wisdom, become stronger, and experience joy&hellip;.</em> <em>It is your reaction to adversity, not the adversity itself, that determines how your life&rsquo;s story will develop</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I would like to tell you that after Tyson&rsquo;s death, our family has had a reprieve from the trials of life.&nbsp; But that is not the purpose of our life on earth. Two months after Tyson died our son, Jake had a major surgery at Primary Children&rsquo;s with an intense recovery. Three months after that, we were on another life flight with our son Cody to Primary Children&rsquo;s. Again, we were met by family and a competent medical team. Cody was given a priesthood blessing and we witnessed a miracle. Challenges and trials continued to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was beginning to feel like I had a bull&rsquo;s eye on my back and wondered what I was doing wrong, what message was I not getting?&nbsp; I was beginning to lose hope. I thought I was trying my best, I was going to church, paying my tithing, praying&hellip;. As I was lamenting all these things, I thought of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the promise the Lord gave, <em>&ldquo;My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high&rdquo;</em><sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nine months after Tyson died we had the privilege to perform his sacred temple work. Words cannot describe the joy we felt in completing this final earthly ordinance for him that transcends this life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been nearly eight years since Tyson died. Our family continues to have challenges, trials, and adversity. We still have ER visits, surgeries, and hospitalizations. We seem to fall in that tricky less than 1% category. This last fall our son Kade had a routine ACL reconstruction and a meniscus repaired. As a result of that surgery he developed a joint infection. In order to eradicate the infection two additional surgeries were required to wash and clean the joint in addition, to 30 days of IV medication. Prior to the surgery my husband administered to Kade and in that blessing was a warning and a promise. Because of that blessing I was more vigilant in looking for any sign outside of the &ldquo;routine&rdquo;. We strive to embrace these trials and on occasion have seen humor and irony in the journey. During the daily trips for IV&rsquo;s, physical therapy, infectious disease appointments, and orthopedic appointments for Kade, He and I developed a relationship that may not have happened otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tyson remains a major part of our family. I testify that our trials are given to us because our Heavenly Father loves us and not because we have a bull&rsquo;s eye on our backs. Our purpose here on earth IS to be tested. Our trials can help us draw nearer to God if we choose to turn to Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God will not test us beyond the limits He knows we can bear, not the limits we are comfortable with. However, He helps prepare us for those trials and provides others to help us bear our burdens. I also testify that as painful as they may be, stretching our limits through trials helps us grow - helps me to know that God has not forsaken us nor will he. For He has said, &ldquo;<em>people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive the glory that I have for them.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p>I testify that Jesus is the Living Christ; He truly is the light, the life, and the hope of the world. I pray that each of us will embrace our trials and be as faithful as Job when he said,<em> &ldquo;But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold&rdquo;</em> <sup>7</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to focus today on 3 Nephi 18:18 which are the words of our Savior Himself: &ldquo;Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.&rdquo; He gives 3 specific admonitions that I wish to discuss in greater depth:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Satan Desires to Have Us That He May Sift Us As Wheat</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>What does it mean for Satan to &ldquo;have us&rdquo; and &ldquo;sift&rdquo; us &ldquo;as wheat&rdquo;? 2 Nephi 2:18 explains &ldquo;And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind.&rdquo; Elder M. Russell Ballard was very clear about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long before the world was formed, Satan and those who followed after him raged against the forces of good and tried to overthrow the work of God. That struggle has not ended, only shifted battlegrounds. It is ruthless and relentless, and the objective of the battle is your eternal soul and mine.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scriptures warn us often to be watchful because his influence is not trivial. 2 Nephi 9:28 states &ldquo;O that cunning plan of the evil one! &hellip;&rdquo; He will find our weaknesses and is very crafty at exploiting them. His methods are often very subtle as described in 2 Nephi 26:22 &ldquo;&hellip;yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Abraham 3:22-23, Abraham explains that he was shown the pre-mortal world and the &ldquo;noble and great ones&rdquo; who were there. They were foreordained and given specific missions to accomplish. The Lord said unto Abraham &ldquo;thou are one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born&rdquo;. It is very likely that you and I were among those &ldquo;noble and great ones&rdquo; and that we each have divinely appointed missions to accomplish here in this life. Just look in your patriarchal blessing for a glimpse of who you really are and what the Lord has foreordained you to do. The book True to the Faith explains this doctrine of Foreordination:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the&nbsp;pre-mortal spirit world,&nbsp;God&nbsp;appointed certain spirits to fulfill specific missions during their mortal lives. This is called foreordination. Foreordination does not guarantee that individuals will receive certain callings or responsibilities. Such opportunities come in this life as a result of the righteous exercise of&nbsp;agency&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hymn #240 highlights this principle:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know this, that every soul is free</p>
<p>To choose his life and what he&rsquo;ll be;</p>
<p>For this eternal truth is giv&rsquo;n:</p>
<p>That God will force no man to heav&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A quote attributed to Winston Churchill is very stirring:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To every man there comes&hellip; that special moment when he is figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a special thing unique to him and fitted to his talent. What a tragedy if that moment finds him unprepared or unqualified for the work which would be his finest hour.&rdquo;<sup>3 </sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider Oliver Cowdery and Hyrum Smith &ndash; two individuals who were certainly among the &ldquo;noble and great ones&rdquo; and foreordained to divine missions. Oliver participated in nearly every key event in early church history. &ldquo;[He] was &hellip; called of God [as] an apostle of Jesus Christ &hellip; [and] to be the second elder of this church&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;He was considered co-president with Joseph. In a revelation given in 1830 Oliver was given a personal warning &ldquo;Behold, I speak unto you, Oliver, a few words. Behold, thou art blessed, and art under no condemnation. But beware of pride, lest thou shouldst enter into temptation.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup> My heart groans to learn of the tragedy that occurred 8 years later. He allowed pride to creep in and during a very difficult time in church history became offended and critical to the extent that he was excommunicated from the church. He continued to hold to his pride and offense as he waited 10 years before returning and being re-baptized - waiting for -quote-&ldquo;someone [to] step forward ... to vindicate [my] character,&rdquo; as stated in a letter he wrote to David Whitmer.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hyrum, on the other hand never faltered. He was content to be faithful in the background, requiring no honor or prestige, and persevering with faith through every difficulty. Here is what Joseph said of his bother Hyrum &ldquo;I could pray in my heart that all my brethren were like unto my beloved brother Hyrum, for truly he possesses the mildness of a Lamb, and the integrity of a Job; and in short the meek and quiet spirit, of Jesus&nbsp;Christ&rdquo;<sup>7</sup>. The Lord said by revelation &ldquo;Blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>8</sup>. Nearly 3 years after Oliver&rsquo;s excommunication Hyrum, by revelation, is given Oliver&rsquo;s mission and blessing &ldquo;That he [Hyrum] &hellip; be crowned with the same blessing, and glory, and honor, and priesthood, and gifts of the priesthood, that once were put upon him that was my servant Oliver&nbsp;Cowdery.&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of David who defeated Goliath. He was certainly among the &ldquo;noble and great ones&rdquo; foreordained to a divine mission. My heart trembles to see David succumbing to progressively serious temptations: first by not being where he was supposed to be; then walking out on his roof top and allowing himself to look at the beautiful Bathsheba; then enquiring after her; then sending for her, then committing adultery with her, then seeking to hide his sin by sending for her husband to come home from battle, and finally having Uriah treacherously killed.&nbsp; The same person who faced Goliath with faith and courage allowed himself to be lead &ldquo;by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he was [bound with a] strong cord forever&rdquo;<sup>10</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrast King David with Joseph sold as a slave to Potiphar. Potiphar&rsquo;s wife tries to seduce him on multiple occasions. &ldquo;And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph&nbsp;day&nbsp;by day, that he hearkened not unto her&hellip;&nbsp;or&nbsp;to be with her.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup> Joseph recognized the &ldquo;flaxen cords&rdquo; and when he accidentally enters the house and finds he is alone with Potiphar&rsquo;s wife &ldquo;he&hellip;fled, and got him out.&rdquo;<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My heart yearns for the day when I can stand before my Savior and hear Him say to me &ldquo;Well done, thou good and faithful servant...&rdquo;<sup>13</sup> With all my heart I want to be a Hyrum Smith or a Joseph in Egypt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Always be Watchful</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>To watch means to be alert and on the lookout, to be careful or cautious, to remain vigilant. 1 Thessalonians 5:6 states &ldquo;Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.&rdquo; Mosiah 4:30 clarifies &ldquo;But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds&hellip; ye must perish&hellip;&rdquo; The scriptures are clear that the responsibility of avoiding and resisting temptation is ours. Doctrine and Covenants 58:28 affirms &ldquo;For the&nbsp;power&nbsp;is in them, wherein they are&nbsp;agents&nbsp;unto themselves.&rdquo; The verses before and after this provide some additional insight into what it means to have the power within us. &ldquo;Verily I say, men should be&nbsp;anxiously&nbsp;engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; &hellip;he that&nbsp;doeth&nbsp;not anything until he is commanded&hellip; and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is&nbsp;damned.&rdquo;<sup>14</sup> In other words, being watchful means not waiting to be commanded in everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you are viewing things you shouldn&rsquo;t just because no one has specifically said &ldquo;Thou shalt not watch such-and-such&rdquo;. Perhaps you are eating or drinking things that are harmful just because no one has specifically said &ldquo;Thou shalt not eat or drink such and such&rdquo;. Those who are watchful hold themselves to high standards based on the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. They listen to warnings from prophets and make personal quiet changes to conform knowing that these warnings are how &ndash; quote- &ldquo;the hen gathereth her chickens under her wings&rdquo; for protection.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hymn 240 teaches us how the Lord provides such protection:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll call, persuade, direct aright,</p>
<p>And bless with wisdom, love, and light,</p>
<p>In nameless ways be good and kind,</p>
<p>But never force the human mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an example of how the Lord warns without &ldquo;commanding in all things&rdquo;, listen to this warning from Elder David A. Bednar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I raise an apostolic voice of warning about the potentially stifling, suffocating, suppressing, and constraining impact of some kinds of cyberspace&hellip; experiences upon our souls. The concerns I raise are not new; they apply equally to other types of media, such as television, movies, and music&hellip; Sadly, some young men and young women in the Church today&hellip; neglect eternal relationships for digital distractions&hellip; that have no lasting value. My heart aches when a young couple&mdash;sealed together in the house of the Lord for time and for all eternity by the power of the holy priesthood&mdash;experiences marital difficulties because of the addicting effect of excessive video gaming or online socializing.&rdquo;<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that he does not list specific dos and don&rsquo;ts nor does he stipulate a particular rating that is &ldquo;OK&rdquo; or a certain number of hours per week that are appropriate; but rather warns in a clear way allowing us to take initiative &ndash; to act for ourselves. Are you being &ldquo;watchful&rdquo; and heeding his warning?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very likely that your patriarchal blessing includes specific warnings given to you personally. These warnings usually refrain from specific do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts allowing the growth that occurs when one is proactive without being commanded in all things. Are you treating these warnings solemnly and being especially &ldquo;watchful&rdquo; in the areas emphasized in your patriarchal blessing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another scripture that teaches us how to be &ldquo;watchful&rdquo; is 1 Nephi 15:24 &ldquo;And I said unto them that&hellip; whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.&rdquo; Do you discipline yourself and study the scriptures consistently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 12 years ago while living in the Detroit area and employed in the auto industry I was asked to take a business trip to Las Vegas. Our firm developed fuel pumps and had contracted with a taxi company to test prototypes &ndash; a great way to accumulate high miles in a short amount of time. The pumps had been installed in several taxis and needed to be removed and brought back for analysis. I was to be accompanied by two other employees of our company whom I had never met. We would spend 3 days working from about midnight until 6 or 7 am -- the hours when the taxis were least likely to be on the road. As I prepared for this trip a coworker commented to me about the vulgar nature of the two I would be traveling with. The Holy Ghost made a deep impression on me that I should beware -- that satan would use this opportunity to tempt me. The feeling was so poignant that I considered refusing to take the trip.&nbsp; As the trip grew nearer I decided to talk to my bishop about it. He expressed confidence in me and advised me to take the trip but to follow promptings about precautions I should take. I told the Lord in prayer that I wanted to return with honor to my family and asked him to inspire and help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the trip began it was clear that the individuals I was with were truly vulgar and immoral. Since we only had one rental car to share between us I decided not to accompany them to restaurants because I was certain they would go places that were inappropriate. Instead, I said &ldquo;no thank you&rdquo; to their invitations and stayed in the hotel and ordered room service. The maintenance bays at the cab company where we worked were littered with pornographic leaflets. I had previously committed to myself that I would not even glance at them. Since we were limited to working from midnight to 7 am we had a lot of free time. I even felt that I should not turn on the television in the hotel even though it appeared that the trip would result in 3 days of boredom. Instead I retreated to the haven of The Book of Mormon for hours each day. At the end of the trip my soul was soaring like an eagle and I returned to my family with honor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Always be Prayerful</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>As I studied this aspect I was astonished at how many scriptures exhort us to pray to be protected from temptation. Here are a few:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is clear that we need to be disciplined and consistent in our personal prayers. We are commanded to pray &ldquo;morning, midday, and evening&rdquo;<sup>17</sup> and to always have a prayer in our hearts. If there was ever something that we must not neglect it is consistent personal prayer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ere you left your room this morning did you think to pray?&rdquo;<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only do these scriptures teach us to pray often and consistently, they also teach us that we should pray specifically about being protected against temptation. Although our own &ldquo;watchfulness&rdquo; is crucial, it is not sufficient. 1 Nephi 10:6 teaches &ldquo;Wherefore, all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and ever would be save they should&nbsp;rely&nbsp;on this Redeemer.&rdquo; We are often taught in the church about the need to be cleansed from sin. I don&rsquo;t think we understand completely what that means. Clearly it means that we need to be cleansed from previous sins and be forgiven of them. But it means more than that. It means that our natures must be changed so that we are less and less likely to sin in the future until our entire self has been transformed. Mosiah 5:2 states &ldquo;&hellip; the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, &hellip; has wrought a mighty change in us, &hellip; that we have no more&nbsp;disposition&nbsp;to do evil, but to do good continually.&rdquo; Here is how Elder David A. Bednar explains it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of us know that when we do wrong things, we need help to overcome the effects of sin in our lives. The Savior has paid the price and made it possible for us to become clean through His redeeming power. Most of us clearly understand that the Atonement is for sinners. I am not so sure, however, that we know and understand that the Atonement is also for &hellip; good men and women who are obedient, worthy, and conscientious and who are striving to become better&hellip; We may mistakenly believe we must make the journey from good to better and become a saint all by ourselves &hellip; Individual willpower, personal determination and motivation, effective planning and goal setting are necessary but ultimately insufficient ... Truly, we must come to rely upon &ldquo;the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah&rdquo; - 2Nephi&nbsp;2:8.&rdquo;<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ether 12:27 teaches &ldquo;And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to share a personal experience from my life that illustrates this principle. In my early youth, pride and peer influence began creeping into my life as it does with many adolescents. I began to take offense easily and was quick to anger. In the 1980&rsquo;s the phrase &ldquo;burn&rsquo;d ya&rdquo; was a way to shown how clever you were at putting others down in a way that made them feel frazzled and unable to defend themselves against your clever criticism. Being good at &ldquo;burning&rdquo; people fed one&rsquo;s pride and served to build an increasingly rebellious nature. I succumbed to these temptations and at times responded in hurtful ways to my parents and siblings. Despite this great weakness, I had developed a pattern of consistent personal scripture study and prayer which allowed the Holy Ghost to prick my conscience often. Each time I would get angry and arrogant I would feel disappointed in myself. I finally vowed with intense personal commitment that I would quit it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overcoming this weakness, however, was not that easy. Day after day I would try to control my anger by sheer will power. Day after day I would falter. My personal prayers began to include petitions to the Lord to help me with this weakness and these petitions became more and more sincere as they continued for perhaps 3 or even 4 years. By the time I was approaching 16 years of age I still hadn&rsquo;t completely overcome this weakness. Sure I had made some progress but came to the frightening realization that although I was doing my very best it just wasn&rsquo;t enough. I began feeling helpless against this obstacle and knew that it stood in the way of my exaltation. My prayers then began sincerely acknowledging that I just couldn&rsquo;t fix it and that I desperately needed his help. I humbly began asking for a miracle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What occurred throughout the next months happened quietly and almost imperceptibly until one day I was in a situation that normally would have offended me and made me angry. I recall saying to myself &ldquo;Wow, I don&rsquo;t feel offended or angry at all&rdquo;. When this continued month after month I realized that a miracle had occurred for me. Not only did I not get angry but I had become very patient -- my weakness had been turned into a strength. I humbly witness to you that it was the grace of my Savior that performed this transformation. I testify that &ldquo;it is by&nbsp;grace&nbsp;that we are&nbsp;saved, after all we can&nbsp;do.&rdquo;<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helaman 5:12 &ldquo;&hellip; remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The words of the Hymn &ldquo;Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing&rdquo; reveals the prayer that is in my heart:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>O to grace how great a debtor</p>
<p>daily I'm constrained to be!</p>
<p>Let thy goodness, like a fetter,</p>
<p>bind my wandering heart to thee.</p>
<p>Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,</p>
<p>prone to leave the God I love;</p>
<p>here's my heart, O take and seal it,</p>
<p>seal it for thy courts above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear Brothers and Sisters, it is a great privilege to be with you and to address you this afternoon. It is also a great responsibility, and I pray for the guidance of the Holy Ghost that we all may be edified during this hour together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a young man or woman in the church reaches the age of eight, it is their opportunity to enter the waters of baptism and become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Baptisms are celebratory events, and are eagerly anticipated. After the baptism, however, there is a second ordinance that is performed, one, which often receives much less attention. In this ordinance, a newly baptized person is confirmed a member of the Church and, significantly, is given an instruction that is a wonderful invitation: &ldquo;Receive the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost is &ldquo;the unspeakable gift.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;It is the right to receive the Holy Ghost as a constant companion. However, it does not mean that the Holy Ghost is automatically with us every moment of our lives following confirmation. It is a gift that must be sought after, cultivated, and merited by obedience to the commandments of God and personal worthiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April Conference 2010, President Packer gave a landmark address on the Priesthood, and suggested that, while the authority of the priesthood had been widely distributed, the power of the priesthood has not kept pace.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;I think that the same could be said of the gift of the Holy Ghost. It is widely distributed; every confirmed member of the Church has been given the right to enjoy this gift. But because its enjoyment is predicated on obedience to the commandments, I think the gift is not as fully used as it could be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin said it this way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear that some members of the Lord&rsquo;s Church &ldquo;live far beneath our privileges&rdquo; with regard to the gift of the Holy Ghost.<sup>&nbsp; </sup>Some are distracted by the things of the world that block out the influence of the Holy Ghost, preventing them from recognizing spiritual promptings&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some are spiritually deadened and past feeling because of their choices to commit sin. Others simply hover in spiritual complacency with no desire to rise above themselves and commune with the Infinite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they would open their hearts to the refining influence of this unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, a glorious new spiritual dimension would come to light. Their eyes would gaze upon a vista scarcely imaginable. They could know for themselves things of the Spirit that are choice, precious, and capable of enlarging the soul, expanding the mind, and filling the heart with inexpressible joy.<sup>3</sup>&ldquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of my address today is to suggest ways that we as students and scholars might more fully utilize the gift of the Holy Ghost in our lives &ndash; specifically in our quest to gain learning, knowledge, and understanding while in this remarkable university setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost is a teacher and testifier of truth. All missionaries are familiar with this passage from the final pages of the Book of Mormon:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then this telling declaration: &ldquo;And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In context, this passage refers to receiving a witness of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. But that final verse teaches us that the Holy Ghost conveys the truth of <em>all</em> things &ndash; &ldquo;things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms&hellip;.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider these words from the Gospel of John: &ldquo;But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma, in teaching the saints in Zarahemla, declared, &ldquo;Now the Spirit knoweth all things&hellip;&rdquo;,<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;and Ammon, in teaching King Lamoni, taught that &ldquo;a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge, and also power according to my faith and desires which are in God.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my favorite teachings about the ministry of the Holy Ghost comes from Parley P. Pratt, one of the first apostles of this dispensation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gift of the Holy Ghost...quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands, and purifies all the natural passions and affections, and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use. It inspires, develops, cultivates, and matures all the fine-toned sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings, and affections of our nature. It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness, and charity. It develops beauty of person, form, and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation, and social feeling. It invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.&rdquo;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, the Holy Ghost is a desirable companion in our quest for all knowledge&nbsp; - both sacred as well as secular. However, we would do well to remember that the influence and voice of the Spirit is still and small, and that he must be invited into our lives in order to minister to us. Remember the injunction at our confirmation: Receive the Holy Ghost! <em>We</em> must be obedient, shutting out anything in our lives that would offend the Spirit, and then carefully and actively listen for his gentle guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would now like to share some basic principles that, if followed, will invite the Spirit to help us as we &ldquo;seek learning, even by study and also by faith.&rdquo;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;None of these principles will new to you; however, they are worth remembering and implementing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principle 1: Seek Learning </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord taught the early Saints:&nbsp; &ldquo;And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we can learn anything, we have to believe that learning is important! We have to hunger and thirst after knowledge. Effective learning requires the prerequisite of desire. We must realize the importance of learning as one of the purposes of mortality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Hinckley taught, &ldquo;This is a time of great opportunity that you will never have again as long as you live. Make the most of it right now. What a wonderful thing to go and learn of all the accumulated knowledge of all of the centuries of time. Take advantage of every opportunity that you have because the Lord has laid upon you a mandate through revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith concerning not only spiritual learning but secular learning. Yours is the responsibility, and you can&rsquo;t afford to waste your time. There is so much to learn. Be smart. Give it the very best you have.&rdquo;<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brigham Young has declared, &ldquo;The religion embraced by the Latter-day Saints, if only slightly understood, prompts them to search diligently after knowledge. There is no other people in existence more eager to see, hear, learn, and understand truth. Put forth your ability to learn as fast as you can, and gather all the strength of mind and principle of faith you possibly can, and then distribute your knowledge to the people.&rdquo;<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To seek after learning requires a believing heart and an open mind. Part of a university education involves examining ones prejudices and assumptions and setting them aside when necessary. It involves learning ideas never before considered, and often raises more questions than it answers. It <em>is</em> unsettling to discover that the world doesn&rsquo;t always work the way we thought it does. Don&rsquo;t automatically hold on to old ways of thinking and shy away from new information!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider these scriptures that illustrate the roadblock that an unbelieving heart can raise against the light of learning:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mosiah 8:20: O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mosiah 26:3: And now because of their unbelief they could not understand the word of God; and their hearts were hardened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants 93:39: And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, please do not be unbelieving! Seek learning with open minds and hearts. Be willing to learn new things in new ways. Be willing to acknowledge that we don&rsquo;t know everything. Often, the things we reject as wrong seem so only because we don&rsquo;t understand the laws upon which they are built and the premises upon which they operate.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the classes that I teach examines the theory behind 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> century music. There is always resistance at the beginning of the semester to the music as it is introduced because it sounds so weird. In the minds of students, because the music is not organized around the major-minor tonal system so familiar to us, it is considered not worthy of study &ndash; or worse &ndash; it is branded as somehow &ldquo;evil.&rdquo; But once the students understand the theory behind the music &ndash; the way it is constructed &ndash; the music suddenly makes sense, and becomes listenable (sometimes even enjoyable)! Seeking learning with an open, eager mind enables learning, and enables the Holy Ghost to direct and validate that which we learn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Put First things First </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our learning, both the sacred and the secular are important and divinely mandated. However, it is important to keep an eternal perspective on what knowledge is truly important to our eternal salvation, and to put that learning first. President Kimball taught this best:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Youth, beloved youth, can you see why we must let spiritual training take first place? Can you see that the spiritual knowledge may be complemented with the secular in this life and on for eternities but that the secular without the foundation of the spiritual is but like the foam upon the milk, the fleeting shadow?</p>
<p>"Do not be deceived! One need not choose between the two but only as to the sequence, for there is opportunity for one to get both simultaneously; but can you see that the seminary courses should be given even preferential attention over the high school subjects; the institute over the college course; the study of the scriptures ahead of the study of man-written texts?</p>
<p>"Can you see that the ordinances of the temple are more important than the PhD or any and all other academic degrees?"<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a reason why religion classes are so central to the curriculum at this university and why Church attendance and participation is expected. These are essential for keeping a proper balance; for putting God and his kingdom first in our lives. With this foundation securely in place, we can then learn all else the Lord desires us to learn, with the Holy Ghost facilitating that learning because we have our spiritual priorities straight!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3: Care for your Physical Body</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of our coming into mortality is to obtain a physical body.</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer has taught that &ldquo;our physical body is the instrument of our spirit.&rdquo;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;It is the physical body that allows us to act as learners, and not merely to be acted upon.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;As we act in the learning process, and then act on what we have learned, we will gain additional understanding.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to optimize the power of our physical bodies in the learning process, we must care for them. This is what the Word of Wisdom is about. This great revelation teaches us to avoid those things that harm the body (for example, alcohol and tobacco) and to use those things that are good for the body in moderation (herbs and fruits in the season thereof, etc). And then comes a remarkable promise:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</p>
<p>&nbsp;And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</p>
<p>&nbsp;And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.&rdquo;<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a marvelous blessing! Not only are we promised physical health, but intellectual health as well. Wisdom and great treasures of knowledge are the rewards of obedience to the commandments!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many suggestions that could be made here. Clearly, abstaining from tobacco, alcohol, coffee, tea, and illegal drugs of any kind is essential for all Latter-day Saints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proper nutrition is also important. May I suggest that the best nutrition comes from eating real food; that is, food that has not been overly processed, laden with preservatives, or manufactured from chemicals. The revelation mentions herbs and fruits, grain and meat. Twinkies and Snickers are not staples in this plan! Learn to prepare and eat real food; your body and mind will thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider this apparently hidden scripture in Doctrine and Covenants 88:124:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eight hours of sleep between 1 and 9 AM is not the same as eight hours of sleep between 10 PM and 6 AM! The later I go to bed at night, the less invigorated I am the next day &ndash; just like the Lord said!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proper rest is essential for the mind and body to function properly.&nbsp; I find that ideas flow more freely in the morning hours; I get far more out of scripture study when it happens early in my day rather than in the evenings.&nbsp; The Lord says, &ldquo;He that seeketh me early shall find me, and shall not be forsaken.&rdquo;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;So, get up early! Study early! Seek the Lord early!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exercise is also essential to our physical and mental well-being. If the Word of Wisdom promises that we shall &ldquo;run and not be weary, and walk and not faint,&rdquo;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;that suggests then that running and walking are desirable things to do. There exists a myriad of opportunity to participate in physical activities of all types and levels on this campus. When I see cars pull out of Sunrise apartments and pull into the Snow lot (they are across the street from each other) &ndash; it causes me to wonder! Do your bodies and minds a favor and get moving!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principle 4: Dig Deeply</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given our divine mandate to learn all we can about both spiritual and secular matters, it is important to make that learning count! Dig deeply in your quest for knowledge and work hard to make it your own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible for a student to read a chapter, attend class and even take some notes without actually learning much. Now, of course, reading textbooks, attending class and taking notes are essential. But the more important issues are: how much have I learned? Do I understand what I have read, heard or written? Could I teach this material to another person if called upon to do so?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Monson has counseled:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In academic preparation, I found it a good practice to read a text with the idea that I would be asked to explain that which the author wrote and its application to the subject it covered. Also, I tried to be attentive in any lecture in the classroom and to pretend that I would be called upon to present the same lecture to others. While this practice is very hard work, it certainly helps during test week!&rdquo;<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is easy to go through the motions; it is harder to actually dig into the material and master it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found an analogy that is helpful in demonstrating the value and importance of thorough academic work, and it has to do with construction. Now, I am hardly an expert on construction management, but in the eight years that I have lived in Rexburg, I have seen many buildings built from the ground up, including most recently the BYU-Idaho Center and the Rexburg Temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In every instance, there is a festive groundbreaking, where speeches are given, prayers are offered, and an artist&rsquo;s rendering of the completed structure is displayed. There is a great sense of excitement and anticipation for the building that is to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then an interesting thing happens: seemingly nothing!&nbsp; At least, it <em>appears</em> that nothing happens. But work is going on. Rocks and debris are cleared; the land is smoothed and graded. Trenches are dug deeply. Rock is sometimes blasted out, and then wooden planks are lowered into the trenches. It is hot, dusty, dirty, messy work. It is unglamorous, and bears little resemblance to what the final product will look like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the wooden forms are in place, then concrete is poured into the forms and the foundation is laid. Once the concrete has cured, the forms are removed and then repositioned to form the foundation walls. Concrete is again poured and cured to form the foundation walls. This takes a long time, and happens under ground level, out of sight. Up on the surface, it looks as if the project has stalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not until this preliminary foundation work has been laid does the form of the building begin to take shape. First, structural steel is anchored to the foundation walls, outer walls go up, a roof goes on, and we begin to see the result of all of the preparatory work. At this point, the project moves quickly with windows and doors, siding and landscaping, and the building looks much as it did in the artists&rsquo; conceptualization. When the building is completed, it is dedicated and put to use. If the preparation work was done carefully and correctly, the building will stand solidly for many, many years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is much the same way with a musician learning a new piece of music. Initially the student is excited to learn a new piece and be able to play it like the masters. &nbsp;But first there is real work that needs to take place. Hours upon hours of time must be devoted each day to the process of learning the piece. Fingering must be written into the score; bowings, phrasings, articulations must all be determined and practiced. Left hand, right hand, and (in the case of organists) feet need to be coordinated. Like laying the foundation of a building, this is very slow, tedious, time-consuming work that is done out of sight in the practice room. It is not at all glamorous or particularly exciting. It <em>is</em> very exacting labor. But eventually patterns and scale figurations are learned, the piece eventually comes together, and, if the preparation was adequate, it can be polished to performance standard relatively easily. The better and more thorough the preparation, the better the final performance will be, and the longer the piece of music will stay with the performer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same is true with all learning. When we enroll in a new class and attend on the first day of the semester, there is (hopefully) excitement in the air. We look forward with anticipation to the process of learning a specific skill or subject and long for the day at the end of the course when we will have mastered the requirements of the curriculum. But in between these two points is where real work must happen. The textbook must be read, notes taken and understood, class and group discussions prepared for. Time is spent in the library and research begins for papers. It can be tedious and is time consuming. But if this action is undertaken with discipline and enjoyment &ndash; if the student digs in deeply with dedication &ndash; then the Holy Ghost is more apt to join the process and true, deep learning can occur. I encourage all of us to dig deeply into our studies to make them a part of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principle 5: Live the Gospel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it significant that in the verses immediately preceding his instructions to &ldquo;teach one another, and seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom,&rdquo;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;the Lord tells the early saints that &ldquo;you must assemble yourselves together, and organize yourselves, and prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean&hellip;.&rdquo;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Only then are we ready to receive knowledge through the power of the Holy Ghost. Spiritual preparation precedes this spiritual power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph Smith taught that &ldquo;Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his <em>diligence</em><em> and obedience</em> than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.&rdquo;<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you see how the Honor Code at BYU-Idaho is a blessing to all of us as we embark on our divinely-mandated task of teaching and learning? The Honor Code helps us to be obedient; to keep our covenants; and prepares us for the ministration of the Holy Ghost as we seek learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a temple in our midst is also a great blessing to us. Temple worship draws us closer to the influence of the Holy Spirit, for it is a source of divine light and power. Light and truth obtained in the temple forsake the evil one<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;and help <em>us </em>forsake the evil one as well, thereby increasing our communion with the Spirit. Attend the temple as often as possible to serve, to learn, and to access the power of Heaven in your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to reference two stories that illustrate the power of the Spirit as a teacher. One comes from a living Apostle, the other from early Church history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the April 2003 General Conference, Elder Russell M. Nelson related an experience he had regarding his work as a heart surgeon in pioneering a new surgical technique. He used the illustration as an example of the power of prayer (which it is). However, I commend it to you as an example of how proper academic and spiritual preparation can allow the Spirit to teach us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Nelson&rsquo;s patient had two faulty heart valves. While one could be helped surgically, the other could not. An operation was not advised, but the patient persisted: &ldquo;Dr. Nelson, I have prayed for help and have been directed to you. The Lord will not reveal to me <em>how</em> to repair that second valve, but He can reveal it to you. Your mind is so prepared. If you will operate upon me, the Lord will make it known to you what to do. Please perform the operation that <em>I</em> need, and pray for the help that <em>you</em> need.&rdquo;<sup> </sup></p>
<p><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>After fervent prayer, Dr. Nelson agreed to operate, even without knowing what he would be able to do. However, during the surgery, impressions on how to solve the leaky valve were impressed upon his mind. Then a picture came to view, showing how stitches could be placed to accomplish the desired objective. The repair was completed according to the diagram shown to Elder Nelson&rsquo;s mind, and the operation was a success. Notice that Elder Nelson had prepared himself spiritually as well as academically, and then acted in faith. Then came the revelation on how to help his patient.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second story comes from Amanda Smith, a pioneer who traveled from Kirtland to Missouri. While at Haun&rsquo;s Mill, mobs attacked the Saints settled there, and Amanda Smith&rsquo;s husband and one of her sons were killed. Her youngest son, Alma, was wounded by the gunfire, and his entire hip joint had been shot away. His mother did not know what to do; all around her were only dead or dying men and lamenting women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In anguish of spirit, she prayed, "Oh my Heavenly Father, what shall I do? Thou seest my poor wounded boy and knowest my inexperience. Oh, Heavenly Father, direct me what to do!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then a voice spoke to her and directed her to take ashes from the fire, make a lye and put it directly into the wound. She was then directed to make a slippery-elm poultice for the wound &ldquo;as distinctly as though a physician had been standing by speaking to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pouring balsam into the wound, Amanda asked her son, "Alma, my child, you believe that the Lord made your hip?" "Yes, mother." "Well, the Lord can make something there in the place of your hip, don't you believe he can, Alma?" "Do you think that the Lord can, mother?" inquired the child, in his simplicity. "Yes, my son," I replied, "he has showed it all to me in a vision."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After five weeks, Alma was miraculously recovered &ndash; a living testament of the power of God to heal; and of the power of the Holy Ghost to teach a grieving but determined mother how to care for her child.<sup>28</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Nephi closed his record, he gave this instruction: &ldquo;If ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.&rdquo; (2 Ne. 32:3, 5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and Sisters, may we not neglect this gift that is with us! I testify that the Holy Ghost is real, and that he is a testifier and teacher of truth. He can and will teach each of us all we need to know if we will but access his power in our lives. Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, Thomas S. Monson is his prophet on the earth today. I know these things are true, and pray that we may all more fully turn to the Holy Ghost to guide us in our journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

</p>
<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today at the beginning of a new semester on another great day at BYU-Idaho. Sister Clark and I love you very much. I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every Monday night, Sister Clark and I meet with one or two of your wards for home evening. We love these opportunities to get to know you better, and we are inspired by your questions! They indicate your goodness and faith, especially in times of trial. Here are two examples, from one home evening, of the kinds of trials you face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life on the strait and narrow path is full of trials. Some come from affliction. Some, like pride, come from prosperity. Times of trial are like turning points in our lives, when we are vulnerable to temptation and yet open to deeper faith and greater hope and love. This is our mortal probation.&nbsp; It is meant to be a time of trial and testing and a time of learning and spiritual growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi taught us the way forward through the trials we face to the spiritual growth and learning essential to exaltation and eternal life:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, ye must press forward with steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In every trial in our lives, the way forward is always faith and hope in the Lord Jesus Christ and His pure and perfect love. If we choose Christ and the way of faith, hope, and charity, the Lord will bless us with the spiritual gifts and guidance we need to overcome our trials and become more and more like Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith, hope, and charity are spiritual gifts we both receive and develop. They bring us to Christ, the fountain of all righteousness.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;He is the only way to be &ldquo;more than conquerors&rdquo;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of the trials we face. Being &ldquo;more than conquerors&rdquo;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;in times of trial is a lot more than just gritting our teeth and hanging on. The Lord wants us to press forward with faith and hope in Him and with His love so that we overcome our trials and learn and grow spiritually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter where we are now in our spiritual journey, each one of us needs to grow in faith, hope, and charity. As Elder Russell M. Nelson taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do we need such resilient faith? Because difficult days are ahead. Rarely in the future will it be easy or popular to be a faithful Latter-day Saint. Each of us will be tested. The Apostle Paul warned that in the latter days, those who diligently follow the Lord &ldquo;shall suffer persecution.&rdquo; That very persecution can either crush you into silent weakness or motivate you to be more exemplary and courageous in your daily lives.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, whatever has been sufficient for us to overcome the trials we already have faced will not be sufficient for what is coming. Our great challenge is to qualify for the gifts of stronger faith, increased hope, and growth in the pure love of Christ to help us overcome and endure well the trials that lie ahead. That challenge is the focus of my talk today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I begin with a parable that illuminates the power of faith and hope in Christ and His pure love in overcoming trials in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Nursery Leader</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>A certain sister was called as the nursery leader in her ward. She was well-trained in child development and had many ideas for activities and crafts the children could make. She decided to make the nursery a showcase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After many weeks, the sister was discouraged. Nursery was a burden. She dreaded facing the children. Despite her plans, the children fussed and cried every week. Nothing she tried worked well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In frustration she cried out: &ldquo;I have done my best; what more can I do?&rdquo; A thought came into her mind: &ldquo;Ask Heavenly Father.&rdquo; Wiping away her tears, she knelt in prayer. She prayed about the nursery&mdash;her hopes, her frustration, and her disappointment. She prayed for His help and guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heavenly Father answered her prayer. She was impressed with the thought that her focus needed to change. The Lord taught her she needed to focus on the children&mdash;learn to know them and love them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sister knew she had to repent. She needed a new attitude and a new approach to the nursery. She prayed for forgiveness of her pride, her reliance on the arm of flesh, and her attitude toward the children. She sought inspiration from the scriptures asking herself: &ldquo;What would Jesus do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the sister went to the nursery the next Sunday, she had new hope. She did not know all that she would need to do, but she trusted the Lord. Rather than setting up when the children arrived, she met them at the door with a personalized greeting. Some of the children cried and fussed, but there was a different feeling in the nursery that week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Little by little as the sister got to know the children better, her feelings about them changed. She looked forward to Sundays. She was excited and happy to be with her nursery kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, inspiration came. One week she took a camera to nursery and took each child&rsquo;s picture.&nbsp; She prepared a picture board, mounted each child&rsquo;s picture on the board, and took the board to nursery every week. The children loved seeing themselves on the board. They not only felt important, they felt loved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a time, the children loved nursery so much they would run to nursery after sacrament meeting. The children loved being in the nursery, and the sister loved them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Patterns for Growth in Faith, Hope, and Charity</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>The parable of the nursery leader has much to teach us about overcoming trials and growing in faith, hope, and charity. I want to focus today on three patterns of action from the parable we can apply in our daily lives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Feast on the Words of Christ</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p>After suffering for many weeks, the nursery leader humbly faced up to her failure and cried out: &ldquo;What more can I do?&rdquo; In that moment she took responsibility for what she had done, and the Lord blessed her with a message that came as an impression in her mind, through the power of the Holy Ghost: Turn to God and ask Him what you should do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She followed the Lord&rsquo;s direction and sought Him in heartfelt prayer. The answer that came was like manna from heaven. It was clear she had to repent, change her attitude and behavior, and focus on loving the children. As she moved forward, she continued to pray with real intent, to search the scriptures, and to seek the Lord&rsquo;s guidance and direction. She sought to be close to the Spirit of the Lord. She feasted on the words of Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the messenger of the covenant.<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>The words of Christ are the words of life and salvation. In His words we can learn who He is, what He did, and what His power can do. In His words we learn of His covenants, His promises, and what He wants us to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The words of Christ are in the scriptures, in the teachings of living prophets, and in our own personal revelation. When we read, study, and ponder the words of Christ, the Holy Ghost carries them into our hearts and tailors them and their meaning to our personal needs.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;They become Christ&rsquo;s words for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I invite you to study the words of Christ and learn about Him. In His mortal ministry Jesus lived and worked and ministered among the people. He was in their midst. He ate in their homes, drank water from their wells, walked in their alleys and passages, taught in the temple, sat on their hillsides, traveled in their ships, and slept where they slept. And He loved them. Everywhere He went, He healed them and inspired them with pure doctrine taught plainly and simply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are just like those people. We, too, can have His words.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;He is with us, in our midst, and He loves us. Through His atoning sacrifice Jesus reaches out with mercy and grace to invite us to have faith in Him, to repent and keep His commandments that He might strengthen and redeem us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is who He is. He gives us His words, and we feast on them by doing what He asks us to do. When we keep our covenants, His words become part of us like a well of water springing up into everlasting life bringing gifts of increased faith, hope, and charity.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;When we follow Christ, His words illuminate our souls<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;and His voice becomes familiar. When questions like &ldquo;What more can I do?&rdquo; burn in our hearts, we will hear His words through the power of the Holy Ghost. As Nephi taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</p>
<p>For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In times of trial and in every other time, feasting on the words of Christ brings blessings of inestimable worth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Look Forward with the Eye of Faith</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p>The nursery leader was blessed with direction from the Lord. With that inspiration she could see and feel in her heart a very different future. She could see the Lord blessing her to lead a nursery with happy children who loved nursery and who felt loved. Although she did not know exactly what to do when she approached the nursery the next Sunday, she looked forward with the eye of faith, and she went forward, trusting that the Lord would bless her and the children to realize the promises she had felt. She walked through the nursery door full of hope, and that hope sustained her as she acted with faith in Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith in Jesus Christ is the assurance of things that we hope for but cannot see.<sup>12&nbsp;</sup>What are the things of Christ for which we hope? They are all that Christ has promised He would do to bring about the Father&rsquo;s plan of salvation for each one of us. We receive these promises in the ordinances and covenants of salvation; they become a reality in our lives as we keep our covenants. Through His atoning sacrifice, Jesus has all power to redeem and save us from death and sin, to strengthen us in our mortal probation, and to help us become more and more like Him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we have faith in Christ, we see these remarkable promises of the redeeming and strengthening power of the Atonement with sharpness and clarity. They come alive in our minds through the power of the Spirit. Our hope for the things of Christ then becomes what the scriptures call lively,<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;bright,<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;and excellent.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;This is the hope that is an anchor to the soul. This is the hope that sustains and supports righteous action in faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The spiritual gifts of faith and hope in Christ are intertwined. Hope in Christ comes of faith in Christ; and lively hope, in turn, sustains and strengthens that faith. We both receive these gifts and develop them through righteous action. As Elder David A. Bednar has taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;... faith in Christ leads to righteous action, which increases our spiritual capacity and power. Understanding that faith is a principle of action and of power inspires us to exercise our moral agency in compliance with gospel truth, invites the redeeming and strengthening <em>powers</em> of the Savior&rsquo;s Atonement into our lives, and enlarges the <em>power</em> within us whereby we are agents unto ourselves (see D&amp;C 58:28).&rdquo;<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In times of trial (and in every other time) these marvelous blessings can be ours when we look forward with the eye of faith<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;and take righteous action. However, looking forward with the eye of faith in times of trial is not easy. The natural man in us looks forward with the eye of fear and sees only darkness, failure, and pain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fear does not come upon us slowly. It springs up in us quickly and can cloud our perspective and our vision. As the Lord taught the Prophet Joseph Smith, the eye of fear leads us to &ldquo;[set] at naught the counsels of God, and [follow] after the dictates of [our] own will and carnal desires. . . .&rdquo;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Fear can lead us to take unrighteous action, and it can paralyze us. It can cause our hearts to fail us so that we shrink from our trials. It can cause us to react to our trials with denial, anger, resentment, and self-pity. This is why the Savior said so many times, &ldquo;Fear not.&rdquo;<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fear does not go away easily. It resists our efforts to overcome it. It reoccurs easily. It is hard work to overcome fear and look forward with the eye of faith. It takes an act of will to say over and over again: "I am not looking forward with the eye of fear. I am looking forward with the eye of faith." It takes prayer with real intent and righteous action to make that act of will a reality and to open to us the redeeming and strengthening power of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When trials come, remember what the Savior said about looking forward with the eye of faith in Him:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.&rdquo;<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Cleave Unto Charity</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p>Before the nursery leader received guidance and direction from the Lord, she dreaded going to nursery. The children were a burden. As she acted with faith in Christ to follow the guidance she received, a miracle took place in her heart and in the children. It was a miracle of charity, the pure love of Christ. She felt Christ&rsquo;s love, and He blessed her to love the children. The children experienced her love in what she did and what she said. They felt Christ&rsquo;s love because Christ&rsquo;s love was in the nursery leader. That miracle of love came because the nursery leader acted with faith and hope in Christ. She came to love by faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his great sermon on faith, hope, and charity, Mormon admonishes us to &ldquo;cleave unto charity.&rdquo;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;In this context &ldquo;cleave&rdquo; means to bind one&rsquo;s self to, or be united with, unwaveringly.<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Mormon&rsquo;s call to &ldquo;cleave unto charity&rdquo; is a call to live our covenants and be true disciples of Jesus Christ. That is why Mormon said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;... charity ... is the greatest of all. ...</p>
<p>Wherefore ... pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ. ...&rdquo; <sup>23</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like faith and hope, charity is a spiritual gift. When we act with faith and hope in Christ to overcome the trials of our lives, we invite the Holy Ghost to bless us with Christ&rsquo;s love and to love as He loves. As Elder Russell M. Nelson has taught, such love is possible but only on conditions of faith and obedience:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus asked us to love one another as He has loved us. Is that possible? Can our love for others really approach divine love? Yes it can! The pure love of Christ is granted to all who seek and qualify for it. Such love includes service and requires obedience.&rdquo; <sup>24</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nursery leader learned that she had to repent before she could obtain heavenly power to love with the pure love of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s redeeming love changed her heart. Through repentance and sustained righteous action, motivated by her love for the Savior and for the children, she became more like Christ and she loved more like He loves. Thus, as Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught, charity is something we become:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason charity never fails and the reason charity is greater than even the most significant acts of goodness &hellip; is that charity, &ldquo;the pure love of Christ&rdquo; (Moro. 7:47), is not an <em>act</em> but a <em>condition</em> or state of being. Charity is attained through a succession of acts that result in a conversion. Charity is something one becomes.&rdquo;<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the nursery leader turned to the Savior for help and began to repent, she turned away from her selfish concerns. She followed the Savior&rsquo;s guidance and began to focus on the children. As she did, she was blessed to see the power of Christ&rsquo;s love. That love was so strong that it could move a two-year-old to choose to cooperate and behave. I do not use this example lightly. I believe it is useful to see in that nursery a little microcosm of the way the Lord helps us overcome the trials we face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of our trials involve relationships with other people. There is often someone to forgive whose heart is hard and has done us harm. There is often someone we need to ask for forgiveness. There is often someone to serve or to love when service and love are hard. There is often someone trying to help us through pain, or illness, or repentance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When trials come, it is natural to pull inward and focus on our own problems, our own pain, and our own needs. That inward focus can invite the very opposite of charity: selfishness, unkindness, impatience, and resentment. Compounded by fear, a focus on ourselves in times of trial can hurt our relationships with the people in our lives. If you had been in that nursery before the nursery leader began to know and love the children, you would have seen an inward focused, very discouraged nursery leader; and you would have seen little children unhappy, lonely, afraid, discouraged, uncooperative, and ornery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the nursery leader began to cleave unto charity, however, you would have seen the power of Christ&rsquo;s pure love.&nbsp; It is the love that forgives, heals, and sanctifies. It is the love that strengthens us against temptation and protects us from evil. It is the love that moves us to help others when trials come to them. Not everyone involved in the trials we face will respond in righteousness, even when we act with love. They have their agency, and they must choose. If we act with faith and hope in Christ, we will strengthen our righteous relationships and find whatever we need to overcome our own trials and help others overcome theirs through the pure love of Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s pure love healed the heart of the nursery leader and protected and strengthened her. Because of these gifts and her righteous action, she grew in charity and in faith and hope and His love healed and blessed those little hearts in the nursery. Christ&rsquo;s love is far more powerful than fear, or anger, or resentment, or anything else; and He will be with us &ldquo;in every time of trouble.&rdquo;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;When we cleave unto charity, the pure love of Christ can bless the people involved in the trials we face; and it can heal, protect, and strengthen us.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I began this talk with two examples of trials facing students at BYU-Idaho. Like the nursery leader, the way forward for these students and for us is faith, hope, and charity:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that the promises of Christ are true. I know this of my own experience through the witness of the Holy Ghost. Sister Clark and I have faced many, many trials in our lives.&nbsp; In all these experiences, I have been an eyewitness of the majesty and power of the Lord Jesus Christ. I have seen His mercy and grace; I have known His power; I have felt His love. I know His promises are true. This is a day of miracles; angels minister among us; and the power of the Holy Ghost is with us because God our Father lives and loves us and Jesus is the Christ, the Holy Son of God, the Savior and Redeemer.</p>
<p>As Jesus said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;<sup>28</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, when times of trial come, rely on these divinely ordained patterns: feast on the words of Christ; look forward with the eye of faith in Christ; and cleave unto charity, the pure love of Christ. Behold the Savior, the wounds in His side, the prints of the nails in His hands and His feet. Behold His glorious resurrection. See Him in your midst. He knows you perfectly. He loves you. See Him forgiving you; cleansing you from sin; lifting you; blessing you with His power and strength; helping you grow in faith, hope, and charity and overcoming and enduring well every trial, no matter what it is, now and forever. This is the Christ. Our faith and hope are in Him. He is mighty to save. His love never fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I so testify from the depths of my heart and soul, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>I am grateful to be with you at the start of this new semester at BYU-Idaho. President Clark and I love you and have great hopes and expectations for you. Today I hope you will feel the Spirit bearing witness to you that Jesus is the Christ. I love Him. He stands at the head of this Church and He leads this university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that the most important relationship we will ever have in our lives is the relationship that we establish with our Heavenly Father and His Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ. The mission of this university is to help you with that relationship. The Lord wants you to become His disciple leaders. As we move forward on that path, it is instructive for us to read the words Jesus left with His disciples of old and take them to heart as we strive to become His disciples today. In John 15, the Lord said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.&rdquo;<sup><sup>1</sup></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As He so often did, the Savior used imagery to teach an important gospel principle. In this case, the Lord compared His relationship with His disciples to a vine and its branches. The branches of a plant can only fulfill their purpose if they bring forth fruit. Similarly, as the disciples of the Savior, we fulfill our purpose only when we &ldquo;bear much fruit.&rdquo; &nbsp;But how do we do that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord provides an answer in the 97th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Here the Savior offers instruction on the establishment of a school in Zion, which is especially applicable to us here at BYU-Idaho. Notice the attitudes and characteristics the Lord says we must have in order to bear fruit as His disciples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice&mdash;yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord shall command&mdash;they are accepted of me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree, which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit.&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, like those early Saints, we have been planted here in a goodly land by a pure stream. We, too, must have hearts that are honest and broken. We must have spirits that are contrite, and we must be willing to observe covenants by every sacrifice the Lord shall command.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this way, we become the Savior&rsquo;s disciples&mdash;healthy branches&mdash;because we have a strong connection to the vine. &nbsp;Without that connection, the Savior said, &ldquo;[we] can do nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But how does that connection happen? It happens through the Holy Ghost. That is why part of the baptismal covenant is to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, whose mission it is to enlighten, guide, instruct, comfort, and testify of Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this university we speak of, listen for, and learn to follow the guidance of the Spirit in all that we do. You will learn to recognize that Spirit working in your lives personally if you will take time at the end of each day to look for the ways he has brought the hand of the Lord into your day. Everything the Spirit does is designed to bring the gifts of the Savior into our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Savior reaches out and lifts us, we must, in order to bear fruit, reach outward and lift others just as He did during His ministry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ammon in the Book of Mormon is a great example. In his experience of lifting others, Ammon&rsquo;s connection to the Savior was healthy, in fact, so healthy that King Lamoni exclaimed when he saw and was astonished by Ammon&rsquo;s great power:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, this is more than a man.&nbsp; Behold, is not this the Great Spirit...?&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ammon&rsquo;s missionary service to the Lamanites yielded much fruit! Of his success he said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.&rdquo;<sup> 6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear to you my testimony that the things I have taught are true. May we all bear much fruit as we labor as disciples of our savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In 1984 the Church published the Book of Mormon with an added title. Do you remember the title that was added? &ldquo;Another Testament of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The Book of Mormon that I had in 1962 was the little paperback copy; it did not have this important subtitle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I learned some years after I joined this Church at the age of 21, that Joseph Smith made an interesting statement in 1842 at the home of Brigham Young, where he was meeting with the Council of the Twelve in Nauvoo, Illinois: &ldquo;I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.&rdquo; You can find this statement today in the Introduction to the Book of Mormon printed near the beginning of the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You older folks who served missions before 1980 did not have an introduction page in the book. It was added in the 1981 edition. In the introduction we read that the Book of Mormon &ldquo;is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible.&rdquo; Another paragraph teaches that &ldquo;the crowning event in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ&hellip;It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.&rdquo; This information was placed in the book years after I had become acquainted with it. If I had known these things, I would have been even more interested in this book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Introduction continues, &ldquo;We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon&hellip;and then to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true&hellip; [to] gain a testimony of its truth&hellip; by the power of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; Those who do so will &ldquo;come to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that Joseph Smith is his revelator and prophet in these last days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo; Preparations are underway now for the &ldquo;second coming of the Messiah.&rdquo; Though I did not have access to this wonderful introduction, my testimony of the restored gospel grew; I became acquainted with these glorious doctrines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A testimony of the gospel is a personal witness born to our souls by the Holy Ghost that certain facts of eternal significance are true and that we know them to be true. My purpose today is to share with you my testimony of the truthfulness of this record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Joseph Smith&rsquo;s First Vision, he learned something that the world needed to know and that certainly he wanted to know. That is that God lives. He also learned that Jesus lives. God pointed to Jesus and said: &ldquo;This is My Beloved Son.&nbsp; Hear Him!&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>. This was in 1820. The power of the Holy Ghost came upon Joseph at this time so that he could endure the presence of the Father and the Son. This was one of the clearest illustrations ever given in the last days of the nature of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Would it surprise you then that in 1 Nephi 1, we would find in verse 5 something that Joseph would be familiar with?&nbsp; Lehi is praying, a pillar of light comes down in front of him, and he saw God. He heard much and also saw that One (Jesus) was sent to the earth, followed by 12 others who did a holy work for all people. Joseph would have been very familiar with the work of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. As Joseph began then to work through the Book of Mormon and the translation, he would come across these principles time and time again. The Book of Mormon really does testify of the power of God and of His Son and of the Holy Ghost working among the people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He would have found, for instance, in 1 Nephi, chapter 11, a very interesting experience related to the Godhead. In verse 6, he would have learned again of the work of the Spirit, God the Father, and the Son of God--a testament of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Joseph would then have worked his way through the book and until he came to 2 Nephi 31. This would have been a marvelous experience for him, just as it was for me, and as it is for you. We find in verse 2 that Nephi and Jacob testify of the doctrine of Christ: &ldquo;Wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying&rdquo; <sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon brings truth forth so plainly. And these truths are so precious. I testify of these truths. This plainness is defined in 2 Nephi 31. You will find in verse 3 that the Lord God will do a work among the children of men. And in the verse following, the Lamb of God will be sent by God to do a sacred work. Verse 7 tells us that the Lamb of God keeps the Father&rsquo;s commandments in doing the work that He will do. In verses 8 and 9 the Holy Ghost will testify that these things are true. And in verse 10 we learn that we should follow Jesus as He has followed the Father in keeping the commandments. What a wonderful thing this would be for us to learn! We would have found back in 1 Nephi 15, verse 14, that there would be a people on the earth in the last days who would come to know the Redeemer. These latter-day people would come to know the very points of doctrine that would help them know how to come unto Him and be saved. That little phrase &ldquo;come unto him&rdquo; or &ldquo;come unto Jesus&rdquo; is used over a dozen times in the Book of Mormon. From the first books to the very last page that invitation continues throughout the book. &ldquo;Come unto Jesus&rdquo; or &ldquo;come unto me that you may be saved&rdquo; is the constant invitation to all who read this sacred record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a fantastic doctrine! Over and over again the Book of Mormon invites us to come unto Christ. Then we find further in 2 Nephi 31:12 the invitation to be baptized with the result that the Father will give us the Holy Ghost. Verse 13 teaches us to &ldquo;follow the Son,&hellip;witnessing unto the Father that [we] are willing to take upon [us] the name of Christ&hellip;and&hellip;receive the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; In verse 14, &lsquo;the voice of the Son&rdquo; acknowledges the Father and the Holy Ghost in connection with the baptisms of water and fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Godhead is revealed over and over in the Book of Mormon. Verse 20 invites us to go forth in Christ with the &ldquo;love of God and of all men&hellip;and endure to the end.&rdquo; Then the Father says, &ldquo;Ye shall have eternal life.&rdquo; What beautiful, plain doctrine for us to learn through this great scripture that has been restored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally in verse 21 of that chapter we learn the only way and the only name whereby we receive the doctrine of Christ and the doctrine of the Father and the doctrine of the Holy Ghost. It is through the name of Christ as pronounced in these great prophetic scriptures in the Book of Mormon. I have learned that I can get closer to God through the Son and the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Is that not plain and precious for us to know in these last days? And we didn&rsquo;t even need 46 publications to teach us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Introduction to the Book of Mormon says that the crowning event in the Book of Mormon is the actual visit of Jesus Christ to a people. From 3 Nephi 9 we learn that the voice of Christ teaches Nephi from the heavens. Later God the Father introduces His Son Jesus Christ to the people.<sup>3</sup> In the New Testament, in the Book of Mormon, and in latter days, this is the pattern. The Father introduces the Son and invites us to hear Him. Between 3 Nephi 9 and 3 Nephi 28:12, there are 531 verses and over 700 personal references to Jesus. Thus, 3 Nephi is one of the great scriptural witnesses in all the world of Jesus Christ Himself and what He did and what He teaches. There are hundreds of witnesses in this book of the things He said and the things He taught.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the use of the pronoun, &ldquo;I&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are over a hundred times in 3 Nephi where Jesus uses &ldquo;I&rdquo;. What a witness of His work and His teachings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let us look at the way He uses &ldquo;He&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just a few of the many dozens of ways this pronoun is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we will review ways Jesus refers to &ldquo;My&rdquo; and &ldquo;Me&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dozens and dozens of times He uses &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;my&rdquo; as He bears His witness in this sacred book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During September and October in our Gospel Doctrine classes we are reading 3 Nephi. Read this book again. Look for the sacred witness that Jesus taught as He came to the people of the Nephite and Lamanite nations. Ponder the key phrases, such as &ldquo;baptized in my name,&rdquo; &ldquo;points of my doctrine,&rdquo; &ldquo;declared my doctrine,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Church in my name,&rdquo; Over 150 times in the space between 3 Nephi 11:1 and 3 Nephi 28:12, Jesus speaks to, prays to, or acknowledges His Father. What greater witness could we have than His own words bearing witness of His own Father:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is not the witness profound in this book, this Book of Mormon, that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that They will do Their work through the prophets in all ages?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are over one hundred references in the Book of Mormon concerning the Godhead. I will point out just three. In 3 Nephi 11 Jesus referred to my doctrine, the Father&rsquo;s doctrine, and the Holy Ghost bearing record of that doctrine. In 3 Nephi 18, Jesus taught that we are to be baptized in His name, witness unto the Father that we have done this, and the Spirit will then be with us.&nbsp; And in 3 Nephi 28, Jesus testified that the Father had given Him the fullness of joy, and the Holy Ghost bore record. Is there any doubt that what Joseph Smith declared about the Godhead in 1820 is true? Joseph said that God appeared and by His side was His Son, Jesus Christ. Joseph was overpowered with a glorious light. The Holy Ghost enabled Joseph to endure the presence of the Father and the Son and be taught by these glorified beings. This is our testament to people today. God lives, Jesus is the Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which has been bestowed upon you, and I will help bear witness of these things to all people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Hinckley has said, &ldquo;I cannot understand why the Christian world does not accept this book. I would think they would be looking for anything that would establish without question the reality and the divinity of the Savior of the world&rdquo;<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us return to 2 Nephi 33, just for a moment, and look at verse 10: &ldquo;And now by beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth&hellip; hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good.&rdquo; Thank you, Nephi. What a great witness from that prophet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now turn to Mormon 7:8: &ldquo;Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and lay hold upon the gospel of Christ, which shall be set before you.&rdquo; The prophet Mormon is speaking about a book that will come forth in our day. He is speaking to us. He wants us to understand the great value of this Book of Mormon record.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, this [the Book of Mormon] is written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Holy Bible]; and if ye believe that ye will believe this also; and if ye believe this ye will know concerning your fathers, and also the marvelous works which have been wrought by the power of God among them&rdquo;<sup>5</sup>. A powerful witness from one who lived in the past but was seeing our day, testifying that these two great records (the Book of Mormon and the Bible) would literally be testaments of Jesus Christ in the last days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many of you have a patriarchal blessing? Mormon 7:10 explains: &ldquo;Ye will also know that ye are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; therefore ye are numbered among the people of the first covenant.&rdquo; You are not just institute students. You are not just students at BYU-Idaho. You are numbered among those of the first covenant, those who will have great blessings and privileges because of this gospel that has been restored. We have faith in Jesus Christ and in God the Father who have given us this plan, including its sacred ordinances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations, what a wonderful people you are! I hope you will learn even more about that in coming weeks as you study the Book of Mormon: &ldquo;And if it so be that ye believe in Christ, and are baptized, first with water, then with fire and with the Holy Ghost, following the example of our Savior, according to that which he hath commanded us, it shall be well with you in the day of judgment. Amen&rdquo;<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like that. I like to know that I am okay before the Lord. I like to know exactly what my circumstance is in this life as I follow Jesus, believe in God, and have the influence of the Holy Ghost in my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful for the following promise from the great prophet Mormon: &ldquo;And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world, whereby he that is found guiltless before him at the judgment day hath it given unto him [or her] to dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost&rsquo;<sup>7</sup>. What a promise to you and me, as ordinary members of the Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith received the plates in 1827. By June of 1829 he had translated the Book of Mormon and had given it to the publisher. The Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood had been restored in 1829 also. Revelation was beginning to come to Joseph as to how to lead the Church and prepare for organizing the Church in 1830. Jesus spoke to Joseph and gave him this instruction, speaking of all scripture: &ldquo;These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of ma; for it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another; and save it were by my power you could not have them; wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words&rdquo;<sup>8</sup>. I bear my testimony to you also that I have heard His voice, and know His words as His servant and as a member of this Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us conclude by returning to the Book of Mormon. This sacred book of scripture introduced us some 600 years before Christ to the thought of &ldquo;coming unto Christ.&rdquo; Four hundred twenty years after He came, the prophet Moroni again invited, &ldquo;Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye&hellip;love God with all your might, mind, and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ&rdquo;<sup>9</sup>.&nbsp; After 1000 years of scriptural record, from 600 years before Christ to 400 years after Christ, we again receive the admonition from the prophet-writer to &ldquo;come unto Christ.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;come unto Christ&rdquo; is repeated over a dozen times in this book, this other testament of Jesus Christ. We find in Moroni 10:33, this amazing promise, &ldquo;If ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then ye are sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father.&rdquo; Remember that we were numbered among those of the first covenant. Moroni concludes with these reassuring words: &ldquo;I&hellip;go to rest in the paradise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite,&rdquo; and he indicates that one day he will be a witness at our judgment that he gave us these things, for which we will have to account.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear testimony of these things. I am one who can claim with Joseph Smith that the Book of Mormon is the keystone of my religion. I am one who can claim that a man can get closer to God by abiding by the precepts of this book than by any other book. I am a witness, as was Joseph, that these things will bring us closer to Christ and closer to God. We see the great work of God restoring this gospel, raising up this Church, bringing back His priesthood; all through His beloved Son Jesus Christ, who lives, who is our Savior, our Redeemer, our Friend, our Helper whose words are readily available to us. His example is before us. Let us do it His way for He knows how to live with God. He invites us to come unto Him and live with God also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bear testimony of these things, as one of those who is a witness, ordained and set apart, to testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ. The Holy Ghost will help us through this life. The Book of Mormon is true. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true Church on the earth today. We have a living prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, who follows in the footsteps of the first prophet of the Restoration, Joseph Smith. This Church holds the keys to salvation in the next life through the authorized servants of God who walk the earth today. Many of you have taught this gospel and testified of your faith in Christ. You have invited people to repent, and you have baptized them with authority in the water. You have bestowed on them the gift of the Holy Ghost that they might walk with that great guide in their lives also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify that these things are in this Church only. I thank you. We love you. We have so much brightness, so much goodness, so much to offer to others. Gain a testimony of these things and see what the Lord can do with you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Alma the Younger, who went from apostate attempting to destroy the Church to high priest committed to saving the Church, was so concerned about his people that he was inspired to select a wise man to replace him as Chief Judge so that he could &ldquo;preach the word of God unto them&hellip; that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people...&rdquo; When he went to Gideon Alma rejoiced that they were &ldquo;still active&rdquo; in the gospel. But he also understood that even the active need encouragement and true doctrine. He ended his testimony to them, after the manner of President Hinckley who was always so positive with us but never let the opportunity to encourage us to do better pass him by, with these words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I would like to share with you a few thoughts on the principle of being &ldquo;easily entreated.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To entreat&rdquo; (according to Mirriam-Webster) is &ldquo;to make an earnest request; to plead with, especially in order to persuade.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think Alma used this phrase to suggest that we should succumb to the enticements of every door-to-door salesperson or television pitch person or crafty manipulator who wants to persuade us to &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; whatever is being &ldquo;sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe &ldquo;easy to be entreated&rdquo; is about how we hear the Lord&rsquo;s word and how we follow the pleadings of the Holy Spirit. Alma&rsquo;s hopes were that the people of Gideon would have minds and hearts open to the messages sent to them by a loving Heavenly Father, anxious to reveal truth, direction, comfort, solace, and assurance to His children. Alma, like Sister Julie B. Beck has taught, wanted the people to qualify for, receive, and act on revelation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alma knew, as well as anyone could have ever known, that through the atonement of Jesus Christ we can be pardoned from punishment for sin and declared guiltless. This pardoning of punishment comes by grace through faith, repentance, and obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, and is called justification. I am grateful beyond comprehension for the blessing of the atonement that makes it possible for me to be &ldquo;justified&rdquo; from my sins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The atonement of Jesus Christ also offers us something even more spiritually and eternally spectacular than justification, as marvelous as that is. The atonement of Jesus Christ also offers us &ldquo;sanctification&rdquo; or becoming free from sin, pure, clean, and holy. In short, through sanctification we can become like our Savior and our Heavenly Father in purity, in character, in charity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A critical stepping-stone on the way to justification and sanctification is being easily entreated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi described the process this way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism&mdash;yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi further explained, &ldquo;Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.&rdquo; These words of Christ, which increase our faith and commitment and teach us all the things that we should be and do, are born into our hearts by the Holy Ghost. They come as a result of prayer, fasting, scripture study, temple attendance, pondering, service, and daily acts of faithful discipleship. They prompt us to faith, repentance, and justification; and then on to the level of service, obedience, consecration, and charity that allows us to retain a remission of our sins while and become sanctified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some experience grand epiphanies like Paul on the road to Damascus. For me the entreaties of the Holy Ghost have most often come in quieter, but in equally profound ways. For several months I have been agonizing over a personal challenge, trying to obtain direction and peace.&nbsp; While preparing for this talk I happened to see President Uchtdorf&rsquo;s October 2008 General Conference talk to the Priesthood brethren entitled &ldquo;Lift Where You Stand.&rdquo; I felt prompted to read it.&nbsp; Buried near the end of the talk was the clarification of a principle that answered my months of searching. And the spirit bore witness to me that it was my answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>King Benjamin summarized the miracle of justification and sanctification in one verse. &ldquo;For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticing of the Holy Spirit [or we could say unless he is easily entreated], and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is through our responses to the Holy Ghost&mdash;our willingness to be entreated by him, whose work it is to speak the words of Christ, that we are able to increase our faith, to have a mighty change wrought in our hearts, to be born of God, and have His image in our countenances. I have also learned that the inspiration of the Holy Ghost gives to those who receive it vision and Christian courage. Without the witness of the Holy Ghost that the teachings of the missionaries are true, despite their age, immaturity, and questionable language skills, a person may not have the courage to choose to leave the comfort of a familiar life style and family religion and risk the potential loss of friends and opportunities and be baptized. Without the witness of the Holy Ghost that the path we are pursuing is correct and in accordance with God&rsquo;s will, we would not have the courage to sacrifice the present gains for a much more important and eternal future. Without the witness of the Holy Ghost we would not be able to discern truth in the cacophony of noise hurled at us by the world partying away in the great and spacious building. Without the witness of the Holy Ghost about what is true, and what is important, we would not be able to hold the course, or return to the course, through storms of trial and difficulty, with faith, optimism and confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Cecil Samuelson described the opportunity he and Sister Samuelson had during the Olympics in Salt Lake City to host at a performance in the Conference Center, Mr. Mike Wallace, the television journalist who interviewed President Hinckley twice on his program. He said, &ldquo;While Mr. Wallace could never trip up or confuse President Hinckley with his penetrating questions, they become good friends as a result of these interviews. Mr. Wallace frequently made very complimentary comments about President Hinckley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the performance, we met President and Sister James E. Faust of the First Presidency. As I introduced President Faust to Mike Wallace and explained the close relationship President Faust and President Hinckley enjoyed in the First Presidency, Mr. Wallace said to President Faust, &ldquo;You are just the man to answer a question I have had for some time. Gordon Hinckley is the most optimistic man I have ever met. Can you tell me why?&rdquo;&nbsp; President Faust didn&rsquo;t hesitate for even a moment and replied with a twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;President Hinckley knows how all this is going to turn out.&rdquo; The Holy Ghost does bless his servants &ndash; which includes all of us &ndash; with the assurance of &ldquo;how it is all going to turn out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sarah Rich, early Nauvoo pioneer, is quoted in <em>Daughters in My Kingdom </em>saying,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For if it had not been for the faith and knowledge that was bestowed upon us in that temple by the influence and help of the Spirit of the Lord, our journey would have been like one taking a leap in the dark. To start out&hellip;in the winter as it were and in our state of poverty, it would seem like walking into the jaws of death. But we had faith in our Heavenly Father, and we put our trust in Him feeling that we were His chosen people and had embraced his gospel, and instead of sorrow, we felt to rejoice that the day of our deliverance had come.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we are easily entreated by the Holy Ghost, along with wisdom, direction, confirmation, solace, comfort, aid, and increased faith, we are given optimism and hope. We rejoice as we sing the song of redeeming love because the Holy Ghost confirms in our hearts a love of the Savior, a knowledge of His plan, and a fervent desire to make and keep covenants that will ultimately bless our lives as we are consecrated to the Savior&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we improve our willingness to listen, to hear, and to be entreated by the Holy Ghost? Because faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ, is the fundamental principle of the gospel, developing the ability to listen to His words, His entreaties to us through the Holy Ghost, is much the same as developing and improving faith. Alma describes seven facets of this process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we must humble ourselves through repentance so that we can be receptive to his counsel. Second, we must awake and arouse our faculties to experiment upon the word of counsel given. Third, we need to exercise a particle of faith to act on the counsel. Fourth, we need to continue to nurture what we have been told despite a tendency to doubt or be discouraged. Fifth, we will recognize the confirmation that what we have heard is good and right and true. Sixth, we nourish what we have heard with care, and continue to act on it. And seventh, we come to know and appreciate the counsel as sweet, and feast upon it.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we are developing our abilities to hear counsel &ndash; to desire it, and want it &ndash; even when it might go contrary to what we think we want &ndash; we must also be careful to avoid the things that will make it impossible to hear the still small voice. I come from a long line of people who lose their hearing as they age. My family jokes about the wonderful time we have together yelling loudly at each other in order to communicate. The truth is, that unless we are learning to hear, to listen, and to be persuaded, the Spirit will eventually stop making the attempt to communicate with us.<br /></p>
<p>Alma gave us some helpful warnings about the things that interfere with being easily entreated. These include being lifted up in the pride of our hearts, setting our hearts upon riches and the vain things of the world, and worshiping idols. When we think about them clearly, we see that the first is the parent to the other two. Pride pulls us away from the two great commandments, to love God and our fellowmen, and to, in fact, worship ourselves like golden calves by catering to our own desires and whims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pride creates a hardened crust that doesn&rsquo;t allow the influence of the Holy Ghost to penetrate our hearts or minds. How many of the good potato farmers in Madison County would want to plant after a caravan of heavy equipment had driven across the land, back and forth, over and over again, packing the soil so tightly that it was as hard as asphalt? That&rsquo;s what pride does to the soil of our hearts and minds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Benson&rsquo;s masterful sermon on pride taught us, &ldquo;the central feature of pride is enmity &ndash; enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen. It is the power by which Satan wishes to reign over us. Pride is essentially competitive in nature...the proud cannot accept the authority of God giving direction to their lives&hellip;The proud wish God would agree with them.&nbsp; They aren&rsquo;t interested in changing their opinions to agree with God&rsquo;s&hellip; Another major portion of this very prevalent sin of pride is enmity toward our fellowmen. We are tempted daily to elevate ourselves above others and diminish them. The proud make every man their adversary by pitting their intellects, opinions, works, wealth, talents, or any other worldly measuring device against others.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Benson concluded his powerful message with these words, &ldquo;The antidote for pride is humility&mdash;meekness, submissiveness, and he referenced Alma 7:23 where humility and submissiveness are listed just before &ldquo;easy to be entreated&rdquo;. God will have a humble people.&rdquo; Then President Benson suggested that we can yield to the enticing of the Holy Spirit, put off the natural man and choose to be humble by doing the following: Esteeming our brothers and sisters as ourselves and lifting them as high or higher than we are; receiving counsel and chastisement; forgiving those who have offended us; rendering selfless service; going on missions and preaching the word; getting to the temple more frequently; confessing and forsaking our sins; loving God and submitting our will to His and putting Him first in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes it may not be easy to take counsel or chastisement, to admit we have made an error and need to repent. One of the reasons I have a testimony that Joseph Smith was, indeed, a true prophet and a man of God, is that he was willing to have recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants his chastisements from God. I don&rsquo;t think a fraud would have been willing to be so exposed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If ever there was a young man who wanted the safety and security of good friends to stand by him, that young man was Joseph Smith. He eventually found such a friend in Martin Harris.&nbsp; Harris was all that Joseph Smith was not. He was more mature, better educated, more prosperous, and well respected in Palmyra. To have such a man as a friend and benefactor was truly as blessing to the young prophet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Martin Harris requested permission to take the first 116 pages of the translation of the plates home so that his wife could see them and stop nagging him about his support of Joseph Smith, Joseph took the request to the Lord. The answer was no. Finally the third time, the Lord said, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and Martin departed from Harmony, Pennsylvania with the 116 pages to show his wife in Palmyra, New York. Martin was given strict instructions about the precious document. It was the &ldquo;only one&rdquo; in existence. No scribe had made a copy. It wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;backed up&rdquo; in any way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tragic family circumstances kept Joseph Smith from thinking about Martin Harris and the manuscript for a time. But, he eventually became worried, so worried that he traveled to Palmyra to retrieve the 116 pages. When finally confronted with the fact that Martin Harris no longer had the manuscript, Joseph felt that he had lost his soul. He knew the parameters the Lord had set. He also knew that he had wearied the Lord with repeated requests. He lost his gift of translation. He was devastated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Joseph was willing to be entreated after this terrible error, an error anticipated by the great prophet Mormon who was persuaded by the Spirit to include the small plates of Nephi with his own abridgement &ldquo;for a wise purpose&rdquo; unknown to him. The Lord chastised Joseph in section 3 of the Doctrine and Covenants with these words, &ldquo;Remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated, but the work of men&hellip;. For, behold, you should not have feared man more than God&hellip;you should have been faithful; and I [God] would have extended his arm and supported you against all the fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have been with you in every time of trouble&hellip; remember, God is merciful; therefore repent of that which thou has done which is contrary to the commandment which I gave you, and thou art still chosen, and art again called to do the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph heard the counsel, was submissive and easy to be entreated, and became the great prophet of the restoration who did &ldquo;more save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being easily entreated isn&rsquo;t a one-time happening that lasts for life. Like all other gospel principles and attributes, it must be continued in order &ldquo;to count.&rdquo; Some may think that one period of intense service is all that is required of a consecrated Latter-day Saint. They may believe that if they serve a mission, their contribution to the kingdom has been made and there is no further need to serve or be directed. The life of any one of our General Authorities or General Auxiliary Presidencies would demonstrate the fallacy in that thinking. Some may be dedicated to being easily entreated in order to find someone to marry and start a family. But that is just the beginning of a constant need for guidance. Some may think that one only needs to be easily entreated if one has an &ldquo;important&rdquo; calling like Bishop or Relief Society President. I have learned for myself how false that idea is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one time in my life I had the best calling in the Church &ndash; that of Primary pianist. I could play all the songs, sometimes with a little added flourish, I didn&rsquo;t need to practice, and the chorister didn&rsquo;t need to give me the songs early. Given how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; it was for me, I never, not even once, asked the Lord how He wanted me to fulfill my calling as Primary pianist. I knew all I needed to know &ndash; or so I thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then one evening I went to an in-service meeting. We were all challenged to sincerely pray about our callings. I thought to myself, &ldquo;What is there to pray about? I can do already do this &ndash; and I do it pretty well.&rdquo; But, after a little cultivation of the soil of my soul, I decided to be obedient. The message that came into my mind was, &ldquo;Play the songs the children are working on for the program, the songs they know, for prelude music.&rdquo; Up until this time I had just picked my way through the children&rsquo;s song book playing anything that looked fun to me. When I began to follow the entreaty of the Spirit something happened in Primary. It took several weeks to notice it but as the children hummed along to the tunes they knew and reverence in our Primary increased. None of us are ever &ldquo;so good&rdquo; at what we might be asked to do that we couldn&rsquo;t do it better if we were easily entreated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we may also think that if we have been listening for awhile we have received all the messages God could possibly send us; that we don&rsquo;t need any more direction from God. We think that whatever we got during our college years is all we will ever need; or that whatever the Lord told us three callings ago is good for the calling we currently have; or the inspiration we had for the people we home or visit taught five years ago is good for the ones we visit today. I testify from personal experience that there will never, ever, ever be a time when we will not need current, up-to-the-minute revelation in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you feel challenged. If you have been disappointed. If you are struggling with any burden large or small. If you are not happy in your relationships. If you are unsure about the future. If you have deep and troubling questions. If you worry that because divorce is frequent marriage should be avoided. If you are concerned about whether you have a role to play in the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom, I promise you that the answers will come as you put yourself in the position of being easily entreated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Helaman 6:36 we read that &ldquo;the Lord began to pour out his Spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his words.&rdquo; Elder Michael T. Ringwood said, &ldquo;I [have come] to realize this easiness and willingness to believe in the word of God comes from a softness of heart. It comes from having a heart that is sensitive to the Holy Ghost. It comes from having a heart that can love. It comes from having a heart that will make and keep sacred covenants. It comes from a soft heart that can feel the power of the Atonement of Christ&hellip;.An easiness and willingness to believe the word of God will come from repentance and obedience.&rdquo;<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being easily entreated also allows us to understand things as they really are and as they really will be. Last year the marvelous book, <em>Daughters in My Kingdom</em>, was sent to all the sisters in the Church. It teaches the women in the Church &ndash; and the men if they will read it &ndash; how our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, feel about them. It has come, under the direction of the First Presidency, through an official calling by the Prophet to Sister Susan W. Tanner, and under the guidance of the General Relief Society Presidency. It is a testament to the important role women play, alongside faithful priesthood holders, in the work of Salvation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have felt the Spirit bear witness to me of its timeless truths. One of those truths is the relationship between men and women in the kingdom. Because of <em>Daughters in My Kingdom </em>I have a better understanding of who my sisters are. But, I also have a better understanding of my brothers as well. I have had the spiritual assurance that God loves his daughters and his sons equally. I have come to know that they each have a great work to do in the kingdom. And I have come to understand that if Satan can make us think less of each other, to have disrespectful thoughts about each other, to believe that the relationships between women and men are defined by portrayals on soap operas and sit-coms or the lyrics of some popular music, he will have won a major portion of the battle for the souls of men and women. And I promise you that if you will be easily entreated by the Holy Ghost, he will teach you the truth about the way we should treat each other, mutual disciples of Jesus Christ, with respect, honor, and kindness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some time after the death of Joseph Smith, he appeared to President Brigham Young and shared this important counsel: &ldquo;Tell the people to be humble and faithful and [be] sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach you what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom. Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them, their hearts will be ready to receive it. They can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits. It will whisper peace and joy to their souls, and it will take malice, hatred, envying, strife, and all evil from their hearts; and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness, and build up the kingdom of God. Tell the brethren if they will follow the Spirit of the Lord they will go right.&rdquo;<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I testify of the power of the atonement. I testify of God&rsquo;s love for us and his supernal gift of the Holy Ghost to us. I pray that we might develop the capacity to be easily entreated, that the Holy Ghost will be our constant guide and companion, that we might be more faithful disciples of Jesus Christ. In his Holy name, Amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is a great privilege to gather with you to worship our Father in the name of His Son. I extend a special greeting to Pathway and other students who are participating at a distance. Even though you are not physically present, we feel of your spirit and devotion. Members of this campus community pray for the success of all the students, both those in Rexburg and &ldquo;all over the earth.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate the personal preparations you have made for this devotional assembly. It is my prayer that the Lord will reward your exercise of faith with an increase of the Spirit. Because the most important messages of this devotional will not be given from the pulpit, I invite the ministry of the Holy Ghost to be our teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subject of this address is one that is sacred, yet sometimes misunderstood and misapplied. I speak of grace. With the light of the restored gospel, we have a different understanding of this term than many of our friends in other Christian faiths.<a href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;The Bible Dictionary gives an excellent definition of grace:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main idea of the word is divine means of help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It is through the grace of the Lord Jesus, made possible by his atoning sacrifice, that mankind will be raised in immortality, every person receiving his body from the grave in a condition of everlasting life. It is likewise through the grace of the Lord that individuals, through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of their sins, receive strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means.<a href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is by grace that we will be resurrected. It is also by grace that we obtain forgiveness when we sincerely repent. The aspect of grace upon which I will focus is the Savior&rsquo;s enabling power. In a devotional talk given at BYU, Elder Bednar explained:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my personal scripture study I often insert the term <em>enabling power</em> whenever I encounter the word <em>grace.</em> &hellip;I believe we can learn much about this vital aspect of the Atonement if we will insert <em>enabling and strengthening power</em> each time we find the word <em>grace</em> in the scriptures.<a href="#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can gain strength and ability, according to the Lord&rsquo;s will. This endowment of grace enables and empowers us to gain knowledge, do good works, and become something that is beyond our own capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a law, irrevocably decreed<a href="#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>, which must be obeyed to assure that we will receive His grace.<a href="#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;What is this law? To investigate this question, we will consider some scriptural examples where grace was given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>The Widow of Zarephath</em></strong></p>
<p>Elijah the prophet was sent to the widow of Zarephath during a great famine. He found her nearly out of food, preparing one last meal before she and her son died of starvation. Elijah asked her to make a little cake for him first. He promised her that: &ldquo;The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;Exercising her faith by sacrifice, she obeyed. In return, she was given grace. Miraculously, she never ran out of meal or oil. This reminds me of the Lord&rsquo;s gift of manna. This widow had sufficient for each new day.<a href="#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;This miracle occurs in our time. For example, how many of us have witnessed the miraculous stretching of meager finances?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>The Brother of Jared</em></strong></p>
<p>In another example, the brother of Jared repeatedly constructed barges to carry his family, animals, and provisions towards the promised land. The Lord asked him to devise a way to light the barges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exercising his agency and guided by inspiration, the brother of Jared melted sixteen stones from a high mountain, which he hoped could shine in darkness. The Brother of Jared did everything he could to obey the Lord, but it was not enough. The stones did not yet shine. Acting in faith, the Brother of Jared asked the Lord to touch the stones and give them light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was permitted to see the finger of the Lord as his prayer was answered. Exercising more faith, the Brother of Jared was able to see the Lord&rsquo;s whole personage. By grace, the brother of Jared was brought back into the Lord&rsquo;s presence.<a href="#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Brother of Jared was given difficult commandments, and only told how to complete part of them. He studied the problem out in his own mind and proposed a solution.<a href="#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;The best efforts of the Brother of Jared were not enough. After giving the commandment, the Lord tenderly helped the Brother of Jared keep it. Notice how much the Lord does for his people!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Oliver Granger</em></strong></p>
<p>In the Doctrine and Covenants, we read about Oliver Granger&mdash;a rather ordinary and mostly blind latter-day saint.<a href="#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;After the saints were driven from Kirtland, the Lord assigned this faithful brother the arduous task of selling properties belonging to the Church and its leaders. Imagine his difficulty! How do you sell real estate in a market saturated with abandoned homes, farms, and businesses?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a tender statement about Oliver Granger, the Lord said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, let him contend earnestly for the redemption of the First Presidency of my Church, saith the Lord; and when he falls he shall rise again, for <em>his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase</em>, saith the Lord.<a href="#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord knew he would face great difficulty&mdash;and some failures. Exerting his best efforts to obey, Brother Granger emulated the Savior who obeyed His Father&rsquo;s every word and will. In tenderness, the Lord accepted Oliver Granger&rsquo;s private sacrifice notwithstanding the modest outward results of his labors.<a href="#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;Was the Lord&rsquo;s grace involved? Brother Granger was again entrusted with this assignment after the saints were driven from Independence, Far West, and, finally, Nauvoo.<a href="#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hold Oliver Granger&rsquo;s name in sacred remembrance. It is a reminder that &ldquo;[our] sacrifice shall be more sacred unto [the Lord] than [our] increase.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Moses</em></strong></p>
<p>In the book of Moses, we learn of a vision he had of the Savior.<a href="#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;The Lord showed Moses some of his works and glory and then departed. With his physical body exhausted, Moses discovered that man&rsquo;s power is nothing in comparison to God&rsquo;s.<a href="#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;After Moses regained his natural strength, Satan came to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Moses refused to follow him, the adversary intensified his attack. &ldquo;Moses began to fear exceedingly&hellip;&rdquo; Notice what happens next. &ldquo;&hellip;[A]s he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell. Nevertheless, calling upon God, he received strength.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn18" target="_self"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;In contrast to the effects of fear, when Moses relied upon the word of God and prayer, he received strength, or grace, and was able to withstand the trial. This is a profound pattern for us. Christ has commanded us to &ldquo;doubt not, fear not,&rdquo;<a href="#_edn19" target="_self"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;and &ldquo;quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn20" target="_self"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp;By so doing, we invite the Lord&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Experience</em></strong></p>
<p>I would like to share a personal experience of the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Please note that I am not the hero in the story; every good thing that came to pass was a gift of the Savior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After teaching here for two years, I received a distinct prompting&mdash;a personal commandment&mdash;to get a Ph.D. in Statistics. My wife encouraged me to obey, and the university granted a temporary leave of absence. About two years after the prompting, I began a Ph.D. program in Statistics at Purdue University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was terrifying to be in graduate school on a strict timeline. The burden was overwhelming. I could recite the famous words of Nephi, &ldquo;that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn21" target="_self"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp;I knew this was true for other people, but I did not liken it unto myself.<a href="#_edn22" target="_self"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp;President Henry B. Eyring taught, &ldquo;Faith is not simply to know God <em>could</em> do something. Faith is to know He <em>will</em>.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn23" target="_self"><sup>23</sup></a>&nbsp;I realized I needed more faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognizing that my fear was not from God, I sought His help in prayer. In this process, strength was granted. My faith grew, leading to a deepened realization that the Lord knew <em>all</em> things. He already possessed all the statistical, research and writing skills I needed to develop. He knew the questions and answers for exams yet to be written. He knew every detail of my future research. <em>All</em> things are before him continually.<a href="#_edn24" target="_self"><sup>24</sup></a>&nbsp;It was my responsibility and privilege to learn that our Savior is a personal teacher and tutor, who ministers one by one.<a href="#_edn25" target="_self"><sup>25</sup></a>&nbsp;After much prayer and fasting that first semester, I received the calm assurance that the Lord <em>would</em> help me complete the degree in the allotted time. Doubt was completely replaced by faith.<a href="#_edn26" target="_self"><sup>26</sup></a>&nbsp;The program was still difficult, but I approached it with peace and confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cherished the Sabbath day and enjoyed serving in our callings. Great care was required to balance family, church, and school responsibilities. After giving my best in earnest study and prayer, the Holy Ghost inspired solutions to homework and exam problems.<a href="#_edn27" target="_self"><sup>27</sup></a>&nbsp;A suitable research topic eventually became apparent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process was still difficult, but I knew it would all work out&mdash;I just did not know how. The burden was not removed, but it was made light.<a href="#_edn28" target="_self"><sup>28</sup></a>&nbsp;Our family memorized and recited a scripture that brought us comfort: &ldquo;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn29" target="_self"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior, by His grace, magnified our offering. The assurance previously seen only with an eye of faith<a href="#_edn30" target="_self"><sup>30</sup></a>&nbsp;yielded evidence as I completed the degree in the time allowed.<a href="#_edn31" target="_self"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking to the prophet Moroni, the Lord said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[M]y grace is sufficient for the meek.... And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.<a href="#_edn32" target="_self"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, we can accomplish anything He asks us to do. Remember, the Lord enabled David to kill Goliath with just one stone. I solemnly witness that He helps all His people, just as he has helped me with my academic Goliath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Enduring to the End</em></strong></p>
<p>A caution is warranted here. The story of David reminds us that no matter how great the challenges are that we have overcome, we must continue to exercise faith in the Lord and endure to the end.<a href="#_edn33" target="_self"><sup>33</sup></a>&nbsp;We must not allow ourselves to be lured away by any distractions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, we might get discouraged when our efforts seem to outweigh our blessings. We might be tempted to think that we are ignored by our God or, even worse, that God does not exist. It may seem, for a while, that those who break the commandments are better off than those who keep them. Heavenly Father told Malachi that this would happen: &ldquo;And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn34" target="_self"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may fail to reach a personal goal despite living righteously, expending our best efforts, and extending help to others. The challenges we face foster growth, leading us to a &ldquo;more excellent way.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn35" target="_self"><sup>35</sup></a>&nbsp;I hope we will never murmur when the Lord provides a course correction.</p>
<p>For example, an obedient, hard-working pre-med student may still not qualify for admission to a top-ten medical school. Although it can be painful, the Lord might be directing this student to a path that will be better for them and their family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can avoid the pitfall of doubt by humbly asking what we are to learn from a challenge, seeking guidance, and pressing forward with faith. It is not possible for us to &ldquo;comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn36" target="_self"><sup>36</sup></a>&nbsp;Representing Christ, Isaiah wrote, &ldquo;For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn37" target="_self"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Jesus Christ</em></strong></p>
<p>Our resources, including time, talents, willpower, love, and patience are insufficient to satisfy the demands placed on them. Alma the Younger teaches us that Christ, who has experienced all things, understands:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.<a href="#_edn38" target="_self"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christ comprehends all things.<a href="#_edn39" target="_self"><sup>39</sup></a>&nbsp;There is no pain or joy we can feel that the Savior has not <em>personally</em> experienced. He knows how to succor us individually. The Latin root of the word &ldquo;succor&rdquo; means &ldquo;to go beneath, or to run to help.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn40" target="_self"><sup>40</sup></a>&nbsp;How grateful I am for the One who has not only gone beneath all things to be able to run to our aid, but who has ascended above all things that He might lead us to a fullness of joy!<a href="#_edn41" target="_self"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Grace for Grace</em></strong></p>
<p>As the Savior&rsquo;s cousin and childhood companion, John the Baptist was among those who knew the Savior best. Please note what John wrote about the Savior and grace:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I, John, bear record that I beheld his glory, as the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, even the Spirit of truth, which came and dwelt in the flesh, and dwelt among us.</p>
<p>And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace <em>for</em> grace;</p>
<p>And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace <em>to</em> grace, until he received a fulness;</p>
<p>And thus he was called the Son of God, because he received not of the fulness at the first.</p>
<p>&hellip;And I, John, bear record that he received a fulness of the glory of the Father;</p>
<p>And he received all power, both in heaven and on earth, and the glory of the Father was with him, for he dwelt in him.<a href="#_edn42" target="_self"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After quoting these verses, the Savior explained to Joseph Smith:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know <em>how</em> to worship, and know <em>what</em> you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.</p>
<p>For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace<em> for </em>grace. <a href="#_edn43" target="_self"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do we worship? We worship God the Eternal Father. How do we worship? We worship by emulating His son through sacrifice.<a href="#_edn44" target="_self"><sup>44</sup></a>&nbsp;If we do this diligently, we will receive of the Father&rsquo;s fullness.<a href="#_edn45" target="_self"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul taught that gifts of the Spirit are given through grace.<a href="#_edn46" target="_self"><sup>46</sup></a>&nbsp;When we receive spiritual gifts, we must &ldquo;minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn47" target="_self"><sup>47</sup></a>&nbsp;We are given gifts of the Spirit for the purpose of sharing them with others.<a href="#_edn48" target="_self"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;We extend grace to others as we share the gifts we have received. Then, &ldquo;[God] doth immediately bless [us]&hellip;&rdquo;<a href="#_edn49" target="_self"><sup>49</sup></a>&nbsp;with more grace. This is one way we emulate the Savior and receive grace <em>for</em> giving grace.<a href="#_edn50" target="_self"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The commentary <em>Revelations of the Restoration</em> states:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grace is divine help, or in other words, enabling power and strength that comes from God. The Savior increased in grace as he lived the commandments of God and blessed the lives of others. His growth was accelerated above that of his fellowmen because of the reciprocal nature of receiving strength of the Spirit when extending grace. That is, he called upon his Father for power and strength to bless others in their need. In answer to his prayers, he was empowered and grew beyond his previous abilities, thus, receiving grace for grace. Christ was foremost in reaching out in compassion to others. Therefore, he received greater grace from God in his efforts than any other person. He increased his capacity to give with each experience, continuing &lsquo;from grace to grace.&rsquo; <a href="#_edn51" target="_self"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must follow this pattern, as we come unto Christ. Receiving is not a passive activity.<a href="#_edn52" target="_self"><sup>52</sup></a>&nbsp;As an example, we receive grace as we listen to, study, and apply General Conference talks. I invite you to ponder ways in which you can give grace that you might receive grace. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>
<p>Returning to my initial question: what is the law upon which the spiritual gift of grace is predicated?<a href="#_edn55" target="_self"><sup>55</sup></a>&nbsp;There is no step-by-step recipe for obtaining grace. However, patterns are woven into every scriptural example of this principle. We must exercise faith, repent, extend grace to others, and endure to the end. In short, we must worship the Father and emulate His Son. Giving and receiving grace requires our full efforts, &ldquo;&hellip;for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, <em>after all we can do</em>.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn56" target="_self"><sup>56</sup></a>&nbsp;This enabling and strengthening power is a vital part of our quest to become like the Lord. It is a profound gift from a loving Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I testify that our Savior lives. His grace is sufficient for the meek who humble themselves and extend grace to others. I witness that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. This sacred, additional witness of Jesus Christ teaches us how to give and receive grace. The Lord is willing to grant grace to us. I invite you to find ways to give grace in greater measure, that the Lord may give more grace to you. I promise you that He will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren [and sisters], let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.<a href="#_edn57" target="_self"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we be blessed as we do this, in the sacred name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thank President and Sister Clark and all of you for hosting me here today. You are a truly magnificent sight. This is my first visit ever to the BYU&ndash;Idaho campus. This is as far north as I&rsquo;ve ever been in Idaho and my husband and I have just been so impressed with the beauty of the campus, the kindness of the students we have met, and a sense of your community and identities, so I thank you for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to thank my former home teacher from my ward in Provo for coming today. But you&rsquo;ll be relieved to know he didn&rsquo;t drive all the way just for my devotional address. He&rsquo;s actually a freshman here at BYU&ndash;Idaho. And my daughters emphatically said, &ldquo;You cannot say Dylan Forsythe&rsquo;s name, because you&rsquo;ll embarrass him.&rdquo; So, I assured them I would refer to him only as my home teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been really delighted in our short visit to get to spend time with my former college roommate, going back far more years than I would publicly care to admit, and one of my very best friends from college who works here at BYU-Idaho. She and I met in an honors course and a Book of Mormon course at BYU when we were freshmen. She tried very hard to avoid allowing me to become her friend, but I pursued her relentlessly as we walked back to the dorms after our Book of Mormon class and she finally had to give in and she&rsquo;s never regretted it, nor have I. It&rsquo;s been one of the most treasured relationships of my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I would like to speak to you about the vital importance of being part of a community. I think you are doing some very interesting and important things here at the BYU-Idaho community and learning and loving within this community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I had been teaching at BYU in Provo for about a year, I was asked to instruct a fall semester of the freshmen academy course in classics and the classical tradition. Freshman Academy, which at BYU has more recently given way to a program known as Freshman Mentoring, was originally established in an effort to help incoming freshmen make the transition to a university education; to help them feel more fully integrated into the life of the university; and to make them more likely to continue that life and that education. The students who participated in the program were organized into so-called learning communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From that fall, back in 1997 to this one, I have taught that general education course almost every year. And every year, I find myself thinking anew about the importance of belonging to a learning community; particularly about the influence of a community on how and what we learn, and on who and what we become. Those are questions that have been considered by thinkers since very ancient times. In his <em>Politics</em>, Aristotle describes the creation of the ancient Greek city-state, which Greek&rsquo;s call the <em>polis</em> in the following way:</p>
<p>The ultimate human partnership, composed of a number of villages and having already reached, one could say, the highest level of self-sufficiency, is the polis or city-state. It has come into being basically so that life could continue, but it continues so that life can be a good life. Consequently, each polis is a natural thing being the result of the processes that have led up to its formation.</p>
<p>Aristotle was a big believer in things evolving in natural ways to some particular purpose or end. He says, after all the reason anything exists is purpose, or end, is the chief good. He asserts that autarky or self-sufficiency can also mean self-rule, is the best end of all. From all of this, he says, it is evident that the <em>polis</em> has come to be from natural processes. Then this very important phrase:</p>
<p>And that a man is a <em>politokos zo&ouml;n</em>, that is, a creature suited to live in a polis. Anyone who does not belong to a <em>polis</em> either by chance or by his own nature is either sub-human or super-human. He is like the man criticized by Homer, &lsquo;without clan, law, or hearth.&rsquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The <em>polis</em> was the basic political unit of the ancient Greek world. It was in place by approximately 750 BC &mdash;the beginning of the Archaic Period. Surprisingly little can be said about <em>polis,</em> beginning its development as it did, in what were the Greek Dark Ages, from which we have no surviving literature. By the time we do have literature about the <em>polis</em>, it is already an accomplished fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is generally assumed that families and then larger social networks grouped together for protection during the insecurity and disruption of the Dark Ages; and that these groupings became increasingly permanent settlements around defended or at least potentially defensible locations like the Acropolis in Athens. There&rsquo;s several points of Aristotle&rsquo;s statement that I would like to discuss. First, the <em>polis,</em> he says came into being so life could continue. Second, the polis continues so that life can be a good life. And third, man, he says, is a <em>politikos zo&ouml;n</em>. We&rsquo;ll come back to that phrase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first statement: the <em>polis </em>came into being so life could continue suggests that human beings need community to survive physically or at least that being in a community makes our chances of survival much better. The second statement suggests that the quality of life is improved by being in a community. It continues so that life can be a good life. In other words, once men have established some sort of physical safety and security, individual members of community can begin to specialize, to divide labor and to produce those goods and services that refine and beautify life; to consider the world around us; to think about philosophical issues; and about our own moral identity and purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final statement that man is a <em>politikos zoon </em>has frequently and I would say wrongly, but translated man is a political animal. The phrase does not seem to refer to our intense interest, even in an election year, in what we would call politics, but instead seems to be saying that human beings are suited to life in a <em>polis</em>. In other words, that human beings need community to have the best quality of life and to be at their very best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a unique sensitivity to the need for community in the Christian traditions as evidenced in latter- day scripture. From before Enoch to the early Christian era, to Joseph Smith and the Restoration, saints have tried to be of one heart and one and of one soul to establish communities that deserve the name Zion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see this in our lives all the time in the LDS community in the framework of our current religion: how we are organized into families, into wards, into stakes, and you will be familiar with the habit of calling fellow members of the Church &ldquo;brother&rdquo; and &ldquo;sister&rdquo;. There are also I think unique challenges posed by being members of a religious community where we are often partnered as missionary companions, as home teaching companions, as members of auxiliary presidency, and undoubtedly in your experience now, as roommates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we are paired with people we may not have a great deal in common with and we may not have thought to choose as our associates if we had had any say in the matter. This can be as I say a very challenging thing to be required by circumstance, or by a calling or by an assignment made by a mission president or by a roommate assignment to interact closely and intimately with people that we might not have hand selected as our friends. This I think is true no matter the size of the religious community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a very interesting book written, it was originally published in 1948, by an author named Thomas Merton, called <em>Seven Story Mountain</em>. It is Thomas Merton&rsquo;s autobiography and in it this very fascinating writer talks about his conversion from atheism or at least agnosticism, his conversion to Catholicism and eventually his determination to enter into a monastic community to begin living his life, or the remainder of his life, as a monk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one of the sections of this biography, he describes and discusses his decision to enter the monastic community and specifically his experience once he had entered the monastic community: of being inside the community rather than looking at and admiring and developing certain ideas of the monastic community from the outside looking in. This is what he had to say, once he had entered the monastic community:</p>
<p>Now I was face to face with monks that belonged not to some dream, not to some medieval novel, but to cold and inescapable reality. The community which I had seen functioning as a unity in all the power of that impressive and formal meturgical anonymity which clothes a body of men obscurely in the very personality of Christ Himself now appeared to me broken up into its constituent parts. And all the details good and bad, pleasant and unpleasant, were there for me to observe at close range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By this time,God had given me enough sense to realize at least obscurely that this is one of the most important aspects of any religious vocation. The first and most elementary test of one&rsquo;s called to the religious life, [and then he says this very important phrase] is the willingness to accept life in a community in which everybody is more or less imperfect.</p>
<p>So what he had admired from the outside as this sort of unified Christian ideal, inside were real people like himself, pleasant and unpleasant, good and bad.</p>
<p>And this is one of the most basic challenges of the religious life. Accepting the necessities must be part of the community in which we are all imperfect. [I submit to you this is something like your experience at this university and in your wards.] The imperfections are much smaller and more trivial than the defects and vices of people outside in the world. And yet somehow you tend to notice them more because they get to be so greatly magnified by the responsibilities and ideals of the religious state through which you cannot help looking at them.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>So I think sometimes we are inclined to be more compassionate, more forgiving, more understanding, of people outside our religious community than we are of those inside for whom we have very clearly defined articulated expectations of how they ought to be living. And we judge each other perhaps more harshly with those very high expectations or to use Merton&rsquo;s phrase, because they get to be &ldquo;magnified by the responsibilities and ideals of the religious state.&rdquo; The ideal of the religious state was understood and ordered by the Lord in the Doctrine and Covenants when he called for the establishment of the temple at Kirtland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The verses, or at least some verses, very commonly quoted from section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, are of the Lord ordering the saints to build a temple. And this is what He says in section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p>Therefore verily I say unto you my friends, call your solemn assembly as I have commanded you. And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books, words of wisdom, seek learning, even by study and also by faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organize yourselves, prepare every needful thing, establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of Glory, a house of order, a house of God.</p>
<p>Which refers explicitly to the temple but also I think for the community of saints that would surround and contribute to and learn from and be part of that temple life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That your incomings may be in the name of the Lord; that your outgoings may be in the name of the Lord; that all your salutations may be in the name of the Lord; with uplifted hands unto the most high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appoint yourselves a teacher and let not all these spokesman at once but one speak at a time and let all listen unto a saying that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all and that every man may have an equal privilege. See that ye love one another. [And I&rsquo;ll come back to that phrase.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order of the house prepared for the presidency of the school of the prophets established for their instruction in all things that are expedient for them. Even for all the officers of the Church or in other words, those who are called to the ministry in the Church beginning at the high priests even down to the deacons.</p>
<p>And then He says this very interesting thing, and these are verses that are not often looked at:</p>
<p>This shall be the order of the house of the presidency of the school: he that is appointed to be president or teacher shall be found standing in his place in the house that shall be prepared for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He shall be first in the house of God and when he cometh into the house of God for he should be first in the house, behold, this is beautiful for he should be an example.</p>
<p>And what does he do when he enters the house?</p>
<p>Let him offer himself in prayer upon his knees before God in token or remembrance of the everlasting covenant.</p>
<p>And when any shall come in after him, let the teacher arise and with uplifted hands to heaven, yea even directly, salute his brother or brethren with these words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Art thou a brother or brethren, I salute you in the name of Lord Jesus Christ in token or remembrance of the everlasting covenant.</p>
<p>And then I love these lines:</p>
<p>In which covenant I receive you to fellowship in a determination that is fixed, immovable, and unchangeable to be your friend and brother through the grace of God in the bonds of love. To walk in all the commandments of God, blameless and thanksgiving, forever and ever, amen.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we arrive at this determination&mdash; a determination that is fixed, immoveable, and unchangeable; to be one another&rsquo;s friends, brothers and sisters, and to keep the commandments together forever? How do we live and learn in a religious community of such varied experiences and personalities, such varied sins and strengths, and with people we may not even like very much sometimes. Because I submit to you that this is what we must do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So some years ago, when I was a graduate student in Berkley, California, my husband, who was not yet my husband at the time, he and I went to see a movie at a theater in Palo Alto, California not far from the Stanford campus. It was a movie called <em>35 Up</em> and this movie was actually the most recent iteration in a series, a documentary series that had been made by British filmmakers beginning many years earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first film in the series was called <em>7 Up</em> which has nothing to do with the soda pop, but was instead this group of film makers who went and gathered this array of seven-year-old British school children. They filmed them and interviewed them and talked to them about their lives. They took children from a great variety, very many different walks of life; kids who were bound for Eaton and Oxford and other children who had very different futures in line for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had never heard of this series, until we went to see <em>35 Up</em>. We sat through the interviews and the conversations with this array of people who had been interviewed every seven years of their lives ever since they had been seven. Some had dropped out and ceased to be a part of the project, others were still very much involved with the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final individual, who was featured in this film, was a man whose life was troubled at best. He was actually doing apparently quite a lot better at thirty-five than he had been doing at twenty-eight. My future brother-in-law&rsquo;s wife, my future sister-in-law turned to me and said, &ldquo;In <em>28 Up</em> he was homeless and living in a trailer.&rdquo; He was a man who clearly had some issues and I, as I said, was living in Berkeley at the time not far from campus. I would walk to and from campus every day for course work and then back to my apartment. The walk to and from campus would take me along a not very clean street in Berkeley that was filled with panhandlers and drug addicts. When I saw this man in the film, the first thought that occurred to me was, if I saw him in Berkeley, I would cross the street to avoid him. That&rsquo;s the kind of individual I would tend to shy away from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in <em>35 Up</em> this hadn&rsquo;t been the case, you didn&rsquo;t just see the man at 35. They showed clips from all of the earlier movies from <em>7 Up</em>, from <em>14 Up</em>, from 21, 28. And so instead of just seeing this deeply troubled, disturbing figure at thirty-five, I also saw the boy. And this boy was beautiful, bright-eyed, vibrant, intelligent, articulate, little lad&mdash;completely loveable. Because I had seen the child, I found myself perfectly capable of loving the man because I had some idea of who he really was: of that innocence, of that beauty, of that energy that had characterized him as a seven-year-old. And it completely transformed my perception of him as an adult. Instead of thinking, &ldquo;I would run from that person,&rdquo; I felt drawn to him. I felt great compassion and great and quite real love for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It occurred to me then and it has occurred to me many times in the years since, that this is how and why parents are perfectly capable of loving us as teenagers. I have some teenagers and they&rsquo;re great and I love them. I mean they&rsquo;re quite adorable and pleasant now as they were as small children. But it occurred to me, too, that this gave me at least a little glimpse in to how our Heavenly Father can see us. He doesn&rsquo;t just know the flawed mortal you. He knows who you really are and He can see that and He loves it. If we can see something of that in one another, if we can just see a glimpse of that, how it can transform our sense of one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me read to you some of the most quoted verses in all of scripture from chapter 13 from 1 Corinthians. But, I&rsquo;ll place a little bit of emphasis on one of the final verses in that chapter is not discussed much. So in chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians, Paul says famously:</p>
<p>Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charity suffereth long and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, and thinketh no evil;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth: But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease, whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall be done away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</p>
<p>And then verse twelve:</p>
<p>For now we see through a glass, darkly: but then face to face: now I know in part: but then shall I know even as I also am known. Now abideth faith, hope, charity these three but the greatest of these is charity. <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>How do we arrive at and live in that fixed determination to truly be each other&rsquo;s brothers and sisters? The Lord Himself tells us when he says in Doctrine and Covenants 88, &ldquo;That ye love one another.&rdquo; This can be read and regularly is and is reasonably read to mean, &ldquo;see to it that you love one another.&rdquo; It is a commandment to love, but perhaps it is also a commandment to see. Because when we are given a glimpse, when we have that rare insight, and really see and know who someone is, then we can learn to value them; forgive and love that person, even if that person is myself. And that vision transforms us individually and collectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is no accident that Paul&rsquo;s promise of a future where we no longer see through a glass darkly, where we know even as we are known, follows his discourse on charity. That clear vision is mediated by love. There will come a time when we do see clearly; when we know even as we also are known; when we see and know as God sees and knows; and when we see as He sees, we cannot help but see others and ourselves for what they and we truly are. And when we see we cannot help but love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we need is to see others and ourselves with God&rsquo;s gracious eyes. He knows not only the purity and potential of our mortal childhood, like the glimpse I caught of a child in a documentary. But the divinity and destiny of our pre-mortal spirit, we must pray as Mormon teaches, with all the energy of heart that we may be filled with this love. Because it in only with the clear vision that comes with love that we are able to see our truest selves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Heavenly Father sees you and He loves what He sees. I love what I have seen here too, and pray that you may love and learn from one another in this wonderful community of students and saints. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been over five years since we last came to this beautiful campus. There have been so many changes since we were last here. There are amazing physical changes like this new assembly center and the beautiful temple on the hill, shedding its light over all. Additionally, I feel a change in the way people think about BYU&ndash;Idaho. There is a powerful learning spirit on this campus that is reaching beyond the students attending school here in Rexburg. We have felt the effects of the education outreach ideas being developed here, in other cities, even as far away as Boston. How blessed we are to have men and women like President and Sister Kim Clark who see a vision of what changes are possible and have the energy to work until it becomes a reality. This campus is a witness of the tremendous growth that can come from inspired change and wise leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we were last here, we were days from leaving for an undetermined length of time in Africa. The effects of change were about to descend upon us. In March of 2007, President Monson called us into his office with the intent, we assumed, to tell us where our next assignment would be. After visiting with us for nearly an hour he stood, telling us how much he had enjoyed our visit and signaling that the visit was about to conclude. As we walked towards the door he said, &ldquo;Did I mention where you are going?&rdquo; We answered no; we didn&rsquo;t think so. &ldquo;Oh, you are going to Africa.&rdquo; With those six words, he changed our lives forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea of how big a geographic change this was to us, Sister Koelliker had never in her entire life lived outside her zip code. Now at age sixty-five, we found ourselves in Johannesburg South Africa. There isn&rsquo;t a zip code that is further from Salt Lake City than Southeast Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to Africa, we had lived in a world of temples for ten years, having worked with President Hinckley to build seventy-two new temples, for a total of 124 operating temples under the direction of the Temple Department. Our every waking hour seemed to be about temples. Now we were going to a land where there was just one temple. This was for us a total change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes these changing moments present themselves suddenly and we find ourselves feeling uncomfortable as we are pulled or pushed into unfamiliar surroundings before we are ready. Maybe you felt some of that discomfort on your first day of attending school here or the first few days of being in the mission field. Initially, many of us resist change, and we find ourselves happy to stay with present conditions. On the other hand, recognizing and accepting change as being good and looking for positive aspects can allow for significant learning and progress to occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we embrace change, we discover it to be a principle of growth rather than a trial. I&rsquo;ve come to call change the principle of &ldquo;continuous learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being open to &ldquo;continuous learning&rdquo; has led to the discovery of other important principles. One of the significant principles contributing to our learning is the gift of agency. This gift of agency offers us the opportunity to choose the path we will follow to reach our foreordained destiny. The gift of agency is a wonderful privilege, but it comes with responsibilities and consequences. We have our agency to choose, but the consequences of our choices are generally fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choosing righteous principles and patterns to live by keeps us on the path leading to happiness. Choosing the plan of happiness gives us freedom and eternal life. The consequences of following unrighteous principles and patterns are equally certain. They will lead to misery that binds us with selfishness and loss of light. The effort of Lucifer is to distract and entice us to be relaxed and comfortable. Usually he attracts us in the most simple and seemingly innocent ways&mdash;a suggestive movie here or missing of morning or evening prayer there. His best line is: &ldquo;There is plenty of time to change later. Let&rsquo;s have some fun for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Lord blessed us at birth with His light and offers to us opportunities to receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit. When we feel the light of Christ and choose to seek for his promised spiritual gifts, the Lord promises to give us confirmation that the path we are on is correct or that it is time to make needed changes. Being able to recognize the voice of the Holy Spirit is critical to our being able to choose truth over distraction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Koelliker and I have prayed that the Gifts of the Spirit would be here today to bless each of us with light. The scriptures call these kinds of experiences as being edified. To be edified is to feel of the light and learn from it. We have specifically prayed that you individually might be inspired in some specific way to know what the Lord would have you learn from choosing to be here in this devotional today. I know the Lord loves each of you individually and specifically, and my witness and experience is He will speak to you individually and specifically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I share with you a pattern that might help you as you listen to the message the Lord would have you hear today? This pattern works any time you are in a meeting such as this, or a classroom, or a sacrament meeting, or a conference, or similar setting where you have the opportunity to listen for spiritual promptings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a sheet of paper and draw a line down the center of the page. On one side of the line list the important facts or comments made by the speaker or teacher that you want to remember. On the other side list the spiritual promptings or thoughts that came to your mind while you were listening. Then later in the day or evening, go back to your notes and find a scriptural reference or conference address that uses the word you were prompted to write. As you humbly ponder your thoughts and the scriptures, the Holy Spirit will expand your understanding regarding the thought you were prompted to write down during the earlier meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Joseph F. Smith, the fifth president of the Church in this dispensation, applied this pattern in his own personal study process and received the marvelous vision he recorded in section 138 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Listen to the testimony he bore of this pattern: &ldquo;As I pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effectively applying this pattern will increase your capacity to hear God&rsquo;s messages for you. By receiving His guidance, your grip (hold) on the Rod of Iron described by father Lehi in the Book of Mormon will be more firm and you will be able to stay on the path that leads to the Tree of Life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the ultimate goal to &ldquo;change&rdquo; ourselves from natural men and women to becoming worthy sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father.<sup> </sup>In speaking of that Tree-of-Life path, Lehi warned us of the pitfalls that await us if we don&rsquo;t discover and live our lives according to the patterns prepared by our Father in Heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The callings we receive often open the door to discovery of patterns and give us opportunity to make changes needed for us to build relationships that have eternal consequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it turns out, our calling to serve in Africa led to four years of the most profound learning experiences of our lives. If you will forgive a few personal stories and references, I will try to share some of the principles and patterns we discovered that have blessed our lives and drawn us closer to each other as a husband and wife, to our family, both immediate and extended, and to our Heavenly Father and His son, the Lord Jesus Christ. We can with surety say, we have been blessed by change or being open to continuous learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One pivotal learning experience occurred in the central part of Africa in the Republic of the Congo. The village of Luputa is a community of about 250,000 people. There was no central water system to support the daily needs of the people. Missionaries found it difficult to teach people, because they were always walking to obtain water to meet their daily water needs. The women of the village walked about thirty-five kilometers (twenty miles) to a spring where they loaded a forty-pound water container and then returned home carrying the container on their head. It took about eight hours a day to obtain their water for cooking, washing, drinking, bathing and all other needs. There was precious little time left in the day to do anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing this commitment to provide clean water for their families, the Church offered to assist the villages by building a reservoir and distribution system for the community. The villagers would have to sacrifice their time and energy to dig the trench for the water line from the spring to the reservoir. The Church bought the pipe and built the concrete water stations. It took three years of hard work and sacrifice to dig the trench, but with the installation completed, the women now only had to walk an average of fifteen to twenty minutes to obtain their water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just think of the change that brought into their lives. Now they had time to care for their children, read, learn and serve each other. In changing their time commitment to obtaining water, the people of Luputa now had time to listen to the message of the gospel. Within one year of putting the new pipes in place, over two thousand people had joined the Church. In June of 2011 the tenth stake was organized in the Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accepting change as a catalyst for growth usually causes a person to go through a time of struggle. Struggle is when we realize that it is hard to change and we wonder if it is worth it. To progress forward out of the experience of struggle, usually requires a willingness to sacrifice. To sacrifice means to forgo, to surrender, to give away, to let go of something we own or possess. It could be an idea, or an opinion or a belief, or a tradition. The people of Luputa were strapped with the means of providing water to their homes. To dig the trench, would be a significant sacrifice of time and energy. The only way their life would change was to make the sacrifice.</p>
<p>When we face significant change we are positioned for new understanding and potential growth. Sacrifice is the first principle we must learn and yield ourselves to, in order to really participate in growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi had to deal with this principle on many occasions. At the direction of his prophet father, Nephi and his brothers returned to Jerusalem to retrieve the records of the Jews and the genealogy of the family. Laman and Lemuel became more resistant to the journey and the mission, while Nephi and Sam were willing to make every effort to do as their father had instructed. Laman drew the responsibility to go to Laban to retrieve the records. He was unsuccessful and returned to his brothers empty handed and with the followers of Laban close in pursuit. Laman was irritated with the results of his venture and proceeded to take out his frustrations on Nephi, which included hitting him with a rod. At this point I&rsquo;m sure Nephi was in the midst of struggle. He must have thought, &ldquo;How am I going to deal with my older brother?&rdquo; let alone how was he going to get these records. I can imagine Nephi pleading with God asking him for help. At that moment of struggle when he felt he was to be sacrificed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto them, saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you, and this because of your iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an instant, Nephi&rsquo;s prayer in the midst of his struggle was answered. He had new knowledge and renewed confidence. His faith led him to an even stronger position with his brothers. And even though Laman and Lemuel had received the same vision of the angel, they had not grown but continued to murmur saying, &ldquo;How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi on the other hand now had sure knowledge of his mission and responsibility. He responded by saying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands? Therefore let us go up; the Lord is able to deliver us.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Nephi demonstrated that the will of his Father in Heaven was more important than his own life. The principle of sacrifice teaches us to place God&rsquo;s will ahead of our will or personal preferences or desires. Then are we able to clearly hear His voice and receive His guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When facing trial or moments of struggle, we often ask, &ldquo;Why am I in this situation?&rdquo; Or worse, &ldquo;Why has the Lord allowed me to suffer so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps one should ask a different question, such as &ldquo;What should I be learning, or how will this experience help me or someone in my circle of influence draw closer to God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider what you might do if placed in this situation. Early one morning, one of our senior couples serving in South Africa was awakened by a loud knocking at his door. Upon answering the door Elder Packer found two uniformed, armed policemen. They instructed him to dress and that he needed to come with them. They arrested him and placed him in a holding cell with all of the men who had been arrested that night. Some were intoxicated; some had committed robberies and many other offenses. He remained in the cell some nine hours and amazingly was not accosted or hurt. While in the cell, he asked himself, &ldquo;Why would the Lord allow me to be placed here? He must have something in mind.&rdquo; He decided to discover the reason, and so he began speaking with the men. He even persuaded some to begin singing a few hymns with him. He realized, though innocent, there was an opportunity to stop worrying about himself and begin worrying about those around him. In other words, he put the needs of others ahead of his own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the day concluded, the missionary was being called &ldquo;Elder&rdquo; by the prisoners. They not only sang the hymns but they defended the missionary from less-than-honorable jail mates. He befriended several who were as innocent as he was. Many were blessed by the Lord through Elder Packer&rsquo;s sacrifice; and Elder Packer was lifted to a new level of understanding and vision of how the Lord can use him, even in prison. Forgetting his own discomforts, he placed others ahead of his feelings and fears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Satan will constantly seek to distract us and teach us to be self-centered in our thinking and seek to protect our rights and privileges. But that was his plan from the beginning as he spoke in the councils of heaven. We were all present as Father made His plan known. The scripture records this moment:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Satan . . . came before me, saying&mdash;Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me&mdash;Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that moment we were all introduced to a foundational pattern that we should never forget and always seek to apply. As we learn how to apply this pattern, we are drawn into a thought process familiar to that of the Savior&rsquo;s. The Savior&rsquo;s words describe the pattern best:</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you&mdash;that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>His whole purpose to come to this world was &ldquo;to do the will of his Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Monson has also taught us this pattern. He speaks of a painting of the Savior that hangs on the wall in his office. Whenever he is faced with a decision of what he should do, he thinks of the picture and asks himself, &ldquo;What would the Savior do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scriptures both warn us and advise us of Satan&rsquo;s efforts to distract us. To preserve and protect us from these evil designs the Lord gave us the following instruction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His counsel is very clear. He will give us patterns or guidelines in not just a few things but the scripture says &ldquo;in all things,&rdquo; thus providing a template or a formula for staying on course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why do we need these patterns? The warning is equally clear, <em>&ldquo;Satan is abroad in the land and he goeth forth deceiving the nations.</em>&rdquo; It is clear that no one is exempt from his design to cause us to think as he thinks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord gives us further instruction regarding His patterns that will protect us from Lucifer&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>Wherefore he that prayeth, whose spirit is contrite, the same is accepted of me if he obey mine ordinances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He that speaketh, whose spirit is contrite, whose language is meek and edifieth, the same is of God if he obey mine ordinances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And again, he that trembleth under my power shall be made strong, and shall bring forth fruits of praise and wisdom, according to the revelations and truths which I have given you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In these verses we find the key actions that will lead us back to Him: They are to pray, be humble, submissive and to &ldquo;obey mine ordinances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our choice to qualify to receive His ordinances and keep the associated covenants allows us to pass through a door leading to the sacred halls of the temple where angels wait to nurture us and bless us with knowledge and power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mentioned there is only one temple in the Southeast part of Africa. The average member lives 2100 miles from the temple. That is the equivalent of Salt Lake to Chicago. To participate in these sacred ordinances is a major sacrifice for most people. They often come only once or twice in their lifetime. May I share a brief video with you of one of the groups of Saints who came from one of the closer countries to the temple? It only took them fifteen hours each way. Look at their eyes and faces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Video Clip Temple trip from Zimbabwe.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you see the happiness in their eyes and faces for having made the sacrifice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second principle of growth is obedience. Our prophet leaders have taught us that obedience is the first law of heaven. Obedience reflects our outward commitment to our inner testimony. It is this inner conviction that expresses our pure consecration to being disciples of Christ and servants to all of God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon is filled with examples of those who have applied this principle, and thereby testify of the deep love the Lord has for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it was with Nephi. His willingness to place the will of the Lord ahead of possibly losing his life brought Nephi to a new level of understanding. Being willing to yield his will to the Lord&rsquo;s led Nephi to this second principle of growth, obedience to God&rsquo;s commandments. Nephi&rsquo;s witness is very clear as he declared:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us. And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records, that we may preserve unto our children the language of our fathers; 20 And also that we may preserve unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, which have been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down unto this present time.<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Aligning our lives with His standards opens the door of the temple to us. He promises as we come to this holy place, He will guide us and send us forth with protection:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That thy servants may go forth from this house armed with thy power, and that thy name may be upon them, and thy glory be round about them, and thine angels have charge over them.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>The third growth principle is the giving of service to others in the pattern of the Savior. The action word for love is service. The Lord&rsquo;s pattern of service is best exemplified in the garden of Gethsemane. There the Lord served each of us as He took upon himself the sins of all mankind. He suffered and paid the price for us purely because He loves us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The love exemplified by the Savior&rsquo;s atonement for our sins cannot possibly be fully understood by our earthly limitations. Within these limitations we, nevertheless, strive to learn to develop and apply this Christ-centered pattern. The African culture has many traditions that are reflective of pure caring and love for family and for their fellow man. For example, no person would ever be turned away hungry from a neighbor or friend who had something to eat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A father in a household would sometimes have to travel to far away countries to find employment enough to provide for his wife and children. I will long remember a street vendor in Johannesburg who was from Zimbabwe. We had need of some beaded animals for a charity function. One of our committee people approached this street vendor to provide the gifts. She ordered 60 beaded zebras. The order was so large it exceeded the vendor&rsquo;s supply of beads. The person placing the order agreed to loan him the money to buy supplies. He completed the project and she picked them up and paid for them. &nbsp;As she gave him his money, he began to weep. She asked him why and he responded that the money she had given him would feed his family and extended family for six months. He was leaving that night for the fifteen-hour bus ride home to deliver the earnings to his family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Love of family is very strong in Africa. There is a strong belief in life beyond the grave. This in part comes from the high death rate in the population. Children will often have several mommas or women who lovingly care for them. Many mothers die in birth or from prevalent diseases and so orphanages are many and full. We often visited several orphanages near our home. Because of this special feeling for those who have passed away, there is a real sense of happiness when new members learn of the temple and the promises for their deceased love ones. They understand immediately the hope these temple blessings represent for their loved ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley said the expression of love that is most nearly like the Saviors, is the love shown by those who search out the names of their kindred dead and then take their names to the temple and perform the ordinances for them. In this service, one performs an act of service for them, which they cannot do for themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So often we think of service, like home or visiting teaching, almost as an obligation or a duty&mdash;something that if we do not do, we are somehow shirking our responsibility and we will be punished. The most powerful motivator for service should be our love for each other. When we act in love or out of charity, we serve in the pattern of the Savior. Serving out of love is the fundamental relationship in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The question every home and visiting teacher should ask his or her self is, &ldquo;Have I shown love to my families this week or today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This leads me to the fourth principle in the growth process. It is to build relationships of trust and reliability, being trustworthy leads to learning about joy. Joy is a condition of happiness coming from righteous living. Joy is being an instrument in God&rsquo;s hand to bring some soul to make changes and to repent.<a href="#_edn2" target="_self">[2]</a> &nbsp;One of the scriptural patterns for building righteous relationships leading to joy is found in D&amp;C 121. Here it describes relationships built on persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness and meekness, and love unfeigned, kindness, and pure knowledge, charity towards all, and unceasing virtuous thoughts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the tragedies of self-centered relationships is the loss of trust. Anger and selfishness are at the heart of the plan of misery as authored by Lucifer. When we feel anger, we can be assured that it is not from heaven and we are in great need of change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Joy is the ultimate purpose of mortal life. Nephi taught, &ldquo;Men are that they might have joy.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#_edn3" target="_self">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And from the Savior himself we learn the pattern leading to joy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. <a href="#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fullness of joy is described as the eternal inseparable relationship of body and spirit, living in the presence of our Father in Heaven with our eternal companions&mdash;to me that is the meaning of bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An experience that gave me a brief glimpse of joy occurred in the Johannesburg Temple. I will long remember Sister Angela of Mozambique. She and her husband were newly baptized members. They had a twelve-year-old son who suffered from muscular dystrophy and was wheelchair bound. We met them at a district conference just two weeks after their baptism. Their countenance was brilliant and they already looked forward to going to the temple to be sealed as a family. He had been called to serve as ward choir leader. Just two weeks after meeting them, Sister Angela&rsquo;s husband left early Sunday to rehearse with the choir. As he crossed the street near his home, he was hit by a vehicle and died at the scene. Their lives, which had been filled with hope, were suddenly shattered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About elven months later, my wife and I were attending a session in the Johannesburg Temple. I looked around the room and saw Sister Angela sitting in the room. She was more radiant than I had remembered. She was there to be sealed to her husband and their son. She whispered, &ldquo;I feel he is here with us today.&rdquo; In the tragic loss, she was blessed to see beyond her present state to glorious eternal view. With a perfect brightness of hope, she was in the temple to carry on the vision. The Lord does allow us to peek through celestial windows on occasion helping us to know of His love beyond the trials of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These principles of sacrifice, obedience, service, and trust are reflective of the covenants we make with our Heavenly Father that will lead us back to Him. The patterns of prayer, submissiveness, following the prophets, keeping commitments, and expressing love will help us &ldquo;change&rdquo; and thereby achieve our promised destiny. As we get these patterns correct in &ldquo;our&rdquo; own lives, then we must endure to the end. Elder Nelson has counseled us that enduring means looking beyond ourselves and helping others see the path home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had this thought burned into my heart on a dirt road in the middle of the Congo. Three days into a seven-day journey we stopped our vehicle at a bridge. As we stopped, a group of children ran up to our car and began their daily effort to sell us something or hope that we would share some food with them. One little girl seemed particularly attentive to us. She pressed her nose against our car window and spoke in her native language. I had no idea what she was saying and so all I could do was smile at her. The idea popped into my mind to see if she could mimic the words I might say to her. So pointing at my mouth I said, &ldquo;you say what I&rsquo;m saying&rdquo;. Magically she seemed to understand. So I said, &ldquo;I&rdquo; and she repeated &ldquo;I&rdquo;. I said, &ldquo;am&rdquo; and she repeated, &ldquo;am&rdquo;. I said &ldquo;a child&rdquo;, she repeated &ldquo;a child&rdquo;. I said, &ldquo;of God&rdquo; she repeated &ldquo;of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am a child of God&rdquo; and she repeated &ldquo;I am a child of God&rdquo;. The mission president with whom we were riding began to sing the hymn. She looked at him and seemed to be thinking. At that moment the bridge guard waved us forward, and we left the children standing there. We travelled about fifty feet and were stopped again. Instantly the same little girl ran to our window and as clearly as any little child could say she repeated, &ldquo; I am a child of God&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anything changed for her, but my life view changed and it will never be the same. For me there was a window of light that opened in my mind and I recognized that all of these wonderful people of Africa were also loved children of our Heavenly Father who had stood in that grand pre-earth council of heaven with their arms fully extended in support of the Fathers plan to bring us home. They too had sustained the Savior&rsquo;s proposal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realized more clearly the expectation of our brothers and sisters from that pre-earth experience, to find them and help them remember who they are. In the spirit of love we promised to find them or at a minimum do the work for them in the holy temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is my witness to you that we are children of our Heavenly Father, whether here in the relative comforts of BYU&shy;&ndash;&shy;I or in the deepest villages of Africa. I know we have a responsibility to find and remind or at least find and perform the ordinances of salvation for our brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>I testify that Jesus Christ is the literal Son of God who came to earth because of His total devotion to His Father and His complete love of us. It is in that spirit that He leads this His church today and encourages us to live in that pattern. The Father&rsquo;s plan teaches us how to love Him and His children.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I learned in the Church there is one universal language&mdash;that is the spirit of the Lord. I pray that the spirit of God be with us and that we may edify [one another] and communicate by the Holy Spirit. After thirty-four years of my ministry as a Seventy of the Church, I left the first acting service of the Seventy and now I teach institute class: the Davis County Singles Young Adult Stake, and this is my third semester teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This semester I [am] teaching how to be an escort and how to be married successfully. I invite you to prepare for that but I challenge you first to serve a mission. I teach also Sunday School class in the ward and I work also at the temple as a temple sealer. But the second semester this year, a young man, a returned missionary, who serves as an assistant to the president and I won&rsquo;t say which mission, and [with] tears in his eyes, he said, &ldquo;Brother Kikuchi, I have a problem. Since I returned from my mission my spirituality is really not what it ought to be. Would you help me so that I can get back to the spirit of the mission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Before I answer that question, could I ask something? What time [do] you usually sleep? What time [do] you get up? And what [are the] activities in the morning as you get up?&rdquo; And so on and so on. And so I ask, &ldquo;What time [are] you planning to go to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about one o&rsquo;clock and sometimes two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you studying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Then what time you get up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I have to take a bus to the school and I need to get up at least thirty minutes [before].&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Can you freshen up within that few minutes and then catch the bus? Do you have a breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, most of the time I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, is there anything of the special things you do to communicate with Heavenly Father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I read the scriptures occasionally but not steady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have a chance to visit with Heavenly Father often and in a steady way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;He said, no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are a little far from Heavenly Father now. May I suggest the prescriptions for you if you are willing to listen to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;He said, &ldquo;I would do anything I need to [get the] spirit back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Then, I said, &ldquo;When I became a General Authority and I was called, and one of the presidency of the Seventy trained me. [He told me] when he was called, he asked President David O. McKay, &lsquo;President McKay what should I do to deepen my spirituality?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;And [President McKay answered] pointing at five fingers and I hope you remember:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arise early. I wash my body and I put my new linen and those of us [who have] been through the temple the holy garment. Then, I subdue my spirit&mdash;number four&mdash;before God; I am kneeling before Heavenly Father. Number five,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wait for the inspiration of the Holy Father in Heaven. When I do that I come home, come back, and I am immersed into the scriptures daily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, this man that trained me&mdash;he really, really taught [me well]&mdash;and he was convinced [by President McKay] that he really should do [these things]. And [in turn] he really convinced me and I believe that the best methods&mdash;[this] simple prescription&mdash;[are the best] methods I have heard. So my brothers and sisters&mdash;I did [them].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then a few days later and almost a week later [the young man&rsquo;s] countenance was different and his demeanor [was] changed and this time it&rsquo;s different tears. He expressed profound, profound love for Heavenly Father and closeness to his Savior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenant 88 section, verses 62 to 63 says, &ldquo;This is a commandment I given unto you while I&rsquo;m near.&rdquo; Listen to these words of the Lord. &ldquo;While I&rsquo;m near, draw near to me, I draw near unto you.&rdquo; I believe the Lord is always nearby us, but He asks us to initiate, to come closer to Him. He said, &ldquo;While I&rsquo;m near, draw near unto me, I draw near unto you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, this is the most glorious principles of moral agency. If you and I can exercise our agency to take time and effort to come closer to the Lord I [have] found that the Lord comes to us. So [had] this young man, and he was a so appreciative. And he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in Stake Conference in the south from here&mdash;a little south almost to Utah&mdash;in Preston, Idaho. We [were] organizing the stake presidencies and I interviewed probably forty-eight priesthood brethren. Oh, my. Probably fifteen of them can be capable to serve, but I didn&rsquo;t feel good. So [I asked] my companion, Area Seventy Elder Fish, &ldquo;Do you think we ought to continue to interview?&rdquo; He said yes we would. The last three persons came in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The first was the bishop. He was called only six months ago&mdash;a young man, forty-one years old, married, three children&mdash;and he was a bishop. Before he started talking to us, the Spirit of the Lord told us, told me, this is the man. So I said, &ldquo;Brother so-and-so, tell me [about] your relationship with the Savior and your relationship with the Heavenly Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Tears are streaming down from his cheeks. All those [other] 40, 50, or 60 people, they [were] all wonderful. Wonderful leaders. Capable leaders. But [these were] the first time humble tears came, and he couldn&rsquo;t tell his feelings about the Savior and Heavenly Father. The Spirit born witness to me again, this is the man I have chosen. I almost heard the Lord&rsquo;s voice. So finally he controlled his emotion and then said he has been trying to wake up in morning, early. He has been to the Provo MTC, went to the Barcelona Spain mission and now he&rsquo;s serving and married and [runs a] very successful car and tire business. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been doing this to cultivate my spirituality every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;And I said, &ldquo;Who taught you how to do so? Your mission president?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did, but you know that man who came?&rdquo; He was joking. I&rsquo;m [in] a serious meeting. &ldquo;This bald headed guy came and his name was Brother Kikuchi. You are the one [who] shared the Sacred Grove [experience] that I should have. Since that day, I&rsquo;ve been doing those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I humbly today [offer] a simple formula: follow President McKay&rsquo;s suggestion. Arise a little early, and then, wash and freshen up. Then put your new linen on, then jeans, [which is] fine&mdash;you don&rsquo;t need to dress in Sunday clothes. Find your secluded place. You don&rsquo;t need to go [to the] backyard. You don&rsquo;t need to get in between the trees on the snow, however, that [is a] very wonderful secluded place. Kneeling before God, communicate with Heavenly Father through the holy name of the Savior, Jesus Christ. I promise you in the name of Jesus Christ, I humbly promise you in the name of Jesus Christ your lives will be changed. The Spirit of God [will] come to you always [and be a] companion to your wonderful life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Eyring of the First Presidency lives in our stake in Bountiful, and Brother [Henry J.] Eyring here&mdash;he looks like his father. And President Taylor, Brian Taylor, our stake president, asked one time when he went to President Eyring&rsquo;s stake, while they were waiting for the sacrament and President Taylor whispered [in] his ear, &rdquo;What would you suggest, President Eyring, [that I do] as a Stake President to serve effectively?&rdquo; President Eyring whispered back &ldquo;[Come unto] Him again, then connecting, help the saints to connect with the Savior Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;And about two weeks before that, [when] I was a still an Acting Seventy, [President Taylor] came to my ward and whispered to my ears the same thing. &ldquo;What can I do to serve effectively as a Stake President?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;If I were you, I would help the brothers and sisters to come closer to Heavenly Father.&rdquo; My dear brothers and sisters, President Eyring is right. Let us more connect with the Savior and Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, when he was called as a young man as a bishop, his Sacred Grove [was] his chapel at a [the] pulpit, beneath the pulpit, [when] no one [was] around. That is his Sacred Grove. He [was] always kneeling, begging and pleading to Heavenly Father to help him. My dear brothers and sisters, my dear brothers and sisters, I humbly offer to you, [that] you and I could have own version of our Sacred Grove. Thus that you can commune with Heavenly Father; thus that you can communicate with the divine fellowship with Holy Father in heaven, daily, daily, [which] will cause us to communicate [better with Him].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I believe that morning is a symbol of the resurrection. I repeat morning is the symbol of the resurrection. How many mornings [do] you spend with Heavenly Father? Through the Savior Jesus Christ I know it [is] determined the degrees of glory, of happiness, of our own resurrection. My dear brothers and sisters, I humbly offer to you that you and I could have that personal Sacred Grove. Now that the Sacred Grove is not only for this young man that I taught after my class at Institute or the Stake President who is serving in Idaho.</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, the Sacred Grove story is effective [for] non-members also and brothers and sisters all over the world. I want to share, before I sit down, the story of Joseph Smith&rsquo;s Sacred Grove experience that affected his life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It happened in Japan some fifty years ago&mdash;almost fifty-four or &ndash;five. I, my dear brothers and sisters (four kids), mom and dad&mdash;[we] were happy. They [were a] Buddhist family. War broke out. Father was called to serve. Two weeks before the war ended, he became sick and came home. [He] found no food in his home. [All the] workers [were] gone. He took young people, and boys and also older people to catch fish. By two [o&rsquo; clock], his engine boats [had] caught a lot of fish. And they [were] heading to harbor and on the way&mdash;two weeks prior to the war ending&mdash;Americans and Marines bombed and killed these eight people except for one. A fourteen-year-old boy helping [catch fish], caught the debris and spent a day and a half to reach to the seashore. He told everything that [had] happened. This father left behind the four kids and of course the faithful wife and mother, who became poor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The family [of] four, the boy, [the] third child, when he graduated from his junior high, [there was] no money to send [him] to senior high school. So he found a little tiny shop, a bean curd shop made with soy beans, [and started] working from 4 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, making tofu. And [he] started selling in the morning for the breakfast, which everyone wanted. Then he would rest a little while and then make the tofu for the evening and rest, looking up at the stars. After 6, he changed, ate, and biked [to] the evening school. He came home at 10:30, and jumped into bed by 11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day he was found in a hospital bed, critically ill. His doctor could not diagnose anything. Brothers and sisters, [his] mother called, his big brother called, they said that they cannot make it; they could not help. Brothers and sisters, that night that little boy as a Buddhist boy, prayed, &ldquo;God are you there? Buddha are you there?&rdquo; No spirit, no angel, no lights&mdash;nothing.</p>
<p>He fell asleep and next morning was very fresh; after few days he left hospital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a Monday. Monday, [which was] missionary p-day, knocking doors p-day. They [were] knocking all day, however, no success. Then finally they decided to go home, but somehow, a young missionary from St. Anthony, Idaho, turned to [his] companion, &ldquo;Can we knock few more doors?&rdquo; They decided to knock a few doors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[They] came to the little boy [who] was staying in the grandmother&rsquo;s home. [He had] left that tofu shop because he got sick. He saw Americans. He was told they came from America. The boy said, &ldquo;You just go, I no like you guys. Americans, you kill my father&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The missionary took [off his] gentleman hat, [the] young man from St. Anthony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you, young man?&rdquo; the young man said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I said leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, this young missionary [said], &ldquo;We have a message for you. A message that your Heavenly Father came to a boy just like you and your Savior came to a boy just like you. We want to tell [you] a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The boy froze, &ldquo;I give you 10 minutes then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Missionary walked in and taught that little boy. That missionary taught so beautifully, &ldquo;I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head above the brightness of the sun.&rdquo; The missionary started crying, telling about the brightness of the sun &ldquo;which descended gradually until it fell upon me&hellip; When the light rest upon me, I saw two personages, whose brightness and glory defy all descriptions&hellip;One of them spake unto me, calling me by name pointing to the other&mdash;This is my beloved Son, hear Him.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know what? That Japanese boy believed them. Embarrassed, [he] asked them to come back. Somehow [the] missionaries came back every day, [though they] almost didn&rsquo;t know where to go. [They] taught that little boy, my dear brothers and sisters. He wanted to be baptized, but he was too young and needed permission. [He] called [his] mother, &ldquo;Mother I found a wonderful church. I want to join and be baptized. Two young men came from America.&rdquo; She hung up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That missionary fasted and prayed and the boy did also. [The] next day he called, &ldquo;Mother don&rsquo;t hang up. I&rsquo;ve found a wonderful church. Please give me permission.&rdquo; Almost ten minutes back and forth, he was begging and she was pleading [him] not to. Finally, [his] wise mother said, &ldquo;Son, you&rsquo;re too young to make a decision, but one condition, if you [do] not quit right in the middle, I&rsquo;ll let you join. Remember, don&rsquo;t you ever quit in middle.&rdquo; Missionaries took him the next day to biggest baptismal font, which [is] called [the] Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That young boy, that young boy was affected by the Sacred Grove [story] of Joseph Smith by [the] missionaries. My dear brothers and sisters, I have to sit down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may wonder who is that boy? Is that little boy still active in the Church? My dear brothers and sisters, I am, I am that little boy who said, &ldquo;No thank you, go away.&rdquo; Thank God [for] missionary work. Now, I want to make straight&mdash;[the] gospel changed my nature. I love you. I love you beautiful American people. May God bless all of us. I know [my] Father in Heaven [said] &ldquo;Behold this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;And [I know] Jesus stood in the Bountiful temple. &ldquo;Behold I am Jesus Christ whom the prophets testified shall come into the world&hellip; I have drunk thy bitter cup which my Father hath given me&rdquo;<a href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;for the sake of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love my Father in Heaven. I love my Savior. I love our prophet. And I love this Church. May God bless all of you to communicate with Heavenly Father more often is my humble prayer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was born in Monterrey, N.L. Mexico and lived in Mexico for the first six years of my life. My parents moved us to the Mesa, Arizona when I was about to begin the first grade. We settled in a very small home on seven acres in a small farming community, known as Lehi, located about three or four miles north of Mesa in the river bottoms of the Salt River valley. In my early childhood of living in the U.S. several things happened that influenced my feelings and attitude toward the temple, the House of the Lord. I can identify four specific happenings:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mesa Arizona Temple</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><em>Baptism in the temple</em></p>
<p>First, on the 5th of November 1949, a Saturday, I was baptized in the Mesa Arizona temple baptismal font with a good many other eight-year-olds. That was then the practice in the Mesa-Phoenix area. There were only two stakes in those days where today there are about sixty. I suspect that practiced was ceased sometime in the 1950s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Proxy baptism card</em></p>
<p>Second, primary children, after their own baptism, could serve as proxies for temple baptisms. I have a whole collection of the small cards the temple would give us each time we served as proxies for baptisms for the dead. Each card gives the date and the number of proxy baptisms performed. Here is one from January 19, 1952, showing I was proxy for twelve baptisms. I was ten years of age. Many years ago the Church began requiring youth to be at least twelve years of age to be proxies in baptisms for the dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Witnessing others sacrifice to attend the temple</em></p>
<p>Third, I have very clear memories of going to Mesa with my parents to greet the buses full of Mexican saints who had traveled for days on cramped un-air-conditioned buses to come to the temple in Mesa to receive their temple blessings. In their youth, both my parents had served missions in Mexico so they had many friends and acquaintances that would come on those buses. Today, as I ponder the kinds of sacrifices that those people made to come to the temple, I am amazed and humbled by their faith, dedication, and their fervent devotion to come to the temple. Many could tell of selling furniture or even their homes in order to have the funds for the entire family to come to the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Temple callings</em></p>
<p>The fourth thing I remember was when I was about nine years of age, our family had an experience that greatly impacted my understanding and feelings regarding the importance of the temple. My parents were called as temple workers to serve in the occasional Spanish sessions of the Mesa Temple. There were no &ldquo;temple films&rdquo; in those days and all the workers in the sessions had to speak the language of the session. My parents were both born and raised in Mexico and were fluent in both English and Spanish. That calling to serve in the temple created a serious problem for my parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were four young children in the family, I being the oldest, and there was no money in the family budget to pay a babysitter. My parents had always believed that you never turn down a calling from the Lord, so they felt considerable anguish over this calling that would take them away from their four small children in the evenings. In prayer they pleaded with the Lord for guidance in this matter. About this time a neighbor came to them with a dog, a large male tri-colored collie, and offered them the dog. The neighbor explained that the dog was a very intelligent dog which had received extensive obedience training and had competed in dog show obedience trials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dog was a registered pedigreed tri-color collie. His official name was &ldquo;Lucky Lad&rdquo;. We just called him Lucky. He was getting a bit old, but he loved children, and the neighbor thought our family would be a perfect environment for the dog to live out his &ldquo;golden years.&rdquo; My parents saw this as an answer to their prayers regarding the temple calling and the budget shortfall for baby sitters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So from that time forth, when my parents went to the temple in the evening, the four children of the Pratt family were left in care of a very intelligent tri-colored collie and a 9-year-old boy of questionable intelligence. I can tell you that dog was a very effective baby sitter. I remember an occasion when I got in an argument or fight with my next younger sister, in a flash old Lucky was between us and pushing me away. Lucky knew he was in charge. If ever anyone came to the door when Lucky was in charge, he was the one who decided whether they could be allowed into the home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the Pratt children survived that experience. But most significantly we began to understand the extreme importance of the temple in our parents&rsquo; lives and consequently in our own. Each of the Pratt children eventually married in the Mesa Arizona Temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I reached twelve years of age, we moved to a town quite distant from the temple and frequent temple visits were not possible for the parents or the children. In preparation for my mission, at nineteen years of age, I received my endowments in the Mesa Temple. I didn&rsquo;t really understand much about the ordinances and blessings I received that day. It wasn&rsquo;t until after my mission that I began to appreciate the profound spiritual strength that one can derive from the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My life as a missionary was orderly, organized, and focused. But as a recently returned missionary, I found my life much less orderly, less organized and less focused: university studies, work, personal finances, Church callings&mdash;girls!&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about that in the mission field. But I found that if I could just get to the temple things were better. I could go with my mind and spirit in turmoil and after two hours in the temple the turmoil had been replaced with a calm spirit of peace. I was renewed. I was focused. My goals were clear and I could proceed with confidence that I was doing the right things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While studying at the University of Arizona in Tucson, I met this extremely attractive young lady who happened to be a very faithful Presbyterian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I taught her the gospel, baptized her, and we were married on June 26, 1969, and sealed in the Mesa Temple. (That is the drastically shortened version of a wonderful and much longer story, but you&rsquo;ll have to get the juicy details some other time. Suffice it to say it took three years from first day to marriage.) At the time of our marriage, I had just finished my first year of law school at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our very humble home was located about twenty minutes from the temple. Together, my wonderful bride and I decided we would go to the temple at least once a week while we lived near a temple. We had no idea where we would live after law school or whether we would be near a temple. Remember, there were no temples east of the Rocky Mountains in those days. We decided to go on Thursday evenings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, Thursday evenings seemed the most complicated day of the week. Everything would go wrong to keep us from going to the temple. We learned, however, that if we persisted in our determination to go every Thursday, things began to go more smoothly. We both noticed that fact and commented on it. It was apparent the adversary didn&rsquo;t want us to go to the temple and he threw up all kinds of impediments, but if we were diligent in our goal he would eventually give up on us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next we learned the same thing I had earlier learned as a returned missionary, the temple is a place of peace. In our determination to be faithful to our goals we would occasionally go to the temple when we neither one felt very much like going. Maybe we had some disagreement or something that had left some tension in the air. That sort of thing probably happens to all young newlyweds trying to blend two lives into one. On those occasions we would drive the twenty minutes to the temple without a word between us. After the temple session, we could neither one remember what the tension was about or even that there had been any tension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the language of Isaiah, we had just spent two hours on &ldquo;the mountain of the Lord, in the house of the God of Jacob.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; The temple is, as it says over the door, the House of the Lord. His Spirit is there. It is a place of peace, of revelation, of drawing near to God. It is a place where one can feel the guidance of the Spirit and find answers to prayers. We can testify of the profound truth of President Monson&rsquo;s statement in April Conference 2011:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world can be a challenging and difficult place in which to live. We are often surrounded by that which would drag us down. As you and I go to the holy houses of God, as we remember the covenants we make within, we will be more able to bear every trial and to overcome each temptation. In this sacred sanctuary we will find peace; we will be renewed and fortified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those two years of going to the temple every week were precious to us because during much of our lives we have lived many thousands of miles from the nearest temple. For 34 years we have lived outside the United States and much of it far from the nearest temple. Whenever we have lived near a temple we have made it a practice to go every week. In the thirteen months since my release from the First Quorum of Seventy, we have been temple ordinance workers, and I have served as a sealer in the Las Vegas Temple. It has been a joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the most exciting and satisfying work in my career as South American Legal Counsel for the Church has been with building of temples. The first such case was the Sao Paulo Brazil Temple. When the temple was announced our stake in Montevideo, Uruguay, received an assessment to be paid in cash for the building of the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assessment was far beyond the financial capabilities of the members. But we all worked together to raise the money. Members contributed their family heirlooms, jewelry, wedding bands, and antiques to do their part. In addition, I had the privilege of being involved in the acquisition of property for the temple, in drafting the construction contract, in attending the groundbreaking and assuring the compliance of the contractor with the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sao Paulo Temple</strong></p>
<p>The Sao Paulo temple was the very first structure in South America to bear the words &ldquo;Holiness to the Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;House of the Lord&rdquo; over the entrance; in Portuguese, of course. As a matter of fact it was the very first temple built &ldquo;South of the Border.&rdquo; That temple was dedicated 34 years ago today, on October 30, 1978, by President Spencer W. Kimball. Karen and I had the blessing of attending all ten sessions of the temple dedication. I was invited to translate for the final session, which was in Spanish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the saints of South America, this was a previously unimaginable miracle. To that dedication members came from Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Many traveled for thousands of miles. The gospel had been preached in Argentina and Brazil for a half century, and generations had passed away without the blessings of the temple. Now it was within reach for them. Can you catch a glimpse of the excitement of those members? They had heard of the temple, they had seen pictures of temples, but temples were impossibly far away. When I was a missionary in Argentina fifty years ago, there may have been a dozen couples in the entire country sealed in the temple. The nearest temple was Mesa, Arizona&mdash;too far, too expensive, out of reach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For five full years, Sao Paulo Brazil was the only temple on the entire continent. In that five-year interim all the saints of South America who could afford it traveled to Sao Paulo for the temple. It was still a great distance, but the temple was in reach. It was more affordable for many. But for many more it was still an impossible dream, still too far, too expensive. Then came another miracle: The dedication of a temple in Santiago, Chile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Santiago Chile Temple</strong></p>
<p>The Santiago Chile Temple was the very first Spanish-speaking temple of the Church. President Gordon B. Hinckley, who was then a counselor to President Spencer W. Kimball, dedicated that temple on 15 September 1983. (I should add here that the Church&rsquo;s second Spanish-speaking temple, the Mexico City Temple, was dedicated only 3 months later on 2 December 1983, also by President Gordon B. Hinckley.) Again, Karen and I had the blessing of attending most of the ten dedicatory sessions in Santiago. The saints of Chile, Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia were overjoyed. The temple was now much, much closer. But still, for many of them it was still incredibly distant and unattainably expensive. For the saints of Lima, Peru, it was still 2,500 kilometers. That&rsquo;s much closer for them than the Sao Paulo Temple, which was 3,500 kilometers distant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me tell you about the saints of the Punta Arenas Chile Stake. Punta Arenas is located on the Straits of Magellan near the very southern tip of South America. It is 2,200 km from the Santiago Chile Temple. That&rsquo;s like living in Los Angeles and traveling to the temple in Kansas City, Missouri. In spite of the distance, every summer the stake sends at least one, and sometimes two, buses to the temple. It takes them three days to get to Santiago. They cross the Argentina/Chile border twice. They spend three days in the temple and make the three day trip back. They are grateful the temple is not further away<strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lima Peru Temple</strong></p>
<p>Another major shift in the accessibility of temple blessings occurred with the dedication of the Lima Peru Temple on 10 January 1986, by President Gordon B. Hinckley. What a marvelous miracle. Karen and I and our four oldest children were able to attendant the temple dedication. Our teenagers could now do temple baptisms!&nbsp; At the time of the dedication there were elven stakes in Lima and many more in the rest of the country. Temple blessings were now within the reach of so many more faithful members of the Church. It was still a huge distance for the saints of Bolivia and Ecuador, but even so the trip was less formidable than before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Buenos Aires Argentina Temple</strong></p>
<p>One week later, as part of that major shift in accessibility of temple blessings, the Buenos Aires Argentina Temple was dedicated 17 January 1986, by President Thomas S. Monson. The righteous saints of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay now had a temple much more within their economic reach. That temple has now been remodeled, expanded and rededicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bogota Colombia Temple</strong></p>
<p>On 24 April 1999, the Bogota Colombia Temple was dedicated by President Hinckley. Prior to its dedication the Colombian and Venezuelan saints were equidistant from the Lima Peru Temple and the Orlando Florida Temple; that is if they could afford the airfare. Until then many traveled by bus to the Lima Peru temple, usually a four-day trip for the Colombian saints and even further for the Venezuelans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will note a thirteen-year gap in South American temple dedications. For me, much of that time was spent in blood, sweat and tears over the legal problems that always tend to appear in purchasing temple properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Guayaquil Ecuador Temple</strong></p>
<p>Let me tell you a bit about the Guayaquil Temple. At the end of October 1991, President Hinckley came to a regional conference in Quito, Ecuador. Prior to the trip he expressed a desire to locate a property for the Guayaquil temple. He expressed sincere regret that in spite of being announced almost ten years earlier in April General Conference 1982, the temple was not yet built. The Area Real Estate office in Quito was charged with finding 5 or 6 properties for potential temple sites. I was charged with doing a preliminary title investigation to make certain the properties were of reasonably clear title. Together we narrowed it down to 6 well-located properties with reasonably clear titles that would be suitable temple sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the day President Hinckley went to Guayaquil to view the properties, I was not invited. Philippe Kradolfer, our Director of Temporal Affairs, later related the following story: President Hinckley didn&rsquo;t like any of the properties; he said they were &ldquo;too flat.&rdquo; At the last piece of property President Hinckley asked what lay beyond a line of trees that bordered the property. Brother Kradolfer told him it was &ldquo;swampland.&rdquo; (Now, if you know anything about Guayaquil, half the city is built on reclaimed swampland, and actually beyond the trees was a tidal waterway known in Guayaquil as an <em>estero</em>.) At this point President Hinckley started giving directions to the driver of the vehicle, telling him where to turn and when. They somehow got to the other side of the <em>estero</em> and came to a rough unpaved road leading up a steep slope. The road leads to the top of a hill which overlooks a huge section of the city of Guayaquil. President Hinckley walked around the hill in silence and then walking back to the car, he said, &ldquo;This feels like a temple site. See if it can be purchased!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Hinckley left directly from Guayaquil to return to the U.S.&nbsp; When Brother Kradolfer and the others returned to Quito, they were all very emotional in telling the story of having observed a prophet of God locate a temple site under inspiration from heaven. I had no doubt that the prophet had been guided by the Lord in finding that property. But when they described the property, I knew exactly which property it was. I groaned because I had already looked at the title and had rejected the property because its legal situation was a terrible mess, it would take years to clear it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what do you do when a prophet says, &ldquo;this feels like a temple property?&rdquo; Obviously you charge full speed ahead and do your best and pray for heaven&rsquo;s help. The property was identified on about November 1, 1991. The temple was dedicated in 1999, almost 8 years later. Most of that delay was due to the legal entanglements involved in purchasing the property, including subdivision approval, obtaining religious use, and building permit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process was complicated by the fact that the Guayaquil city government for some twenty years previous had been in control of the Bucaram family, Ecuadorians of Lebanese descent. Guayaquil was a mess. The government was extremely corrupt. The city was filthy and public services were a disaster. In 1994, the people rebelled and a new political movement elected as mayor a former president of the country, Leon Febres Cordero. He was known as an honest man who didn&rsquo;t tolerate any nonsense. He completely shut down the city hall for a month and hired a city manager, an experienced youthful Harvard-educated businessman to put order in the chaos that had been city government. During that month he had people working night and day to clean it up and put in all new office systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Little by little the new city government put order in the city and its services. Eventually, we were able to obtain all the approvals necessary to build the temple. The temple was dedicated on 1 August 1999. I have been back to Guayaquil many times since the dedication of the temple and Guayaquil is truly a different city. The traffic is more orderly, the city is cleaner, the parks are well maintained, and people are even more polite. The transformation from the city I knew in the 80s to what it is today is actually unbelievable. I have commented on that transformation to Guayaquil members of the Church. The universal response has been: it&rsquo;s the temple. The presence of the temple has changed the city. I cannot ever argue with that. Like those faithful saints of Guayaquil, I truly believe that the Lord was involved in improving their beautiful city. In the following years many more temples were built in South America. Let me quickly review them with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cochabamba Bolivia Temple</strong></p>
<p>The city of Cochabamba is located in a beautiful valley of the Andes at about 8,000 feet above sea level. I had the privilege of helping with locating the property, purchasing it, and participating in the groundbreaking. This temple was dedicated on April 30, 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Caracas Venezuela Temple</strong></p>
<p>This temple was dedicated on 20 August 2000. Until then, many Venezuelan saints had traveled to the Orlando Florida Temple for their temple blessings. With that dedication they were overjoyed to have a temple &ldquo;in their own backyard&rdquo; so to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recife Brazil Temple</strong></p>
<p>Brazil was the first country of South America to have multiple temples. The Recife Brazil Temple was the first of those, being dedicated on 15 December 2000. Recife is a major city in Brazil&rsquo;s huge northeast section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Porto Alegre Brazil Temple</strong></p>
<p>Brazil&rsquo;s third temple was the Porto Alegre Temple located in Brazil&rsquo;s southern-most state. It was dedicated two days after the Recife Temple, on 17 December 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Montevideo Uruguay Temple</strong></p>
<p>The Montevideo Uruguay Temple was dedicated on 18 March 2001. It is built on the same block where Karen and I lived as we began our South American adventure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Campinas Brazil Temple</strong></p>
<p>The Campinas Brazil Temple was Brazil&rsquo;s fourth temple. It was dedicated on 17 May 2002. Our daughter, Lisa, served in the Brazil Campinas mission, so this temple has special meaning for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Asuncion Paraguay Temple</strong></p>
<p>Two days later the Asuncion Paraguay Temple was dedicated on 19 May 2002. With the dedication of the Asuncion Temple finally every country of South American had its own temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Curitiba Brazil Temple</strong></p>
<p>Brazil&rsquo;s fifth temple, the Curitiba Brazil Temple was dedicated on 1 June 2008. Four those five temples are located in southern Brazil where the largest concentration of members lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Manaus Brazil Temple</strong></p>
<p>The Manaus Brazil Temple was dedicated a little over 4 months ago on 10 June 2012, and is truly a miracle for the saints of Manaus. The city of Manaus is in the heart of the Amazon basin, literally a thousand miles from nowhere. While I was Area President of the South America North Area the saints of Manaus would travel three days by bus to come to the temple in Caracas, Venezuela, Now they have their own temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I have reviewed with you the 15 existing dedicated temples of South America. But the story doesn&rsquo;t end there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cordoba Argentina Temple </strong></p>
<p>Exactly two years ago today the groundbreaking of the Cordoba Argentina Temple was held on 30 October 2010. This is Argentina&rsquo;s second temple. With the imaging technology the architects have today, they can show us a pretty accurate picture of what the finished temple will look like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trujillo Peru Temple</strong></p>
<p>Last year, on 14 September 2011, the groundbreaking of the Trujillo Peru Temple was held, Peru&rsquo;s second temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Temples announced for South American </strong></p>
<p>Four more temples have been announced for South America, but have not yet had their groundbreaking ceremony. Each of them was announced in an October General Conference: Concepcion Chile and Fortaleza Brazil were announced in 2009. Concepcion is Chile&rsquo;s second temple, and Fortaleza is Brazil&rsquo;s seventh. Barranquilla Colombia Temple was announced in 2011, Colombia&rsquo;s second temple. Arequipa Peru Temple was announced less than a month ago in General Conference. Arequipa will be Peru&rsquo;s third temple.</p>
<p>I remember too clearly my days as a missionary in Argentina, when there were no temples and no stakes in all of South America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, fifty years later, to have twenty-one temples dedicated or announced is a miracle. There is no other word for it: a miracle. And because I have been involved in the process of building so many of them, I can testify of many miracles I have seen in the building of each one of the these gorgeous temples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These miracles have also been brought about by the tremendous sacrifices of the saints who have often traveled for thousands of miles to enjoy the blessings of the temple. The Lord has honored those sacrifices and now made the temple blessings available to so many with so much less sacrifice. I am reminded of President Monson&rsquo;s words in 2011 April Conference:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some degree of sacrifice has ever been associated with temple building and with temple attendance. Countless are those who have labored and struggled in order to obtain for themselves and for their families the blessings which are found in the temples of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are so many willing to give so much in order to receive the blessings of the temple? Those who understand the eternal blessings, which come from the temple, know that no sacrifice is too great, no price too heavy, no struggle too difficult in order to receive those blessings. There are never too many miles to travel, too many obstacles to overcome, or too much discomfort to endure. They understand that the saving ordinances received in the temple that permit us to someday return to our Heavenly Father in an eternal family relationship and to be endowed with blessings and power from on high are worth every sacrifice and every effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today most of us do not have to suffer great hardships in order to attend the temple. Eighty-five percent of the membership of the Church now live within 200 miles (320 km) of a temple, and for a great many of us, that distance is much shorter. <a href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then he added these words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until you have entered the house of the Lord and have received all the blessings which await you there, you have not obtained everything the Church has to offer. The all-important and crowning blessings of membership in the Church are those blessings which we receive in the temples of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Temple attendance brings great blessings, some blessings for eternity, some for this mortal life. The two types are interconnected. As you go to the temple frequently, your understanding of the eternal blessings becomes more profound, and your appreciation of the mortal life blessings increases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rexburg Idaho Temple</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>I urge you to make the temple a regular part of your life. Too often young people have the vision of getting married in the temple, and lack the vision of making the temple part of their life. Do not make that mistake. Get your own &ldquo;crowning blessings&rdquo; and then make it part of your life to go frequently to make those &ldquo;crowning blessings&rdquo; available to others beyond the veil, and in that process enjoy the &ldquo;mortal life&rdquo; blessings of peace, harmony, focus, spiritual strength, and revelation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, this afternoon, time is given us to use wisely. All time in a real sense belongs to the Creator of heaven and earth and is apportioned to each of us to learn&mdash;learn good from evil and with His help choose to come to Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A few weeks ago, Sister Richardson and I joined with you in a Tuesday devotional. Before President Clark stood, indicating the need for quiet, I asked a student this question: &ldquo;Tell me, Why do you choose to come to Devotionals?&rdquo; That was framed in a positive tone. As you would expect, he said, &ldquo;I like the spirit here.&rdquo; He went on to add, &ldquo;And I like to listen to what they say, and think about it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As time is made available for this and each devotional, you are individually invited to this great place for wise purpose. We meet under the direction of President Kim Clark, called by President Hinckley and now continues under direction of President Monson and the Board of Trustees, the Twelve. In a larger sense, we meet in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a great place, useful for many and for varied purposes, all under the direction of today&rsquo;s servants authorized by Him who created all things. This fine university is the result of faith in Our Lord Jesus Christ. The efforts of many, who planned carefully and built with great physical energy, have resulted in this very useful Brigham Young University&shy;&ndash;Idaho. This place was raised from the soil deep to the very place you are sitting. It was raised from the dust, as it were, for <em>you</em> my younger brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This BYU&ndash;I Center is built where Thomas E. Ricks, and others, farmed by pulling heavy farm equipment with a span of six or eight horses all day&mdash;as long as light lasted. They toiled into the night for two reasons. The first was they either worked or became hungry. The more important reason, over time, is this university with His temple nearby. You&mdash;each of you&mdash;would do well to know how you came to be here, for what reason and for what work&mdash;to be done&mdash;every day. The idle mind like sin and most kinds of entertainment either detract or destroy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Come unto me,&rdquo; the Savior said. &ldquo;All ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;We feel the need to know the meaning, the extended meaning of those powerful but brief words. They have eternal consequence to all who will hear, understand and do. &ldquo;He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#_edn2" target="_self">2</a>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Picture of Peter, Andrew, the Savior calling to them in the fishing boat]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you will, what comes next in the picture? &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; He said to Peter and Andrew as they drew nets ashore. &ldquo;Come and I will make you fishers of men.&rdquo; The text, which is the scripture, indicates they willingly came, leaving their nets. Their nets, left lying in the sand? The very source of their living? We don&rsquo;t know what words were then asked or said later. Perhaps, if these two had any time in their own homes that day, Peter&rsquo;s wife would have been interested, learning there would not be fish provided that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then from Peter, &ldquo;Come and see and hear.&rdquo; From that day until now, from Adam to Peter, to President Joseph Smith, Jr. to President Monson, those words are either shouted from the house tops, or more often intently extended by nineteen, soon to be eighteen year old authorized young men and slightly older sister missionaries. &ldquo;Come and see and hear and do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter and Andrew may have learned a bit more about the law of sacrifice that day. Ten others were called as apostles and taught sacred things, instructed, and authorized by simple ceremony, preparing for the time He, the Savior, would leave. We remember vividly the events leading to His sacrifice by crucifixion. He was falsely accused by those who professed to lead righteously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is written He was forced to carry the cross or a portion thereof up the narrow way to Golgatha, also called Calvary. As He struggled, passing near to the women who knew him well, their distress was evidenced by loud cries. Turning briefly toward them, he called to them, &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming in the which they shall say, blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare and the paps which never gave suck.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp; We surely live in that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then followed the giving of His life&mdash;like no other person who ever lived&mdash;He in whom there was no sin, the Son of the Father&mdash;our Holy Father. Babylon or Hollywood, fail utterly in the attempt to recreate on film those few hours or days. Perhaps credit can be given for effort, however.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of this ye shall bear record,&rdquo; He said to those who wrote faithfully: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. &nbsp;We have the record of those events today. They testify of Christ and his mortal ministry. Read them. Think on them. Act on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been assured that the Lord knows each of us His children. He has offered to receive each of us, by His love to come unto Him. &nbsp;At or near the end of a two-day conference involving many of us earlier this year, President Clark reviewed &ldquo;the love of God&rdquo; from Lehi and more by Nephi in the early chapters of the Book of Mormon. Those who know President Clark at all would not have been surprised by his choice to speak of &ldquo;the love of God,&rdquo; although much or most of the conference had been centered on learning, teaching and such interactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Clark&rsquo;s capacity &ldquo;to bring us with Him&rdquo; as he spoke, led us all the more to desire to understand and receive the love of God. &ldquo;It is the Spirit that giveth life.&rdquo; When we want to know Him, having a &ldquo;thirst to know&rdquo; the Christ, and hence the Father, we will then come to Him. He will receive us. He will receive you indeed. You will be made aware by the function of Holy Spirit. We are led then to become His disciple even His disciple/leaders as we are reminded often here at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of &ldquo;Learning and Latter-day Saints&rdquo;, a few short years ago, Elder Dallin H. Oaks, of the Twelve reviewed this:</p>
<p>As Latter-day Saints we believe in education, and we have a philosophy about how and why we should pursue it. Our religious faith teaches us that we should seek learning by the Spirit and that we have a stewardship to use our knowledge for the benefit of mankind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our quest for truth should be as broad as our life&rsquo;s activities and as deep as our circumstances permit. A learned Latter-day Saint 	should seek to understand the important religious, physical, social and political problems of the day. The more knowledge we 	have of heavenly laws and earthly things, the greater influence we can exert for good on those around us and the safer we will be 	from the scurrilous and evil influences that may confuse and destroy us.<a href="#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of &ldquo;earthly things,&rdquo; our two home teachers are notable to us because they are good. The one is professionally trained in operating on vessels of the heart while it continues its job as a pump&mdash;no heart-lung machine primed with donated blood. Recently before the lesson was presented, this home teacher quoted his esteemed mentor of a few years back making a statement having to do with earthly things, theories, on the care of the human body systems. &ldquo;You should know something,&rdquo; the senior staff surgeon said. &ldquo;Half of all we teach is wrong.&rdquo; There was a pause. With perfect timing our home teacher quoted the senior mentor saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the biggest problem. The truth is we don&rsquo;t know which half is wrong. The rest of our professional life will be dedicated to finding the truth.&rdquo;&mdash;or words to that effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you know there is a risk in my relating that conversation. You may wonder if I mistrust your instructors&mdash;just the opposite. As we hear and read the words of Christ, we believe. His very name is synonymous with &ldquo;grace and truth.&rdquo; From His own words, our Savior promised the Holy Spirit &ldquo;He will guide you into all truth.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;Our need as believers is to receive the Holy Spirit in our efforts to learn. Then we are prepared to extend to others the opportunity to learn all things &ldquo;religious, physical, social and political.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our homes and with our children present and future we will find our greatest opportunity. They depend upon us. They need us to help them find their way along the iron rod to the love of God: A tree most beautiful and precious and the fountain of living waters. Your children will continue to surprise you with their degree of understanding of the quiet function of the Holy Spirit&mdash;well before their baptism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we return to Elder Oaks, quote:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We caution that with the need to finish school and establish financial security, men or women might be tempted to assign 	marriage a low priority. It is eternally shortsighted to pursue a professional course that makes one unavailable for marriage, an 	eternal value, because it does not fit into professional timing, a worldly value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one, however, knows better than a BYU-Idaho student, the challenges that may be involved in an educational goal trying to balance choices and emotions with courtship and marriage. Sister Richardson would probably approve of my confirming that we dated for two years then married in the Idaho Falls Temple soon after we both graduated from BYU Provo. I recall we were able to spend some time together Sunday afternoons. Otherwise I worked part time and she was married to a practice piano and pipe organ. We began graduate school with two welcomed children. It&rsquo;s possible, I found, to hold a book in one hand and a fussy baby in the other while the nursing mother gets some much needed rest. Brethren, young fathers, take note!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, follow me,&rdquo; the Savior said, first to the Twelve. Not only to become fishers of men, but also to receive that authority which can come only from the Father. &ldquo;I am His son,&rdquo; the Savior confirmed. He was the only begotten Son coming directly from the Father without an earthly father. &ldquo;I do only the Father&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; He said. &ldquo; What I receive from the Father, I give to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the text we find His teachings revealing &ldquo;the love of God&rdquo; closely related to His call to come follow Him. &ldquo;If ye love me, keep my commandments.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Greater love hath no man than that he layeth it down for his friends&rdquo;<a href="#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;The first and great commandments define our personal love of God and also for our neighbor&mdash;none is greater. As we grow in our understanding of His love for us we are assured it will never change. That is true although we may show weakness and sin over time. The physical tendencies of the natural man or woman allow Satan&rsquo;s efforts to destroy us. In that, we do not do well. Sin lieth at the door. At that critical point in time, we choose. We recall the power of the love of Him who is the source of all truth, or we volunteer to follow the father of lies. These may be &ldquo;little lies.&rdquo; We may say to ourselves, &ldquo;No one will ever know.&rdquo; &ldquo;Just this once.&rdquo; &ldquo;No one is perfect.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satan laugheth and his angels rejoice.&rdquo; If he can have you, no one may be beyond his power. If true repentance follows, then His atonement satisfies the demands of justice for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feelings between persons, either single or married that admit contention, estrangement, and anger become the seedbed of discouragement and sin. Therefore, again the most powerful invitation you receive may be to &ldquo;Come to me, follow me, do the things you have seen me do&hellip;this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do, that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do, even that shall ye do.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In a sense, that is a very practical statement. You <em>can</em> do it. Past-President Spencer W. Kimball, our previous stake president in Safford, Arizona often said, &ldquo;Do it.&rdquo; &nbsp;A little later he added one word, &ldquo;Do it now!&rdquo; Past-President Gordon B. Hinckley was wont to say, &ldquo;Do the best you can!&rdquo; Later he added one word. &ldquo;Do the very best you can!&rdquo; President Thomas S. Monson, standing in solemn assembly as he was sustained as President and Prophet by the membership of the Church, thirteen million strong encouraged &lsquo;the less active, the offended, the critical, the transgressor,&rsquo; to come back. &ldquo;Come, and be made whole&rdquo; he said with great intensity. He often used the word &ldquo;rescue&rdquo;. That word takes on added meaning remembering the &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; of the members of the Willie and Martin handcart companies. You have not lived well, I say, until and unless you become part of that inspiring, real history of events, written or by electronic record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorrows come to each individual or family, uninvited and very much unappreciated. Sorrow and losses may be weather related events as our nation has just experienced. The decisions and action of others may injure us. More importantly, our own thoughts, words and actions may injure us. There is one more. The feeling of loss and loneliness upon death of a loved one is real. It is as real as the joy of a new baby girl or boy. Other experiences seem to tear at the very core of one&rsquo;s life. Injury or loss of life by accident or in wartime is devastating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question often follows, &ldquo;Why me? Why me now?&rdquo; There may be no adequate answer. Our desires to extend love to another at those times may seem difficult. The hymn, &ldquo;Where Can I Turn for Peace&rdquo;, with the words by Emma Lou Thayne, is expressive of our true feelings. I quote from the hymn: &ldquo;Where can I turn for peace? Where is my solace when other sources cease to make me whole? Where is the quiet hand to calm my anguish? Who can understand? He, only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words bring us to the very point, &ldquo;Come Unto Me.&rdquo; One with deep pain of soul, can feel again, from the hymn, &ldquo;He answers privately, reaches my reaching, in my Gethsemane, Savior and Friend.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As you leave this place today, you may want to talk less and think more. On your way through the doors look carefully at the walls with the beautiful paintings, high ceilings, large windows and hopefully some sunlight. How did this great place come to be? And why was this whole campus built, from day one? <em>For you it was and is.</em> Use this Brigham Young University-Idaho wisely. Use it thoroughly and with gratitude to those whose pioneer work was tireless with sweat and a few tears. And to those who presently lead you and serve so very well, we join you in acknowledgement to them. Without them, beginning with your President, you and we are nowhere. Leave this University in good condition physically and spiritually perhaps even for your children and presently for our grandchildren&mdash;two of whom are students here. My desire is that what has been said here, being true, you will now make it your own, coming to Christ each day and always, I pray in His name. Amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s November, and you are nearing the completion of another semester. I am making the assumption that you are here with a purpose. I hope that one of your goals is to get a good education. However, I realize that individually you may have different objectives in mind. When I was a student at BYU, having been called into a bishopric of a singles ward, I was interviewing a young freshman sister about a possible call. During the course of our interview, I asked her why she was at BYU, thinking about her major. Her response surprised me, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m here to marry a General Authority.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell her that I thought they were all taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe her desire was sincere and certainly worthy. What she didn&rsquo;t realize was that she needed to find a young man compatible in personality and goals, who held the priesthood and who was honorable and faithful, with a strong testimony, and then help him become someone who was qualified to be a General Authority. It is not necessary, however, to be a General Authority to qualify for the blessings and experiences General Authorities have. God would have all men be able to speak in the name of God the Lord.<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know something about what you are and will face. We live in perilous times. It can be unsettling when hoped for outcomes aren&rsquo;t realized and things seem to be falling apart all around us. Peace and safety comes when we are well anchored to the eternal bedrock of the gospel. Our responsibility on earth is to qualify for exaltation by completing our divinely appointed responsibilities. This is an individual work and a responsibility. In the scriptures we read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have 	so much the advantage in the world to come.</p>
<p>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated&mdash;</p>
<p>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.<a href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gaining an education and qualifying for exaltation will be of eternal value to you. Completing your divinely appointed responsibilities will provide you with the needed credentials for exaltation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first job out of college was working for The Boeing Company. Boeing, as you know, makes airplanes. During the course of my employment, I learned that to make airplanes that were safe, Boeing had specifications for every part. The parts had to be qualified as meeting all standards including the shape, size and material and the tolerances. Each part had to be certified as meeting those standards. If a part met the standards, it would be placed in inventory to building an airplane. If it didn&rsquo;t meet the standards, the part would be rejected and returned to the supplier. Suppliers of parts were very careful to understand all of the requirements including the tolerances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you willingly ride in an airplane with substandard parts? Of course not! You would want the parts to exceed the standard. But some people appear to be willing to embrace substandard behavior in their lives. Only by knowing, understanding and living the doctrine of Christ can an individual adopt the behavior needed to qualify him for exaltation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I would like to talk to you about standards and tolerances that affect each of our lives. I think you know what a standard is. Tolerance is a word that is heard frequently in society today, usually it is in the context of being tolerant or accepting of other people&rsquo;s cultures or behavior. Sometimes it is used by people wanting acceptance to do something they want without consideration of its impact on society or others. My purpose is not to talk about that definition, but to focus on the <em>engineering</em> definition of the word tolerance and its application on us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tolerance is used to define acceptable limits from a defined standard. In manufacturing a part, the tolerance might be specified to be five inches long, plus or minus a thousandth of an inch. Another part might be defined to be made of a certain material that was ninety-nine point nine percent pure, like gold bars. As you move forward with your goals of education, marriage, employment, life, and working out your salvations, there are standards with tolerances you must meet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standards for salvation are called commandments given by our Father in Heaven. These standards apply to all parts of our lives and at all times. They are not selectively applied at a certain time or in a certain situation. These define the standard required to qualify for exaltation. There is a judgment, which, in a sense, is like the certification process for a part. Just as there are qualifying tests for aircraft parts, our Father in Heaven has a judgment to determine if we will be certified. It is to our advantage to know and meet the standards within the tolerance the Lord has set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I speak on this subject, I would do so in the context of recent talks given by members of the Quorum of the Twelve. One talk was given by Elder M. Russell Ballard on January 30, 2010 at BYU-Idaho. At that time, he spoke on the subject of signs of the times. After spending time talking about various signs of the times and their fulfillment or the nearness of the fulfillment of those signs, he said, &ldquo;I want to try to pull this together, not to frighten you but to wake you up.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;He then challenged the students to be prepared by having strong testimonies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other talks were given by Elder Dallin H. Oaks in the April and October general conferences of 2004. The title of the April talk was &ldquo;Preparation for the Second Coming&rdquo; and the title of the second was &ldquo;That Ye May Not Be Deceived.&rdquo; In both talks, Elder Oaks related the story of the ten virgins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will remember the ten virgins were invited to the wedding feast. When the Bridegroom arrived, five had the oil and were able to enter. The other five came late and could not enter the feast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After relating the parable Elder Oaks said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The arithmetic of this parable is chilling. The ten virgins obviously represent members of Christ&rsquo;s Church, for all were invited to 	the wedding feast and all knew what was required to be admitted when the bridegroom came. But only half were ready when he 	came.<a href="#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The five virgins met the standards and so must we.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God created us in his own image. The plan for us on this earth is to obtain a body, have experience, receive ordinances and endure to the end. There are standards that have been established and parameters set which we need to live to qualify for exaltation. He has promised that we can be exalted, but He has also said, &ldquo;I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when you do not what I say, ye have no promise.<a href="#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my experience working at Boeing, I learned of the importance of parts meeting the standards to become certified. All of us would be reluctant to ride in an airplane made of parts that did not meet the standards. Before I started working at Boeing, they had built what was then the largest building in the world. It was made to manufacture the 747 aircraft. The building was massive and sat on ninety-eight plus acres and has enough room inside to hold seventy-four football fields or nine hundred eleven basketball courts. It was around a half-mile long and nearly that wide. You could fit fifteen of the big U.S. Navy aircraft carriers inside the building and still have room to spare. The doors to the building are the size of a football field, and there are six of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the specifications for this building required a tolerance of plus or minus one/thirty-second of an inch, and a contractor measured long for each inch of the building&rsquo;s length, the building would be over eighty feet longer than specified. If he measured short for each inch of the length of the building, it would be about eighty feet shorter than the specified length. Either way, there would be a problem. Even if each measurement was just barely within tolerance, the accumulated affect over a long distance can create significant errors. In the specifications for airplane parts, the tolerances are even tighter than for a building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>God&rsquo;s Plan and Standard</strong></p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s plan of salvation, we are the ones who are being molded, shaped and polished to become like Him. It is something each of us has to do individually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For behold, this is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has established what we must do and the standards that we must meet. Something quite remarkable is that He gives us the moral agency of deciding whether or not we choose to accept and meet those standards. However, there are consequences of our decisions. While He gave us agency, He does not give us the authority to change the standards or the consequences of our decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because there are standards and we have agency to choose there is a final judgment, at which time each of us will be reviewed to see if we meet the standards. In other words to see if we have lived within the standards and tolerances He defined. We will either meet or not meet the standards that have been set. His judgment will be final. While there is a doctrine of repentance that allows us to correct or fix defects, it is better to focus on meeting God&rsquo;s standards rather than planning to just invoke the principle of repentance before the judgment. I learned this lesson of meeting standards as a teenager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a teenager I spent my summers working on my grandfather&rsquo;s ranch in Wyoming. It was a sheep and cattle ranch of more than two thousand acres plus additional rangeland. The ranch operation required a lot of equipment. Since the closest repair center was a long way away through part of the Wyoming Bad Lands my grandfather taught us to carefully maintain the equipment and inspect everything before we left the ranch house. If we had a breakdown, it was usually miles from the ranch house and that meant a long walk. It didn&rsquo;t take long for me to learn the law of consequences. It was always better to avoid the problems than have a long walk. The same is true with the commandments of our Heavenly Father. He can tell the difference between someone who is striving to become like Him<a href="#_edn7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;and an individual who is pushing the edges but trying to stay just inside the acceptable limits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Examples of God&rsquo;s Standards</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few examples of God-given standards. One example is the Ten Commandments given to Moses and the Israelites he led out of bondage. The Ten Commandments have become known as the lesser or temporal law. The Lord also taught the standard would be heightened at His coming, which has occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This commandment says we are to <em>become</em> not just do. The Savior said, &ldquo;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;In the Book of Mormon He asked, &ldquo;Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be?&rdquo; Then answering the question He said, &ldquo;Verily I say unto you, even as I am.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next commandment is about tolerances. Christ taught, &ldquo;Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it."<a href="#_edn10" target="_self"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;This illustrates that the standard is set and the tolerances given are narrow, not broad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The name of Christ is the only one name whereby we can qualify for exaltation. He said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man 	can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, 	and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen.<a href="#_edn11" target="_self"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the parable of the ten virgins used by Elder Oaks in his conference talks. This scripture illustrates both the judgment and a requirement to have the Holy Ghost as our guide so that we are not deceived as we move through our life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The Family: A Proclamation to the World&rdquo; is a more recent scripture given by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve. It singles out standards and tolerances on issues prominent in today&rsquo;s society. They include the importance of temple marriage and families, the eternal nature of gender, and the importance of caring for and treating our spouses and children with love and tenderness according to our Father&rsquo;s commandments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will do better by knowing, understanding and acting to meet the standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Opposition</strong></p>
<p>There are those, if they could, in the world today who are striving to dismiss or change the standards established by God. This is not a new phenomenon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!&rdquo;<a href="#_edn12" target="_self"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must not be deceived or give heed to those who would attempt to convince us that the standards have changed. They have no authority to change those standards. Only the designer, Heavenly Father, can change the specifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of us easily recognize how ridiculous it would be for a Boeing supplier to listen to some unrelated individual who promoted making changes to the specifications or tolerances of a part. None of us would want to ride in an airplane manufactured with such a part. Parts that do not meet the Boeing specifications are rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one would accuse Boeing of being unthoughtful or intolerant when such parts are rejected. Boeing would not and could not jeopardize all of the passengers who may fly in their airplanes. They would not allow themselves to be intimidated or bullied into accepting parts that cannot be certified. To do so would jeopardize their business and the lives of their customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same is true with God&rsquo;s laws and commandments. His standards are fixed, and no one else can change them. Some individuals who think they can, will be greatly surprised in the final judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>God is the Designer</strong></p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father is the designer of the plan of salvation. He has put in place all that is needed for us to qualify to return to His presence. The standards are set and are known and are easily available to each of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has told us that all of us are capable of meeting the standards. This scripture is evidence of this. From the Word of Wisdom we read, &ldquo;Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn13" target="_self"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will not be tested beyond our capacity. The Savior teaches an individual &ldquo;may not be tempted above that which he is able to bear.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn14" target="_self"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have the power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the power is in [you], wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn15" target="_self"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can know and have the capacity to qualify for exaltation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to live the Standards</strong></p>
<p>We find the standards by attending church and studying and acting on the doctrines in the scriptures and in the words of our modern prophets contained in Church publications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The greatest source of guidance is the promptings that come from the Holy Ghost who will teach us all things that we must know.<a href="#_edn16" target="_self"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;With the Spirit, we can know right and wrong. He will guide us and help us throughout our lives. We can feel in our hearts and have thoughts come into our minds that can give comfort and guidance. This is true even for children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn17" target="_self"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God has promised that He will help us as we meet His standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one would willingly ride in an airplane with substandard parts. Nor should you accept or practice substandard behavior. Only by knowing, understanding and living the doctrine of Christ can an individual qualify for exaltation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is a great privilege to be with you. Even though I don&rsquo;t know most of you I know enough about you to love you and care about you. My message is for this entire congregation, including online students and instructors in various locations throughout the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to invite a king of the Lamanites to introduce our topic today. This is King Lamoni&rsquo;s father. When we first meet him he is not a nice man. First he tries to kill his own son. Then he tries to kill the missionary Ammon. Ammon withstands the attacks and compels the king to release his fellow missionaries from prison. The king was impressed, even astonished, by the love Ammon had for Lamoni. He was so impressed he wanted to learn more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we skip forward in the story, Ammon&rsquo;s brother Aaron is teaching the king.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Aaron answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God? And the king said&hellip;if now thou sayest there is a 	God, behold I will believe.<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup><sup>1</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would believe his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading the 	scriptures unto the king&mdash;how God created man after his own image...<a href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup><sup>2</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aaron goes on to explain the fall of man, and the plan of redemption through Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it came to pass that after Aaron had expounded these things unto him, the king said: What shall I do that I may have this 	eternal life of which thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I do that I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my 	breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day? Behold, said he, I will give up 	all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.<a href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup><sup>3</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have entitled my remarks &ldquo;Love is Spoken Here.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn4" target="_self"><sup><sup>4</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;We, like the king of the Lamanites, can receive this great joy because of the love of God. Three principles will guide our time together:</p>
<p>1. &ldquo;God is love,&rdquo;<a href="#_edn5" target="_self"><sup><sup>5</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;and we are the children of God.</p>
<p>2. The love of God comes as a &ldquo;gift from &hellip; above&rdquo;<a href="#_edn6" target="_self"><sup><sup>6</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;as we seek it.</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;Go ye therefore and teach all nations&rdquo;<a href="#_edn7" target="_self"><sup><sup>7</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;by sharing His love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First: &ldquo;God is love,&rdquo; and we are the children of God</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The phrase &ldquo;God is love&rdquo;<a href="#_edn8" target="_self"><sup><sup>8</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;comes from 1 John in the New Testament. I have been both puzzled and inspired by this phrase. It does not say God is filled with love, although that is true. It does not say that God acts in love, although that is also true. It says God is love. The word &ldquo;is&rdquo; suggests equivalence. Love is what God is. Love is what He has become.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf invited us to &ldquo;think of the purest, most all-consuming love you can imagine. Now multiply that love by an infinite amount&mdash;that is the measure of God&rsquo;s love for you. &hellip; He loves us because He is filled with an infinite measure of holy, pure, and indescribable love.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn9" target="_self"><sup><sup>9</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know God is love. We may not fully comprehend His love, but we know it is real. Let&rsquo;s extend the equation. We know that we are children of God. &ldquo;And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn10" target="_self"><sup><sup>10</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf continues: &ldquo;We are important to God not because of our resume but because we are His children. He loves every one of us, even those who are flawed, rejected, awkward, sorrowful, or broken. God&rsquo;s love is so great that He loves even the proud, the selfish, the arrogant, and the wicked.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn11" target="_self"><sup><sup>11</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are love. I am love. In embryo, yes&mdash;we are not yet as God is. As children of God our nature is pure love. Because we are children we are in the process of growing up in the Lord. We are growing up to have a fullness of His love. We grow up by knowing and doing the will of Heavenly Father. We grow up as the Atonement of Jesus Christ increases our capacity and reveals our true nature shining through our fallen nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are too many examples of the children of God running away from, hiding from, or otherwise masking their true nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 3 Nephi: &ldquo;they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn12" target="_self"><sup><sup>12</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Doctrine and Covenants: &ldquo;the love of men shall wax cold&rdquo;<a href="#_edn13" target="_self"><sup><sup>13</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;and &ldquo;men&rsquo;s hearts shall fail them.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn14" target="_self"><sup><sup>14</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;From the Pearl of Great Price: &ldquo;because iniquity shall abound, the love of men shall wax cold.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn15" target="_self"><sup><sup>15</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to remind us that we live in a world of increasing darkness. That darkness may even look appealing to the natural man in us. In this darkness there is no foundation, no light, and no joy. We want to remind each other, as often as necessary, that we are not slaves to that darkness, to that coldness, to that blindness. In fact, quite the opposite. We have been given the light we need to overcome the darkness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome [the world] because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.&rdquo;<sup><sup><a href="#_edn16" target="_self">16</a>&nbsp;</sup></sup>With Christ we overcome the world, and we thrive in this mortal probation with great joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lehi&rsquo;s dream the tree of life seems to be a central symbol. Nephi interprets: &ldquo;I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn17" target="_self"><sup><sup>17</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;&ldquo;And the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding of all beauty.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn18" target="_self"><sup><sup>18</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn19" target="_self"><sup><sup>19</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to go with my family to general conference in Salt Lake City. While there I noticed the actions of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve. From this, and other settings, I have observed that these disciples of Jesus Christ have a common characteristic while being unique individuals. It is genuine love. Every interaction exudes the love of God and love for his children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught that &ldquo;love is the most powerful force in the world.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn20" target="_self"><sup><sup>20</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;I testify that God is love. We have inherited the capacity to have that same love. I have seen God&rsquo;s love in the faces and actions of His children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principle two: The love of God comes as a &ldquo;gift from &hellip; above&rdquo; as we seek it.</strong></p>
<p>I quote from a hymn: &ldquo;Were the whole realm of nature mine, that were a present far too small; love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn21" target="_self"><sup><sup>21</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A disciple living in Jesus&rsquo; day, sought out the Savior of the world with a very specific request: &ldquo;Lord, teach us to pray.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn22" target="_self"><sup><sup>22</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;Jesus did teach them to pray. As part of his teaching he gave this direction: &ldquo;Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn23" target="_self"><sup><sup>23</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compare this invitation from Jesus to another invitation from His prophet Mormon: &ldquo;Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn24" target="_self"><sup><sup>24</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The general invitation is to ask, seek, and knock and the way will be opened. The specific invitation is to seek to be filled with the love of God. God is anxious to give us this gift, and to give as much as we can possibly handle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such an invitation and promised blessing from heaven calls out for action on our part, even all of our energy. I share an example of how we might seek and receive such a remarkable gift from the Lord. I&rsquo;ll call it the parable of the homework. This parable is based on a true story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes our children will come to me and ask for help with their homework. Because I love them I feel grateful that they would ask. I set aside whatever I was working on to provide the help they need. Sometimes I find that they want me to do all of the homework problems or activities for them. Other times they lose interest in their homework. They wander off to do something else, even though I am sitting right there next to them to help. In each case they don&rsquo;t get much help with their homework. They want what I can give them, but they haven&rsquo;t learned how to ask for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What kind of asking or seeking allows us to receive the gift of love and charity from Heavenly Father? Let&rsquo;s go back to the homework example to learn more. This part of the parable, incidentally, is aspirational and not yet fully realized at our house. Suppose my daughter came and said, &ldquo;Dad, will you help me with the subtraction part of my homework? I&rsquo;ve practiced a lot of addition and it seems to be working. I&rsquo;ve tried the subtraction but I don&rsquo;t get it. Will you help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set aside whatever I was working on and I go to help. The first thing she says is, &ldquo;Look at these problems that I have been working on. Let me show you how it works.&rdquo; It so happens that I already know how it works, but I am delighted to see her explain it, and it shows me how to help. Then she says, &ldquo;when I get to the subtraction problems, the pattern that was working before doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. Will you help me figure out the new pattern so I will be able to solve the subtraction problems too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can we learn about obtaining a gift from God, including the gift of charity or love, from the two parts of this parable? Here are some possible answers: First, when the request for help came she was already doing her best to apply what she already knew. Second, she asked for help, or a gift, from a source that was capable of providing what she needed. Third, her request was specific. Fourth, she asked with full intention to apply the new knowledge or gift in a specific way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asking and applying are not onetime events but rather a pattern we follow over and over. The Lord can fill us with His love to the degree we seek to be filled. The way we treat the gifts He has given us determines our ability to receive more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and 	there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; 	for unto him that receiveth I will give more.<a href="#_edn25" target="_self"><sup><sup>25</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth 	brighter and brighter until the perfect day.<a href="#_edn26" target="_self"><sup><sup>26</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we follow this pattern we are changed over time. We increasingly become as He is, and love as He loves. Here is an example of an individual who followed this pattern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi had spiritually tasted of the fruit of the tree. He had experienced a measure of the love of God. He seemed to be living according to what he knew to be true. Nephi said: &ldquo;Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn27" target="_self"><sup><sup>27</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also see in Nephi the reality of mortality. In 2 Nephi 4, Nephi laments his mortal weakness and the temptations of the flesh. I can relate very well to Nephi&rsquo;s experience in this chapter. I have felt the love of God. A portion of it has taken root in my soul. I have &ldquo;felt to sing the song of redeeming love.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn28" target="_self"><sup><sup>28</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;Even so, mortality is very hard, and some days I wonder, &ldquo;can ye feel so now?&rdquo;<a href="#_edn29" target="_self"><sup><sup>29</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;Nephi is humble and recognizes his weakness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart 	exclaimeth: O<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng" target="_self"> wretched</a> man that I am! Yea, my heart<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng" target="_self"> sorroweth</a> because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities. 	I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng" target="_self"> beset</a> me. And when I desire to rejoice, my 	heart groaneth because of my sins.<a href="#_edn30" target="_self"><sup><sup>30</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nephi was able to put into words how I feel some days. This is the natural man, the fallen man, trying to take center stage. The natural man can be pretty persistent. But this is not who we are at the core, it is only part of our experience in mortality. If we were left to our own devices these difficult mortal experiences would destroy us. As we receive God&rsquo;s power, including God&rsquo;s love, these mortal experiences refine us and prepare us for exaltation. Nephi, recognizing he could not stand alone, bowed in humility and a desire to receive God&rsquo;s love and strength. He sought the God of love with confidence that God would provide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know in whom I have<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng" target="_self"> trusted. </a>My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in&nbsp;the wilderness.&rdquo; Then, notice how this power from God comes to Nephi. &ldquo;He hath filled me with his<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng" target="_self"> love,</a> even unto the consuming of my flesh.<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng" target="_self">&rdquo;</a><a href="#_edn31" target="_self"><sup><sup>31</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have, on occasion, received gifts of love like the gift Nephi received. I will share one experience from my time as a college student. I was starting a new program at a new University. I didn&rsquo;t know anyone. The program was hard. It took me too many hours of very hard work to even glimpse success. I remember one particular afternoon. The despair from failure and difficulty and loneliness was crushing me. The natural man was getting the upper hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My roommates were away and I knelt in my room and prayed. I prayed deeply because what I was doing was clearly not working. I also prayed for some sort of immediate relief because I felt so low. While I was praying the phone rang. We had no caller ID. Containing my emotion, I answered the phone. On the other end, I heard my angel mother say, &ldquo;Alan, I was just thinking about you. How are you doing?&rdquo; Somehow, God let her know my need and she responded in an instant. Her God-given, unconditional love swept over the miles and filled my heart with peace and confidence. Through her, Heavenly Father&rsquo;s love consumed the natural man I was battling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might happen through a family member, a friend, a stranger, or directly from God through the Holy Ghost. It might be immediate, or it might take some time. In Nephi&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. ...Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn32" target="_self"><sup><sup>32</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heavenly Father and His servants, bless us every day, sometimes in ways that we don&rsquo;t see immediately. He desires to fill us with His love to allow us the joy He has. This is reflected in the rest of the invitation from Mormon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he 	hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall 	appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is 	pure.<a href="#_edn33" target="_self"><sup><sup>33</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The third principle: &ldquo;go ye therefore and teach all nations&rdquo; by sharing His love.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prophets tell us that true love &lsquo;beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.&rsquo;<a href="#_edn34" target="_self"><sup><sup>34</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;So Christ loved 	us, and that is how he hoped we would love each other. In a final injunction to all his disciples for all time he said, &lsquo;a new 	commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you.&rsquo;<a href="#_edn35" target="_self"><sup><sup>35</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;...How should I love thee? As He does. For that 	way never faileth.<a href="#_edn36" target="_self"><sup><sup>36</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our mortal experience is not designed for us to be alone. God is love and He loves individuals. We cannot love unless we have someone to love. Each one of us has a mother and a father, grandparents, and vast ancestry to love and be loved by. Each one of has or will one day have children, grandchildren, and vast posterity to love and be loved by. In the church, we refer to each other as brother and sister&mdash;whether in the Church or out, we are surrounded every day by Heavenly Father&rsquo;s children to love and to be loved by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In these relationships we might be connected to individuals who have found their way. They are filled with the love of God, they are growing in that love, and they share that love with us and with many others. I know some of these disciples. These Christlike individuals are on the difficult, rigorous path of discipleship and they need our care. There are also many of our brothers and sisters whose God-given inclination to love and to be loved has been masked, hidden, or unrealized. Some of these individuals are just waiting to have that seed of the love of God awaken inside of them. Some don&rsquo;t even realize they are waiting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prophet Joseph taught, and lived: &ldquo;Love is one of the chief characteristics of Deity, and ought to be manifested by those who aspire to be the sons of God. A man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn37" target="_self"><sup><sup>37</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BYU&ndash;Idaho is an institution where we get to rub shoulders with individuals from around the whole world every day. We get to share our love and help God&rsquo;s children every day. One principle of the BYU&ndash;Idaho Learning Model is: &ldquo;Learners and teachers at BYU&ndash;Idaho love, serve, and teach one another.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn38" target="_self"><sup><sup>38</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;Teaching one another is one of the specific ways we can love and serve each other. There are many others. Love-motivated service is what we do to progress towards heaven and the perfect nature of God while we are here on earth. In remarks at this school, President Gordon B. Hinckley said: &ldquo;We are trying an experiment here. We think this school is different from any other university in America. I submit that this campus, with its adjoining buildings, may literally offer a foretaste of heaven.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn39" target="_self"><sup><sup>39</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was walking across campus recently and saw three people out ahead of me visiting with each other. As I got closer, they turned to go their separate ways. One of the students turned and called out, &ldquo;I will see you later. I love you!&rdquo; It was a very simple gesture, but one that appeared to lift and give confidence and strength to the other two. This incident is a sample of a piece of heaven on earth. Incidentally, the particular words we use or the particular actions we share are less important than the feeling that is in our heart when we reach out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Learning Model states: &ldquo;When learners and teachers view one another charitably they create safe learning environments where all can stretch and stumble without fear.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn40" target="_self"><sup><sup>40</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;President Henry B. Eyring taught us: &ldquo;It is too easy to think we can climb alone and that we move up on our own power...The climbs to the places God would have us go are never for us alone. If we forget that, we will not have His full power to lift us.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn41" target="_self"><sup><sup>41</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This clip shows a sample of how this is happening at BYU&ndash;Idaho. Because my work here is with online learning, I chose clips from that context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were willing to help each other and work with one another so that we can all be successful and you really feel the love that 	everybody has for one another. We can share our struggles and our accomplishments and get encouragement from each other. 	It&rsquo;s inspiring and encouraging to have the professors that we have. They&rsquo;ve been a great help. They go above and beyond to 	help us learn and to be able to progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they take time for us. I can call them anytime, and I do. Whenever I want something or need something or information I&rsquo;ll just 	pick up the phone and they get back to me as soon as they can. It&rsquo;s great because every week they&rsquo;ll get on and leave a note and 	they&rsquo;ll talk about what to expect in the coming week and it&rsquo;s really neat. One of my instructors was really great at this but just bore 	his testimony in every note that he sent to us and just really encouraged us. And when I felt like it was difficult or I couldn&rsquo;t do it he 	was just very encouraging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have discovered that those here in Rexburg creating online courses, and those scattered throughout the country teaching BYU&ndash;Idaho online courses, have something in common. They have a deep love for God and for His children. They have a deep love for you. Despite barriers of distance and time, they are adept at sharing their love. Here is one example, of many I could cite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debbie Foster is an online instructor living in South Jordan, Utah. She says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many [students] reveal much more about themselves than they would in an &lsquo;in class&rsquo; environment.&nbsp; It helps me remember they 	have likes and little quirks and are excited about the big events in their lives (missions, marriages, little children) and have goals 	and weaknesses. I love that they are trusting enough to share this with us and helps me give feedback that may be more 	personal and directed to what the individual students need to hear&mdash;whether reminders to what they promised themselves to do 	or an understanding that a student is juggling work, school, church and a new baby and trying to do it all. ...Having the extra bit of 	understanding and insight into their lives, helps me love them and want to serve them in the capacity I am able.<a href="#_edn42" target="_self"><sup><sup>42</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will share one more example of BYU&shy;&ndash;Idaho students, filled with the love of God, reaching out to love and serve those around them, even to &ldquo;teach all nations&rdquo; and share that love. This semester there are many BYU&shy;&ndash;Idaho students whose native language is not English and who are not on this campus. They are BYU&ndash;Idaho Pathway students in Mexico and Africa and North and South America. Next semester there will be even more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their first-year curriculum centers on learning how to read, write, and speak English. Those of you who have learned an additional language know that speaking with a native significantly accelerates language learning. The students use common video conferencing tools, like Skype, to talk with a volunteer native English speaker a couple of times a week. Most of these volunteer speaking partners are BYU&ndash;Idaho students, although it could be any Church member who speaks English natively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is just one of many examples of little acts of love combining to make a big difference. President Thomas S. Monson taught:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An attitude of love characterized the mission of the Master. He gave sight to the blind, legs to the lame, and life to the dead. 	Perhaps when we make face-to-face contact with our Maker, we will not be asked, &ldquo;How many positions did you hold?&rdquo; but rather, 	How many people did you help?&rsquo; In reality, you can never love the Lord until you serve Him by serving His people.<a href="#_edn43" target="_self"><sup><sup>43</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our opportunities to share God&rsquo;s love start with our children, or future children. They extend to our parents, grandparents, and those of our posterity we seek to know and save through family history and temple work. They extend to all of our brothers and sisters here at BYU&ndash;Idaho, in our hometowns, or in our future towns, and throughout the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The king of the Lamanites had cried out from his heart &ldquo;I will give up all that I possess &hellip; that I may receive this great joy.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn44" target="_self"><sup><sup>44</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;The love of God is central to this joy. In describing the tree of life, or the love of God, Lehi said, &ldquo;...As I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn45" target="_self"><sup><sup>45</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I close with this hymn text written by Albert F. Bayly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we worship, grant us vision, till Thy love's revealing light, in its height and depth and greatness dawns upon our quickened 	sight, making known the needs and burdens Thy compassion bids us bear, stirring us to tireless striving, thine abundant life to 	share. Called from worship unto service, forth in Thy dear name we go. To the child, the youth, the aged, love in living deeds to 	show. Hope and health, goodwill and comfort, counsel, aid and peace we give. That thy children, Lord, in freedom may Thy 	mercy know, and live!<a href="#_edn46" target="_self"><sup><sup>46</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I testify that God is love, and we are his children. The love of God comes as a gift from heaven as we seek it. We bless and teach all nations by sharing His love. This is our remarkable opportunity, even our divine purpose. At this Thanksgiving time, I am thankful that &ldquo;love is spoken here.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn47" target="_self"><sup><sup>47</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever felt you were standing still or merely observing on the sidelines?&nbsp; Have you felt as if life&rsquo;s opportunities were not within your grasp? The Prophet Thomas S. Monson opened the way for the youth of The Church to press forward living a higher standard of preparation to move the Lord&rsquo;s work ahead. The new pace will require each of us to be prepared in all phases of our lives. This pace we have not been acquainted with before. We must move forward accepting the challenges placed before us.&nbsp; We need to be prepared and we need to have the courage to listen to the spirit and order our lives accordingly. President Howard W. Hunter gave this council in 1978 and I quote: &ldquo;Be prepared. There are opportunities ahead. You don&rsquo;t want to miss them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abraham Lincoln</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>After sitting on the sidelines for a long time losing election after election and struggling to make a professional contribution to his county, Abraham Lincoln simply said, &ldquo;I will prepare, and perhaps my chance will come.&rdquo; He lived long enough to learn that opportunity always favors the prepared life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;We can and perhaps and should look at the defeats Lincoln experienced. Each defeat was a trial and a testing time to help him decide who he was and what he wanted to accomplish in his life. Our lives are really no different. We don&rsquo;t like trials nor do we often have the courage to ask Heavenly Father for trials. The hard times we have throughout our mortal experience will make us who we really are. They will make us think differently and search for answers to solve our problems. In the end, however, we will find that we are different and that we will not give away what we have been taught by our trials. These experiences refine our character and prepare us to take the next steps in our lives.</p>

<p><strong>Sandra Day O&rsquo;Conner</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>After her graduation from Stanford Law School in1952, Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor was among the top students in her class. She applied to every firm that had a notice on Stanford&rsquo;s placement bulletin board; no one would give her an interview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had an undergraduate friend whose father worked in a prestigious firm in L.A. &nbsp;Interviewing with him, he told her that her resume was impressive but they had never hired a woman lawyer and wasn&rsquo;t sure they would. And he was sure that their clients wouldn&rsquo;t stand for it. He then said, &ldquo;If you can type well enough, I might be able to get you on as a legal secretary.&rdquo; She told him that was not the kind of work she was trying to find.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon hearing that the county attorney in San Mateo who had a woman lawyer on his staff, she wrote him. &nbsp;His reply, &ldquo;I have hired everyone I&rsquo;m authorized to hire and I&rsquo;m not funded for another one, so I just don&rsquo;t have a slot for you,&rdquo; and in addition he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have an empty office.&rdquo; Her reply to him was &ldquo;Well, I really would like very much to work in your office; I&rsquo;ll work for nothing until such time in the future as you get a little money and pay me something.&rdquo; That is how Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor began her career and journey to become the first woman justice on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. The year was 1981; the president was Ronald Reagan.<a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Own Endowment Brothers and Sisters</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>An opportunity that we enjoy as part of our assignment as temple president and matron is to visit with those brothers and sisters who are coming to the temple for the first time to receive their endowment. While serving in a previous temple presidency we asked what one small bit of advice would be appropriate to share with these young brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were given these few words and perhaps many of you have already heard them:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you work your mission easy,</p>
<p>It will be hard.</p>
<p>If you work your mission hard</p>
<p>It will be easy.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters these words are easy to remember and they are very simple. However, they present an opportunity for success and growth in every area of our lives. These few words about easy and hard make all the difference.&nbsp; I have come to the conclusion that this advice can apply to anyone, at any time, and in whatever area your experiences take you.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clair&rsquo;s Personal Experience</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Let me share with you a personal experience on preparation. I grew up on a farm just south and a little west of Rexburg in the Lewisville area. My Father farmed and raised hay, grain, and potatoes. Oh, and yes we six boys, as we became old enough, milked several cows.&nbsp; My Dad&rsquo;s philosophy was I don&rsquo;t milk cows to get rich; I milk cows to raise boys. I really didn&rsquo;t like the farm work or milking the cows. It was a trial to me as was the farm work, but I did my share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day I spoke to my father about finding a different job than the work on the farm. He promised to talk with one of the bishops in our Stake about my desire. The following day he told me to stop by the tire store in Rigby.&nbsp; The tire store was only a few blocks from the school. I anxiously awaited the time to visit the store and check on this new opportunity to work. Mr. Pieper greeted me and after a short visit told me I could report to work the next afternoon. I was thrilled as I anticipated a salary and no more farm work. However, I soon found out that I had not understood the fine print in my Dad&rsquo;s plan. There was still work on the farm to be accomplished, and the cows were still part of my responsibility. Many times after work at the tire store I would walk the three miles home and help my brothers with the milking.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I loved the work at the store; and following my mission, I was released by my Stake President, President Pieper. We visited about plans to return to school, and I must say I really didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted to do with my life as far as a vocation. He encouraged me to return to work, while I made my decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day President Pieper took me aside to visit about a change in my employment. Mr. Newton, the owner of the Rexburg tire store, was in desperate need of help. His employee had broken his leg on the job and he was not able to conduct business as usual.&nbsp; President Pieper asked, &ldquo;If I would be willing to help out in Rexburg for the next few months.&rdquo; He also said, &ldquo;I will continue to pay your wage until Mr. Newton is back on his feet. Then he asked, &ldquo;How soon can you be ready to leave for Rexburg and do you have your lunch?&rdquo; Then President Pieper said with a twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;You never know when opportunity may knock, and you need to be prepared to open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These experiences working for my Father, President Pieper, and Paul Newton prepared me for a comfortable place to make my livelihood.&nbsp; I truly like people and enjoyed serving people and helping them to be safe and comfortable as they traveled the highways of this great nation.&nbsp; We never know when opportunity may knock and we need to be prepared to open the door.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>President Kimball</strong></p>
<p>Now a personal reference to President Kimball: It concerns his readiness and his faithful preparation. At President Lee&rsquo;s funeral with love and emotion he declared:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Lee has gone. I never thought it could happen. I sincerely wanted it never to happen. I doubt if anyone in the Church 	has prayed harder and more consistently for a long life and the general welfare for President Lee than my Camilla and me. I am 	four years older than Brother Lee (to the exact day, March 28). I have expected that I would go long before he would go. My heart 	cries out to him and for him. How we loved him!<a href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;President Kimball never aspired to be the Prophet.&nbsp; Elder Kimball, however, when the call came, unexpectedly too be the Prophet, he was prepared.&nbsp; President Kimball was always prepared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important as the youth of this Church that you prepare, believe in what you are doing, have faith, and be ready.&nbsp; Be watchful and don&rsquo;t do or say anything that will limit you opportunity or render you ineffective to serve in the Kingdom of God. Your opportunity to serve will come. Be prepared when it comes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oliver Cowdery</strong></p>
<p>Two days after Oliver Cowdery, an educated schoolteacher, arrived at Joseph&rsquo;s home, the translation of the Book of Mormon resumed. He had mastered the art of penmanship and could write rapidly becoming a great asset to the work. Oliver wrote as Joseph dictated and the work was written on foolscap paper. &nbsp;However Oliver had a desire to translate. He spoke with the Lord in prayer about translation. A revelation given to the Prophet Joseph concerning Oliver&rsquo;s question revealed secrets which until now had been known to Oliver alone. Oliver could no longer doubt that his newfound friend was a prophet of God.<a href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;The Lord then spoke to Joseph telling Joseph why Oliver could not translate.<a href="#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oliver was prepared to be a scribe. Oliver is promised that he will have the power of translation bestowed upon him for it says: &ldquo;And behold, I grant unto you a gift.&rdquo; &nbsp;This wonderful promise might have been fulfilled had Oliver remained within the Church. The sections given for Oliver&rsquo;s benefit and strength have also been responsible for teaching great truths to the members of the Church. There were two copies of the manuscript both written almost entirely by Oliver, one as dictated by Joseph and the other a copy to safeguard against loss while in the hands of the printer.<a href="#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now to you young people who attend Brigham Young University&shy;&ndash;Idaho.&nbsp; The Brethren have worked hard to provide a faculty and staff that share their example of Christ like attributes. The buildings where you attend your classes have been designed to help you learn.&nbsp; Every needful thing has been provided that you may grow, develop, learn, and progress on your mortal journey homeward to live with God and His Son, our Savior, Jesus the Christ. &nbsp;Continue your preparation and be ready for your opportunities. We love you. Many of you are faithful servants of the Lord, as you serve in His holy house. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way of saying be prepared is keep your gospel shoes on.&nbsp; Paul writing to the Ephesians said, &ldquo;Stand therefore, having &hellip; your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;In Acts 12:7-8 the angel said to Simon Peter: &ldquo;Arise&hellip;Bind on thy sandals&hellip;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Jesus came to the Americas to visit the Nephites after His resurrection. He spent the day teaching them the beautiful truths of the Gospel, but was able to perceive that they were weak and unable to understand all of the words that He was commanded by the Father to speak to them.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nephites</strong></p>
<p>In 3 Nephi 17:3 Jesus told the Nephites: &ldquo;Therefore go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name that ye may understand, and prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This scripture, which aided the Nephites in understanding the Gospel, will help each of us in this BYU&ndash;I Center as we consider our first or hundredth time attending the temple. The five steps he gave in being prepared are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Go ye unto your homes</strong></p>
<p>In our homes we should be able to find a place of prayer, peace understanding, learning, and love.&nbsp; There should be nothing in our homes that limits our opportunity to be taught by the Spirit. Nothing that could or would prevent us from being taught and feeling the Spirit should be present in our homes. The Lord has power beyond our comprehension that can make differences in our lives.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Ponder upon the things which I have said</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ponder could include such works as reflecting, studying, and meditation. We must be acquainted with the temple ordinances to ponder effectively. Our scriptures can be read and reread as we ponder on a particular topic or verse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The temple ordinances must be written in our hearts and minds. We are unable to read the words from a printed page. Perhaps sometime you have wished that the session could be paused while you reflected or wrote a note to remind you of something you learned. We must learn to remember what we have been taught by the Spirit. Then in a quiet moment, either in or out of the temple, ponder on what you have learned.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Ask the Father, in my name that ye may understand</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Prayer is always a way to gain understanding. How often do we get on our knees prior to attending the temple? Upon our return home do we kneel to pray and beseech him to teach us the truths of His Holy House? &nbsp;He is ever willing; all we must do is ask. When we give instruction, we always tell those receiving their own endowment that they will have questions. Those questions can be asked of their loved ones while they are in the temple and as they greet one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we visit together outside the temple with family, we can know that this can be appropriate as long as we only use and speak of those thing found in the scriptures or written in the official publications of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Outside the temple great care must be taken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the October 1997 General Conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley said, and I quote: &ldquo;We are under obligation serious and binding to not use temple language outside the temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we live within the parameters the Lord has given we will be safe and will be helping to keep the temple sacred. &ldquo;Remember that that which cometh from above is sacred, and must be spoken with care and by constraint of the spirit; and in this there is no condemnation.&rdquo; <sup><a href="#_edn7" target="_self">7</a></sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Prepare your minds for the morrow</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The temple is the House of the Lord. It is beautiful, peaceful, and filled with the spirit of our Lord and Savior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should be mature and seek to avoid anything that brings offense to the Spirit. Those offenses can range all the way from language, the type of entertainment we participate in whether it be movies or music. &nbsp;Occasionally even our dress and hairstyles, if extreme, can be offensive. Elder Boyd K. Packer said, &ldquo;The Lord could not be pleased with those who show obvious preference to follow after the ways of the world.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn8" target="_self"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serving our ancestors can help us put our minds in the proper frame to receive revelation and we are more receptive to spiritual things. We can be blessed with a deeper commitment to the ordinances because we are doing the work for our own.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. I come unto you again</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Nephites were told that the Savior would come again.&nbsp; The Holy Temple is where He will come. Each time we return we can feel His Spirit, feel the calm and peace that abound there and be taught by revelation those matters we have talked with Him about in our prayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must determine that we will return as often as possible. You students and many in the community are so blessed to have this temple in such close proximity.&nbsp; Often when we live so close it becomes more difficult to attend because we know it is so close and we can be there in a few minutes. When we travel distances we have to plan.&nbsp; When we live close we also have to plan.&nbsp; We need to pick a day of the week, a time of day, or a particular session.&nbsp; Make this your temple time.&nbsp; Guard it carefully. And make sure your temple recommend is in the same place in your wallet.&nbsp; We have not time for distractions and looking for a recommend can interfere with your ability to be in the temple when you are prompted. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Christmas gift</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As a Christmas gift one of the children received an electric rock-polishing machine. They were all anxious to see how it worked and what would happen to the ordinary Madison County rocks.&nbsp; Mind you, there were no precious stones just ordinary rocks that filled the can. I don&rsquo;t remember the complete process but after a number of hours of tumbling we anxiously opened the can to find that each rock had received a complete makeover. Those plain unattractive rocks now had a smooth surface, a deep polished appearance, and the natural coloring and accent stripes&nbsp;shone brightly. Those simple, plain, unattractive rocks had a beauty that I would not have thought possible. This same process happens to us as we experience the polishing that God sees fit as a preparation for our growth and development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mortality&rsquo;s trials and disappointments have polished us. Our Church preparations began early in Primary, Young Women&rsquo;s, Young Men&rsquo;s and for you brethren the Aaronic Priesthood. You received gospel teachings and instructions, helping you prepare to be who you really can become.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the present time, many of you are finishing your final preparations to be in the temple for your endowment and sealing. Others are making plans for missions; where you will baptize new converts and instill a desire in them to receive temple blessings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the temple becomes an important part of your life&rsquo;s experiences you will continue this gentle polishing. The opportunity to be taught, to learn, feel the spirit of the Lord in His Holy House, receive revelation for you and your loved ones, and find that peace, &ldquo;that passes all understanding.&rdquo; &nbsp;You will desire to have that continued gentle polishing needed to finish your final preparation to go back to the presence of God and there live with Him for the eternities. He has promised us in the scriptures &ldquo;all that He has we will be able to obtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jessica</strong></p>
<p>May all of your preparation be centered on being in the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nineteen years ago in September our family was changed forever. Our beautiful granddaughter, Jessica, was called back home quickly and unexpectedly. We all loved her and she has been a great continuing influence in our lives, to live the gospel and be with her and our Heavenly Father. Just a few minutes before Jessica, her older brother Jaren and I returned home. Her last words were, &ldquo;Grandpa, Can I sing to you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then in her tender sweet way she sang as only a sweet little three-year-old can. Not all of the words, but I have always felt she directed our family to the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love to see the temple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going there someday</p>
<p>To feel the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p>To listen and to pray.</p>
<p>For the temple is a house of God,</p>
<p>A place of love and beauty,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll prepare myself while I am young;</p>
<p>This is my sacred duty,</p>
<p>I love to see the temple,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll covenant with my Father;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll promise to obey.</p>
<p>For the temple is a holy place</p>
<p>Where we are sealed together,</p>
<p>As a child of God, I&rsquo;ve learned this truth:</p>
<p>A family is forever.<a href="#_edn9" target="_self"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The gist of the principle of the wood chop is: When splitting a piece of wood with an ax, a person needs to focus completely on the job at hand and concentrate great effort to get the job done. I believe the Lord has tried to teach His children this principle on many occasions because He loves us and He knows that making progress brings us joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proverbs 10:4 says, &ldquo;He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the<strong> </strong>diligent maketh rich.&rdquo; A diligent hand &ldquo;maketh rich&rdquo;; gets things done so that progress is made. A &ldquo;slack hand&rdquo; or half-hearted effort causes lack of progress, or to become poor. Just putting in time isn&rsquo;t the same as focusing on getting the job done. If you noticed, I was using a machete on that piece of wood, which would take forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just putting in time isn&rsquo;t the same as focusing on getting the job done. Today I will discuss three specific roles to which the principle of the wood chop applies: first, to your current role as a student at BYU&shy;&shy;&ndash;Idaho; second, to the role we have in our families; and third, to our role as disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First, the role of a student.</strong></p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive some personal references, but I want you to know how much I love this place and the people who come here.</p>
<p>I learned how to chop wood as a boy in Oregon. I started to understand the principle of the wood chop as a Ricks College student. At seventeen I came to Rexburg and began my college education.I lived in a basement apartment with three other guys at 156.5 East 2nd South. &nbsp;I met my wife in the 1st Ward. She later said that she chose to date the least ugly guy passing the sacrament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was a boy who came to Ricks College sporting a shiny 2.3 high school GPA. Academically, I had gone through the motions of gaining an education. Perhaps the best adjective to describe my academic performance in high school is &lsquo;mediocre&rsquo;, or maybe even better, &ldquo;slack handed&rdquo;. I decided that I was going to do better in college. I attended all my classes. I did my reading and my homework. I had great teachers like Paul Nye and Gerald Oldham.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day Brother Nye asked me to stay after American Heritage class for a minute. He said, &ldquo;Marion, you scored in the 97th percentile on this test. This is a nationally normed test, and students at top universities take this test. You&rsquo;re competing with the big boys and doing very well. I just wanted you to understand how well you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo; I left the classroom thinking, &nbsp;&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo; After that day, instead of reading the assigned chapter once, I read each chapter twice before taking the tests. What we used to refer to as &ldquo;The Spirit of Ricks&rdquo; is the miracle that happened to me thanks to Brother Nye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen it happen in the lives of many students who have been blessed by this campus. It is the spirit of awakening to our potential and understanding that the difference between failure, mediocrity, and excellence lies within the purview of our agency to choose either to benefit from &ldquo;each shining moment&rdquo; or to &ldquo;let them pass us by.&rdquo; We did not come to this campus to learn or to practice mediocrity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Brother Oldham&rsquo;s Heredity class on the first day he said, &ldquo;I can pretty much give you all your final grade today, but we&rsquo;ll go through the semester and by the end you will learn that I know most of you. The people here on the first two rows will get the A&rsquo;s. The people just above them will get the B&rsquo;s. All you people up there in the middle will get the C&rsquo;s and you people way up at the top, you will get the D&rsquo;s and F&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Of course, you can guess where I was sitting. I knew from my high school experience what kind of a student I was. I was sitting way up at the top but I said to myself that day, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know me. He can&rsquo;t determine my grade on the first day. I&rsquo;ll show him.&rdquo; I worked my heart out to prove him wrong and got an A in the class from the back of the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was hard, but I learned a lesson. I had never really realized how many distractions there are in a classroom between the back and the front. After that, I never chose to sit at the back of any college classroom. My GPA started to climb. The next verse in Proverbs, chapter 10 says, &ldquo;He that gathereth in summer is a wise son; but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.&rdquo; There are certain seasons of our lives when there is work to be done that only applies to that season. We must focus completely on the job at hand and concentrate great effort to effectively get the job done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you Brother Oldham for teaching me to ask myself, &ldquo;Do I really want to choose to put distractions between me and the task at hand?&rdquo; Doctrine and Covenants 45:26 says, &ldquo;And in that day&hellip;the whole earth shall be in commotion, and men&rsquo;s hearts shall fail them.&rdquo; This refers to our day and there is great commotion in the whole earth.&rdquo; In our society and I dare to say, on our campus, the distractions you face are like never before in the history of the world. Distractions will rob you of excellence. Distractions will stop you from accomplishing what you set out to do. Distractions will stop you from being who you want to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Hinckley said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a scrub&rdquo;. President Kimball said, &ldquo;Do it!&rdquo; In the words oft quoted by President McKay, &ldquo;What e&rsquo;re thou art, act well thy part.&rdquo; Now is the season to apply the principle of the wood chop to your role as a BYU&ndash;Idaho student, especially during finals week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second, the role in the family</strong></p>
<p>I wish to share something more precious than pearls, very personal, with the hope of conveying this message clearly. During the time of our courtship and engagement, my wife shared her patriarchal blessing with me. One phrase of it states, &ldquo;I bless you with the prospect of a home surrounded with righteousness in union with one who will honor the priesthood and build with you a home where the peace of the gospel will prevail over the sins of the world.&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;Can that possibly be me? Where and how could we build such a home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We met at Ricks College and dated a year and a half before I left on my mission. We married six months after my mission. We started our lives together with a $700 car, a $700 ring, and a $700 a month job in a plywood mill. We also started our lives together with a rich vision of the type of home we wanted to build together. We sat down and set goals for the number of children we wanted, the kind of people we wanted them to be and the kind of people we wanted to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had read a book together about President McKay, the prophet of our youth, and Sister McKay. We set goals to treat each other like the McKays; to have a life-long love affair. Perhaps most influential, we started our lives together having lived in homes where parents loved each other and loved the Savior. We were rich! We found a little plot of land in the middle of the woods where the peace of the gospel could prevail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a loving and knowledgeable father to guide us (my carpenter dad, the guy up there on top of the forms), and a year of hard work on our part, aside from our other jobs and callings, we built together our physical home where we raised our children. For 20 some years, we cut, split, hauled, and burned enough firewood from the surrounding woods to heat our home through the winters. I had much time to contemplate the principle of the wood chop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only is marriage between a man and a woman ordained of God, but a happy marriage between a man and woman is His plan for His children. You know the doctrine but let me read you excerpts from a string of scriptures that convey what Heavenly Father wants for us and our families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A &hellip; man shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.&rdquo; <a href="#_edn1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;He that loveth his wife loveth himself.&rdquo; <a href="#_edn2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Let thy soul delight in thy husband.&rdquo; <a href="#_edn3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Thou shalt live together in love.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too often we hear the lame, mediocre, slack-handed excuse to give up on marriage: &ldquo;We just drifted apart. We just aren&rsquo;t the same people we were when we fell in love.&rdquo; My wife and I started our life together with a rich vision. We had a distant dream we were working toward and we&rsquo;ve worked every day together toward our goals. If you set your sights on a star and you work together in the same spaceship every day to reach that star, you will not drift apart, but will truly become one. The day of our marriage in the Idaho Falls Temple, after everyone else had congratulated us and left the room, my mother hugged me and said, &ldquo;Son, a celestial marriage was not made today. A celestial marriage is made every day for the rest of your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a loving and knowledgeable father (our Heavenly Father) to guide us, and a lifetime of hard work on our part; we can do it. I treasure every Scripture Story Time, every Mom&rsquo;s Minute, every family prayer, every scripture reading at the breakfast table, every Family Home Evening, every moment of really being at home with my family more than any other moment or memory of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not so grateful for moments that I was there, but not really present. This life is the time to apply the principle of the wood chop in our families. It requires attention and effort. &ldquo;Do it!&rdquo; It takes chop after chop of concerted effort. Your family deserves no less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third, the role as a disciple of Jesus Christ</strong></p>
<p>In the recent general conference, Elder David A. Bednar said that true conversion,&ldquo;&hellip;includes a conscious commitment to become a disciple of Christ.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; is important. &nbsp;He explained that, quote: &ldquo;The essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ entails a fundamental and permanent change in our very nature made possible through the Savior&rsquo;s Atonement.&rdquo; Elder Bednar explained that this change, for many of us, happens, quote: &ldquo;Gradually and almost imperceptibly&rdquo; as we &ldquo;press forward with a steadfastness in Christ&rdquo; and endure in faith to the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest that the opposite is also true. We stray from the path &ldquo;gradually and almost imperceptibly&rdquo; by allowing ourselves to be distracted at key moments. We need to consciously make good decisions in our quest to become disciples of Christ. As we do so, gradually and imperceptibly, we can become more like our Savior and by so doing, gain eternal life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost exactly two decades ago, President Henry B. Eyring was assigned to visit our stake (The Rainier Oregon Stake) for a stake conference. At that time he was serving in the Presiding Bishopric of the Church. He stayed in our home in the woods and sat at our table and talked with us and our children. As a newly called stake president, I privately sought his counsel regarding a member of the stake. He told me a story about when he was a young bishop and sought counsel from then President Spencer W. Kimball.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After explaining the situation he was facing and asking President Kimball what he should do, President Eyring expected a clear answer of profound wisdom. He was surprised when President Kimball started to ask him a string of what seemed to be trivial questions about the member that Bishop Eyring was concerned about. Does he come to all his meetings? Does he arrive early or late? Does he sit in the front or the back? Does he participate in classes or just observe? And so the questions went.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That little story has profoundly impacted my life. I think of it often as I make small, but conscious decisions. Alma 37:6 says, &ldquo;Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass.&rdquo; Great things, like eternal life, hinge on our small choices. Small choices are at first &ldquo;conscious,&rdquo; effortful decisions, but eventually in our quest to be true disciples of Christ, they become part of our very nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for attending devotional, a conscious decision. Thank you for really being here, not just physically. Thank you for coming early and staying to the end, unless there are very exceptional circumstances. Those seemingly small conscious choices, with practice, eventually will become part of your very nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, with Christ-like perspective, your heart will turn from a focus on yourself to helping others. You will not want to come in late or leave early to a sacrament meeting, a class, and a devotional because you would never want to be a distraction to others or especially to detract from the spirit of the meeting. Some may suppose these seemingly trivial things are foolishness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you President Eyring for that little story about seemingly little, trivial questions. With the recent announcement that eighteen-year-old young men will be called to serve missions, I have reflected on the experience of being a mission president in the Mexico Culiacan Mission. Little shout&ndash;out to my missionaries a few or some are here today, thank you. I love my missionaries. Young men in Mexico have been serving, and have been being called at the age of eighteen for a long time. I testify that eighteen-year-olds can be and are marvelous, effective missionaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My greatest concern as a mission president was not for the group of missionaries who were eighteen-year-olds. We&rsquo;re going to have many more sister missionaries. We only had one problem with our sister missionaries and that was that we just didn&rsquo;t have enough of them. Every sister missionary in our mission was wonderful. I&rsquo;m not worried about the sisters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a mission president, my greatest concern for a group of missionaries was for the young men who had grown up in the Church and were just fulfilling missions as a cultural tradition&mdash;just going through the motions, putting in their time. &nbsp;If you aren&rsquo;t prepared with the right tools and you have an attitude that you are just there to put in your time; the work won&rsquo;t get done and the joy won&rsquo;t be there. I love what President Thueson said last week at devotional: &ldquo;If you work your mission hard, it&rsquo;s easy; if you work your mission easy, it&rsquo;s hard.&rdquo; Thank you President Thueson for giving my talk for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that applies to our role as student, our role in our family and to being disciples of Jesus Christ. When I think of half-hearted effort, this scripture comes to mind: Revelations 3:15 &ldquo;I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.&rdquo; The greatest concern was, and my greatest concern is for Heavenly Father&rsquo;s children who have the gospel and take it for granted; as if it were a health club from which to gain benefit at their convenience and whim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;They float in and out of dedication depending on whether the world&rsquo;s distractions are tantalizing them at a given moment. I could cite research on the limited capacity of the human mind to focus on more than one task, but suffice it to say, the Lord knew what he was talking about when he said, &ldquo;For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&rdquo; You can physically be in class, with your family, or in Sacrament Meeting, but whatever your heart and mind are focused on indicates what you treasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that it&rsquo;s a sin to text, to watch a video, to talk to a friend, or even play a video game, but what I am saying is you need to choose what the priority is at the moment. Allowing your mind to be distracted will rob you of the experience you came to get. It&rsquo;s interesting that in the very next verse in Matthew, right after the Lord warns us that where our treasure is, our heart will be also, he says, &ldquo;The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If during the sacrament you are envisioning the Savior walking dusty roads, picturing His example of complete dedication for us, contemplating how your life&rsquo;s walk can be more like His&mdash;then you are benefiting as you take the bread in memory of His body and His life. If you are looking at your cell phone, iPad, or envisioning what you&rsquo;ll have for dinner, then you are choosing to let commotion rob you of what you came to get. I learned that sitting at the back of the room put many distractions between me and the learning I was there to get. This &ldquo;commotion&rdquo;, this temptation to not focus on the immediate purpose at hand will eventually cause &ldquo;men&rsquo;s hearts to fail them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consciously choose not to let distractions come between you and what you came to get. &ldquo;Gradually and almost imperceptibly,&rdquo; in Elder Bednar&rsquo;s words. Through small choices, we can let our discipleship get away. Peter walked on water until he diverted his gaze, lost focus and faith, and began to sink. Referring to Peter, Elder Bednar noted, quote: &ldquo;Interestingly, this mighty Apostle had talked and walked with the Master, had witnessed many miracles, and had a strong testimony of the Savior&rsquo;s divinity. Yet, even Peter needed additional instruction from Jesus about the converting and sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost and his obligation to serve faithfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see a parallel between Peter and many of us. For a season, we have strong testimonies and serve faithfully, but then the situation changes, (perhaps we&rsquo;re released from a calling, or from a mission, or we leave the surroundings of BYU&ndash;Idaho) and, like Peter, in transition we become susceptible to becoming distracted. The Savior reminded Peter that he had bigger things to do than to &ldquo;go a fishin&rsquo;.&rdquo; The Savior reminded him that his own progress depended on his obligation to serve faithfully. Like Peter, to be true disciples, we must be willing to serve Christ with all our &ldquo;heart, might, mind, and strength.&rdquo; Will it be a sacrifice? Sometimes it will seem so in the moment, until later we realize that that small investment paid miraculous dividends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;For years my wife was known in our ward as Sister Music. She spent hours preparing charts and visuals to teach Primary children through song. Everywhere we went in the car, we would sing Primary songs. Those songs and the doctrine contained therein have sunk deep in our hearts and become part of us. That calling brought our family miraculous dividends towards the goals my wife and I had established.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a different example, I remember one of my children voicing what probably all were thinking, &ldquo;Dad, why do we always have to help Sister Pearson with her fire wood?&rdquo; A few weeks ago, my son, the one who had presented this question to me when he was a young man, who is now serving as Young Men President in his branch, hand dug a grave for a deceased member of their branch with the help of his twelve-year-old son and the young men of the branch. I&rsquo;m so proud of the man, the husband and father, my son has become. His son questioned him why they needed to dig a grave. Every calling, every service, every supposed sacrifice has repaid itself ten times over to our family in the quest for our eternal star. Sister Marjorie Pay Hinckley said, &ldquo;Our assignments are varied and they change from time to time. Don't take them lightly. Give them your full attention, your full heart and energy. Do them with enthusiasm. Do whatever you have to do this week with your whole heart and soul. To do less than this will leave you with an empty feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /> Every small but conscious decision, completed with focus and effort, is a chop toward getting the job done. I wish you success as students at BYU&ndash;Idaho. I wish you great happiness in your families. I pray that you have true joy in your walk to become more like Jesus Christ through being His true disciples. Chop away. I testify that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>
