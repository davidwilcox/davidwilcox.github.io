<p align="left" style="margin-top: -20px">Brothers and sisters, good afternoon.  Elder Bednar and I welcome you to another new semester
at Brigham Young University-Idaho.  It is a blessing for us to spend this hour of worship with
you, whether you are here in the Hart Auditorium or in any of the overflow locations across the
campus. </p>
<p>Today Sister Bednar and I desire the companionship and assistance of the Holy Ghost--perhaps
more than ever before--as we address with you a most important gospel topic, moral purity.  We
pray that the Holy Ghost will help to communicate both the intent and the importance of our
message.</p>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson forcefully declared that "The plaguing sin of this generation is sexual
immorality" (President Ezra Taft Benson, "Cleansing the Inner Vessel," <em>Ensign</em>, May 1986, p. 4).<strong>
</strong>Our message today is both eternally essential and extremely sensitive, and we and you will need
help from heaven if we are to understand one another and be "edified and rejoice together" (D&amp;C
50:22).  We are praying for you, and we hope you are praying for us.</p>
<p>We believe you will notice two distinctive aspects of our presentation this afternoon.  First, Elder
Bednar and I are at the pulpit together and will alternate turns speaking.  We believe discussing
moral purity with you requires a particular type of team approach that we have not previously
employed in a devotional setting.  We seek your help and understanding as we use this approach.</p>
<p>Second, because of the importance of this topic we will rely heavily upon the teachings and
statements of prophets of God.  To the extent possible, we will use video segments of general
conference addresses by the Brethren as they have taught principles of moral purity.  It is
important for us to hear their voices, to see their faces, and to sense and feel their sincerity and
the urgency as they preach powerful principles of purity. </p>
<p>We have organized our message around two central questions.  Question 1:  Why is moral purity
so important?  And question 2:  What are the blessings associated with moral purity?  We invite
both your attention and your concentration, and we pray that you will listen to understand with
both your mind and your heart.</p>
<p><center><strong><u>Question 1:  Why is moral purity so important?</u></strong></center>
</p>
<p>The Proclamation on the Family clearly and concisely describes the central role of marriage, of
procreation, and of the family to our Heavenly Father's plan of happiness:</p>
<p>	We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a
man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's
plan for the eternal destiny of His children.</p>
<p>	All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God.  Each is a
beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine
nature and destiny.  Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal,
mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.</p>
<p>	In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their
Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a
physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and
ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life.  The divine
plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. 
Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for
individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.</p>
<p>	The first commandment that God gave Adam and Eve pertained to their potential
for parenthood as husband and wife.  We declare that God's commandment for
His Children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force.  We further
declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be
employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.</p>
<p>	We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. 
We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God's eternal plan.  ("The
Family: A Proclamation to the World," <em>Ensign</em>, November 1995, p. 102.)</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father was described by the Prophet Joseph Smith as "God the First, the Creator"
(<u>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</u>, p. 190).  As the sons and daughters of God, we have the
potential to become like Him.  The Father has entrusted us with a portion of His creative power
and provided specific guidelines for the proper use of that sacred ability within the bonds of
marriage to create life and establish an eternal family.  How we feel about and use that sacred
power in this life, in large measure, will determine whether additional creative power will be ours
in the life to come.  Our Eternal Father's divine plan of happiness enables us to experience the
responsibilities and the blessings of marriage, to feel the joys and the sorrows of parenthood and
family life, and to progress in mortality toward what we can ultimately become in eternity.</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer has taught plainly about the importance of procreation in the Father's
plan:</p>
<p>	There was provided in our bodies--and this is sacred--a power of creation, a light,
so to speak, that has the power to kindle other lights.  This gift was to be used
only within the sacred bonds of marriage.  Through the exercise of this power of
creation, a mortal body may be conceived, a spirit enter into it, and a new soul
born into this life.</p>
<p>	This power is good.  It can create and sustain family life, and it is in family life
that we find the fountains of happiness.  It is given to virtually every individual
who is born into mortality.  It is a sacred and significant power, and I repeat, my
young friends, that this power is good. . . .</p>
<p>	The power of creation--or may we say procreation--is not just an incidental part
of the plan: it is essential to it.  Without it the plan could not proceed.  The misuse
of it may disrupt the plan.</p>
<p>	Much of the happiness that may come to you in this life will depend on how you
use this sacred power of creation. . .&nbsp;</p>
<p>	Again I want to tell you young people that this power within you is good.  It is a
gift from God our Father.  In the righteous exercise of it as in nothing else, we
may come close to him.</p>
<p>	We can have, in a small way, much that our Father in heaven has as he governs us,
his children.  No greater school or testing place can be imagined.</p>
<p>	Is it any wonder, then, that in the Church marriage is so sacred and so important? 
Can you understand why your marriage, which releases these powers of creation
for your use, should be the most carefully planned, the most solemnly considered
step in your life?  Ought we to consider it unusual that the Lord directed that
temples be constructed for the purpose of performing marriage ceremonies? 
(Boyd K. Packer, "Why Stay Morally Clean," <em>Ensign,</em> July 1972, p.&nbsp;111.)</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks also has emphasized the importance of the sacred power of procreation:</p>
<p>	The power to create mortal life is the most exalted power God has given his
children.  Its use was mandated in the first commandment, but another important
commandment was given to forbid its misuse.  The emphasis we place on the law
of chastity is explained by our understanding of the purpose of our procreative
powers in the accomplishment of God's plan.</p>
<p>	The expression of our procreative powers is pleasing to God, but he has
commanded that this be confined within the relationship of marriage.  President
Spencer W. Kimball taught that "in the context of lawful marriage, the intimacy of
sexual relations is right and divinely approved.  There is nothing unholy or
degrading about sexuality in itself, for by that means men and women join in a
process of creation and in an expression of love" (<em>The Teachings of Spencer W.
Kimball,</em> ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], p.&nbsp;311).</p>
<p>	Outside the bonds of marriage, all uses of the procreative power are to one degree
or another a sinful degrading and perversion of the most divine attribute of men
and women.  (Elder Dallin H. Oaks, "The Great Plan of Happiness," <em>Ensign,</em>
November 1993, p.&nbsp;74.)</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the sacred intimacy described by these apostles and prophets of God is
central to the Father's plan.  It is not merely an appetite to be satisfied; it is not a form of
recreation or a type of entertainment to be selfishly pursued; it is not a curiosity to be explored; it
is not a conquest to be achieved; and it is not simply an act to be performed.  Rather, intimacy in
mortality should be a grand expression of the love and deep commitment an individual has for
his or her spouse, an outward expression of the inner desire to become one, and the ultimate
expression of our divine nature and potential.  It is a foreshadowing of and a preparation for
eternity and what we will be there.  We can begin to become in mortality what we will be in
eternity.</p>
<p>As Elder Oaks has summarized:</p>
<p>	Some who do not know the plan of salvation behave like promiscuous animals,
but Latter-day Saints--especially those who are under sacred covenants--have no
such latitude.  We are solemnly responsible to God for the destruction or misuse
of the creative powers he has placed within us.  (Elder Dallin H. Oaks, "The Great
Plan of Happiness," <em>Ensign,</em> November 1993, p.&nbsp;74.)</p>
<p>The doctrines Lucifer works most diligently to distort and attack are the ones that really matter
the most to us individually, to our families, and to the world.  The great plan of happiness
enables each of us to obtain a physical body and makes possible a forever family.  Where is the
adversary presently focusing his most direct and diabolical attacks?  Upon our beliefs about and
uses of the physical body and upon the family.  Satan does not have a body, and he cannot have a
family.  He desires that all of us would become miserable like unto himself.  And the adversary
relentlessly works to distort the foundational doctrines he hates the most (see Psalms 11:1-2,
JST).</p>
<p>Moral purity is so important because the power to create mortal life is an essential element in the
divine plan of happiness.  The means by which mortal life is created are divinely appointed, and
children are entitled to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete
fidelity.  Our appropriate use of procreative power in this life is a preparation for even greater
creative power in the world to come.</p>
<p>Because moral purity is so important, the Lord's servants frequently and consistently raise a
voice of warning to those who are tempted to misuse or tamper with these sacred creative
powers.  The following counsel was given by Elder Boyd K. Packer in 1972:</p>
<p>	You grow up in a society where before you is the constant invitation to tamper
with these sacred powers.</p>
<p>I want to counsel you and I want you to remember these words.</p>
<p>	Do not let anyone at all touch or handle your body, not anyone!  Those who tell
you otherwise proselyte you to share their guilt.  We teach you to maintain your
innocence.</p>
<p>	Turn away from any who would persuade you to experiment with these life-giving
powers.</p>
<p>	That such indulgence is widely accepted in society today is not enough!  For both
parties to willingly consent to such indulgence is not enough!</p>
<p>	To imagine that it is a normal expression of affection is not enough to make it
right.</p>
<p>	The only righteous use of this sacred power is within the covenant of marriage.</p>
<p>	Never misuse these sacred powers.  (Boyd K. Packer, "Why Stay Morally Clean,"
<em>Ensign</em>, July 1972, p. 111.)</p>
<p>Now please notice the consistency of the counsel provided by Elder Richard G. Scott twenty-six
years later in 1998:</p>
<p>	Make sure that as you are seeking an eternal companion that you do nothing
which will offend the Spirit.  Satan tempts a weaker individual to rationalize that
when two are in love and agree that sexual intimacies can be performed, that such
things are acceptable.  They positively are not.  The boundaries of appropriate
behavior are defined by God.</p>
<p>	Strongly tied to the sacred, private parts of the body are powerful emotions
intended to be used within the covenant of marriage between a man and woman in
ways that are appropriate and acceptable to them both.  They are an important part
of the love and trust that bond a husband and wife together and prepare them for
the responsibilities of a family.  They bring the blessing of children.  These
emotions are not to be stimulated or used for personal gratification outside of the
covenant of marriage.  Do not touch the private, sacred parts of another person's
body to stimulate those emotions.  Do not allow anyone to do that with you, with
or without clothing.  Do not arouse those emotions in your own body.  These
things are wrong.  Do not do them.  Such practices would undermine your ability
to be inspired by the Holy Ghost in the vitally important decisions you must make
for your future.  They lead to binding addictions and grievous transgressions. 
(Richard G. Scott, "The Power of Righteousness," <em>Ensign</em>, November 1998, p.
68.)</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell has warned about the seductive strategies Satan employs to entice men
and women to violate the seventh commandment: "Thou shalt not commit adultery" (Exodus
20:14):</p>
<p>	In an age rightly concerned with truth in advertising, how intellectually insulting
are certain deceptive labels: <em>Ecstasy</em> should read <em>misery; Rave</em> is really a <em>mournful
mutter</em> emanating from sensuality gone amok.  For instance, some participants
foolishly think a little lewd dancing is harmless.  These individuals do "not sin
ignorantly" (3 Nephi 6:18).  By imitating and by underestimating the enemy, they
end up compromising themselves, while confusing and disappointing their
friends!</p>
<p>	Ever wonder why the sensual scene so often features flashing but fading lights? 
Or why all the reinforcing glitz?  Or why all the loudness masquerading as music? 
Because, fearful of the dawn, evil cannot stand the steady scrutiny of bright truth,
nor can it endure the quiet reflections of soul-searching!</p>
<p>	Thus the drumbeat of desensitization deadens the tastebuds of the soul by
responding <em>illegitimately</em> to the <em>legitimate</em> need for belonging and for love, as
predators and victims sadly become "past feeling" (1 Nephi 17:45; Ephesians
4:19; Moroni 9:20).   (Neal A. Maxwell, "The Seventh Commandment: A Shield,"
<em>Ensign</em>, November&nbsp;2001, p. 78.)</p>
<p>These prophetic warnings are now and always have been direct, specific, and emphatic precisely
because moral purity is so eternally important.</p>
<p><center><strong><u>Question 2:  What are the blessings associated with moral purity?</u></strong></center>
</p>
<p>Prophets and apostles have spoken definitively about the blessings associated with moral purity. 
President Ezra Taft Benson has taught:</p>
<p>	Do not be misled by Satan's lies.  There is no lasting happiness in immorality. 
There is no joy to be found in breaking the law of chastity.  Just the opposite is
true.  There may be momentary pleasure.  For a time it may seem like everything
is wonderful.  But quickly the relationship will sour.  Guilt and shame set in.  We
become fearful that our sins will be discovered.  We must sneak and hide, lie and
cheat.  Love begins to die.  Bitterness, jealousy, anger, and even hate begin to
grow.  All of these are the natural results of sin and transgression.</p>
<p>	On the other hand, when we obey the law of chastity and keep ourselves morally
clean, we will experience the blessings of increased love and peace, greater trust
and respect for our marital partners, deeper commitment to each other, and,
therefore, a deep and significant sense of joy and happiness.  (President Ezra Taft
Benson, "The Law of Chastity," <em>BYU 1987-88 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</em>
[1988], p.&nbsp;51.)</p>
<p>Please notice the specific blessings promised by President Benson: love and peace, trust and
respect for our marital partners, commitment to each other, and true joy and happiness. 
Certainly, moral purity and worthiness are the gateway to appropriate feelings of spiritual worth,
confidence, and lasting joy.</p>
<p>Important and timeless counsel about moral purity was given by a father to his son right here in
Rexburg, Idaho.  From 1917 until 1931, George S. Romney served as the president of Ricks
Academy.  His son Marion, a student at the academy, excelled in athletics.  Later in his life
Marion G. Romney served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and as a
counselor in the First Presidency of the Church.  In a 1979 general conference address, President
Marion G. Romney recalled this important lesson about the law of chastity he learned from his
father as he departed Rexburg to serve as a missionary in Australia.   Please note President
Romney's teachings about the law of chastity and his description of the supernal blessings
associated with that law:</p>
<p>	And now, the third specific commandment to which I direct your attention is,
"Thou shalt not commit adultery" (D&amp;C 42:24).</p>
<p>	You will recall, of course, Alma's teaching his son Corianton that unchastity is
the most serious offense there is in the sight of God, save murder only (see Alma
39:3-5).  You will remember, too, these words from Paul's epistle to the
Corinthians:</p>
<p>	"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in
you?</p>
<p>	"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy" (1&nbsp;Corinthians 3:16-17).</p>
<p>	. . . I remember how my father impressed the seriousness of unchastity upon my
mind.  He and I were standing in the railroad station in Rexburg, Idaho, in the
early morning of November 12, 1920.  We heard the train whistle and knew that
in three minutes I would be on my way to Australia to fill a mission.  In that short
interval my father said to me, among other things, "My son, you are going a long
way from home.  But your mother and I, your brother and sisters, will be with you
constantly in our thoughts and prayers, we shall rejoice with you in your
successes, and we shall sorrow with you in your disappointments.  When you are
released and return, we shall be glad to greet you and welcome you back into the
family circle.  But remember this, my son, we would rather come to this station
and take your body off the train in a casket than to have you come home unclean,
having lost your virtue."</p>
<p>	I pondered that statement at the time.  I did not then have the full understanding of
it that my father had, but I have never forgotten it.</p>
<p>	I can think of no blessings to be more fervently desired than those promised to the
pure and the virtuous.  Jesus spoke of specific rewards for different virtues but
reserved the greatest, so it seems to me, for the pure in heart, "for they," said he,
"shall see God" (Matthew 5:8).  And not only shall they see the Lord, but they
shall feel at home in his presence.</p>
<p>	Here is his promise--the Savior's promise: "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts
unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God" (D&amp;C
121:45).   (Marion G. Romney, "Trust in the Lord," <em>Ensign</em>, May 1979, p. 40.)</p>
<p>Elder M. Russell Ballard also has described the blessings related to moral purity.  Note the
similarity between the blessings promised by Elder Ballard and those just described by President
Romney:</p>
<p>	Recently I talked with several groups of young men and women in Utah and
Idaho.  They told me that some of our youth feel that they can be immoral during
their teen years and then repent when they decide to go on a mission or be married
in the temple.  Some young men talk about a mission as a time when they will be
forgiven from their past sins.  They have the notion that a few transgressions now
are no big deal because they can repent quickly, go on a mission, and then live
happily ever after.</p>
<p>	Young men, please believe me when I tell you that this scenario is a gross
deception by Satan; it is a fairy tale.  Sin will always, <em>always,</em> result in suffering. 
It may come sooner, or it may come later, but it will come.  The scriptures state
that you will "stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of God" (Jacob&nbsp;6:9)
and that you will experience "a lively sense of . . . guilt, and pain, and anguish"
(Mosiah 2:38).</p>
<p>	A related misconception is that repentance is easy.  President Kimball said that
"one has not begun to repent until he has suffered intensely for his sins. . . .  If a
person hasn't suffered, he hasn't repented" (<u>The Teachings of Spencer W.
Kimball</u>, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982, pp. 88, 99).  You need only talk to a
person who has truly repented of serious sin to understand that the momentary
pleasure of an immoral act is simply not worth the pain that always follows.</p>
<p>	The youth told me that some are tempted to be immoral because they want to be
accepted by their peers.  For the young men, it may mean acceptance based on
some sort of macho image.  For the young women, it may be the need to feel they
are accepted by having a boyfriend.  Acceptance by your peers must not come at
the expense of your virtue and self-esteem.  King Benjamin indicates that those
guilty of sin will "shrink from the presence of the Lord" (Mosiah 2:38).  In a very
real way, those who have been immoral shrink from the presence of others: their
friends, their parents, other members of their family, and Church leaders.</p>
<p>	Now, let us consider the grand blessings the Lord has promised those who are
obedient to the commandment to be morally clean. You never need to repent of a
sin you have not committed.  That seems obvious, but I want to emphasize it. 
Repentance is a great blessing, but you should never make yourself sick just so
you can try out the remedy.  You are infinitely better to maintain your spiritual
health by staying morally clean.  If you feel confident in the presence of your
parents, peers, and priesthood leaders, you can sense how you will feel when you
have the confidence and acceptance of the Savior.  (M. Russell Ballard, "Purity
Precedes Power," <em>Ensign</em>, November 1990, p.&nbsp;35.)</p>
<p>As indicated by President Benson, President Romney, and Elder Ballard, moral purity invites the
greatest blessings men and women can experience in mortality--appropriate spiritual confidence
in the presence of family, friends, church associates, and, ultimately, the Savior.  As we better
understand the importance of and blessings associated with moral purity, each of us will have a
greater resolve to live clean lives and to let virtue garnish our thoughts unceasingly (D&amp;C
121:45).</p>
<p><center><strong><u>Prophetic Counsel to Married Students</u></strong></center>
</p>
<p>Now, a word of prophetic counsel and caution in particular to married couples:</p>
<p> <em>If you are married, avoid flirtations of any kind.  </em>Sometimes we hear of a married
man going to lunch with his secretary or other women in the office.  Men and
women who are married sometimes flirt and tease with members of the opposite
sex.  So-called harmless meetings are arranged, or inordinate amounts of time are
spent together.  In all of these cases, people rationalize by saying that these are
natural expressions of friendship.  But what may appear to be harmless teasing or
simply having a little fun with someone of the opposite sex can easily lead to
more serious involvement and eventual infidelity.</p>
<p>	A good question to ask ourselves is this: Would my spouse be pleased if he or she
knew I was doing this?  Would a wife be pleased to know that her husband
lunches alone with his secretary? Would a husband be pleased if he saw his wife
flirting and being coy with another man?  My beloved brothers and sisters, this is
what Paul meant when he said: "Abstain from all appearance of evil" (1
Thessalonians 5:22).  (President Ezra Taft Benson, "The Law of Chastity," <em>BYU
1987-88 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</em> [1988], p.&nbsp;52.)</p>
<p>Marital status in and of itself does not exempt or automatically protect a man or a woman from
temptations related to the law of chastity.  Furthermore, there are also bounds for the appropriate
expression of love between a husband and a wife.  Dignity, purity, and mutual acceptability
ought to characterize our most intimate relationships.  The more we stray from the simple in our
expression of affection, the closer we approach the perverted.  Loyalty to your spouse,
consideration, and, most importantly, the whisperings of the Holy Ghost will help you to know
what is right and to recognize the path that will lead you away from temptation.</p>
<p><center><strong><u>The Principle of Repentance</u></strong></center>
</p>
<p>It is likely that some who are listening to this message today have need to repent of moral
transgression.  The Savior is often referred to as the Great Physician, and this title has major
symbolic and literal significance.  Brothers and sisters, all of us have experienced the pain
associated with a physical injury or wound.  When we are in pain, we typically seek relief and are
grateful for the medication and treatments that help to alleviate our suffering.  Now, please
consider sin as a spiritual wound that causes guilt or, as described by Alma to his son Corianton,
"remorse of conscience" (Alma 42:18).  Guilt is to our spirit what pain is to our body--a warning
of danger and a protection from additional damage.  From the Atonement of the Savior flows the
soothing salve that can heal our spiritual wounds and remove guilt.  However, this salve can only
be applied through the principles of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, and consistent
obedience.  The results of sincere repentance are peace of conscience, comfort, and spiritual
healing and renewal.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the extent and intensity of our repentance must match the nature
and severity of our sins--especially for Latter-day Saints who are under sacred covenant.  Serious
spiritual wounds take both time and assistance to heal completely and fully.  Please hear and
heed the counsel of Elder Richard G. Scott:</p>
<p>	For a moment I speak to anyone that has succumbed to serious temptation.  Please
stop now.  You can do it with the help from an understanding parent, bishop, or
stake president.  Serious transgression such as immorality requires the help of one
who holds keys of authority, such as a bishop or stake president, to quietly work
out the repentance process to make sure that it is complete and appropriately done. 
Do not make the mistake to believe that because you have confessed a serious
transgression that you have repented of it.  That is an essential step, but it is not all
that is required.  Nor assume that because someone did not ask you all the
important details of a transgression, that you need not mention them.  You
personally must make sure that the bishop or stake president understands those
details so that he can help you properly through the process of repentance for full
forgiveness.  The Savior promised:</p>
<p>	"Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord,
remember them no more.</p>
<p>	"By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them
and forsake them" (D&amp;C 58:42-43).  (Richard G. Scott, "The Power of
Righteousness," <em>Ensign</em>, November 1998, p.&nbsp;68.)</p>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has also provided important direction and counsel:</p>
<p>	I have declared here the solemn word of revelation that the spirit and the body
constitute the soul of man, and that through the Atonement of Christ the body
shall rise from the grave to unite with the spirit in an eternal existence.  That body
is therefore something to be kept pure and holy.  Do not be afraid of soiling its
hands in honest labor.  Do not be afraid of scars that may come in defending the
truth or fighting for the right, but beware scars that spiritually disfigure, that come
to you in activities you should not have undertaken, that befall you in places
where you should not have gone.  Beware the wounds of any battle in which you
have been fighting on the wrong side.</p>
<p>	If some few of you are carrying such wounds--and I know that you are--to you is
extended the peace and renewal of repentance available through the atoning
sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.  In such serious matters the path of repentance
is not easily begun nor painlessly traveled.  But the Savior of the world will walk
that essential journey with you.  He will strengthen you when you waver.  He will
be your light when it seems most dark.  He will take your hand and be your hope
when hope seems all you have left.  His compassion and mercy, with all their
cleansing and healing power, are freely given to all who truly wish complete
forgiveness and will take the steps that lead to it.</p>
<p>	I bear witness of the great plan of life, of the powers of godliness, of mercy and
forgiveness and the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ--all of which have
profound meaning in matters of moral cleanliness.  I testify that we are to glorify
God in our body and in our spirit.  I thank heaven for legions of the young who are
doing just that and helping others do the same.  I thank heaven for homes where
this is taught.  That lives of personal purity may be reverenced by all, I pray in the
name of purity Himself, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.   (Jeffrey R. Holland,
"Personal Purity," <em>Ensign, </em>November 1998, p.&nbsp;75.)</p>
<p><center><strong><u>Don't Sell Yourselves Short</u></strong></center>
</p>
<p>Just a short time ago President Gordon B. Hinckley was on our campus to attend the dedication
of the Hinckley Building.  Those who heard and saw and felt President Hinckley's expression of
love for the youth of the Church will never forget it.  And in his remarks he spoke specifically
about worthiness and purity and integrity:</p>
<p>	First, I want to tell you that I love you.  I love you kids, you wonderful young
people of this Church.  I love you. . . .   I thank you for your strength; for your
willingness to do the right thing; for your desire to serve the Lord; for your
capacity to help build the kingdom; for the fact that you get on your knees and say
your prayers, as I know you do; for the fact that you pray to the Lord to help you,
to guide you in the things you do, as I know you do.</p>
<p>	God bless you for what you are and who you are.</p>
<p>	Now, don't ever do a cheap or a tawdry or a mean or evil thing, my dear young
friends.  You don't have to engage in these things.  The world is on a slippery
slide; it's going downhill, and it is going fast.  And you are as a beacon on a
hill--young people of rectitude and virtue and decency and goodness.  Remain that
way.  Do not destroy your effectiveness.  Do not become involved in any kind of
behavior which would destroy you, injure you, hurt you, debilitate you in any way
whatever.  You don't have to do those things.  You can stand above them.  You
must stand above them!  The world will look to you as the years pass, of that I
have no doubt whatever.</p>
<p>	. . . Educate your minds and your spirits, and never lose sight of the fact that you
are a child of God with a divine destiny and capability of doing great and good
and wonderful things.  Don't sell yourselves short.  Don't cheapen yourselves. 
You know who you are.  Each of you knows that you are a child of God and that
your Heavenly Father expects something great and noble and good of you.</p>
<p>	. . . God bless this great institution.  May heaven smile upon it and all who come
here and use it.  May its name be spread for good across the earth as good men
and women, educated here and going forth to serve, stand with honesty and
integrity before the world as men and women of faith and accomplishment and
goodness and integrity, is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. 
(Dedication of the Gordon B. Hinckley Building, Brigham Young University-Idaho, October 22, 2002.)</p>
<p>Our dear young brothers and sisters, oh how we love you!  Together we testify of the truthfulness
of the teachings we have reviewed this afternoon from apostles and prophets.  The love the
Brethren have for us is manifested in the directness and clarity of their teachings.  We pray that
all of us can now better understand the importance of the sacred powers of procreation in the
Father's eternal plan.  We know and witness that these doctrines and principles are true and that
moral purity is eternally important.  It is, as President Packer taught, the "very key" ("Why Stay
Morally Clean," <em>Ensign,</em> July 1972, p. 111) to happiness here and hereafter.  May each of us
increase in moral purity, we earnestly pray, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">I take for my theme a passage from the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 19:38.   "Pray always
and I will pour out my Spirit upon you."  </p>
<p>Oh, my dear brothers and sisters, I know this is true.  With all my heart, I know that this is true. 
Prayer, regular sincere communication with the Father in the Name of the Son, brings spiritual
direction, spiritual power into our lives.</p>
<p><strong><u>Prayer in the Morning</u></strong><u></u></p>
<p>Are you praying every day, morning and evening, and perhaps several times throughout the day,
especially in your math class?  </p>
<p>As a bishop, when I would meet with members one on one, I would frequently ask the question. 
"Are you praying every day morning and evening?"  Occasionally, the answer came, "Well, not
as much as I should?"  Then, I would ask, "What more should you be doing?"  The answer, "I
don't pray in the morning as much as I should.?  I just pile out of bed at the last minute, look in
the mirror and nearly faint at the sight, catch a quick breakfast, if any at all, and rush off to work,
school or wherever."  </p>
<p>Is this a pattern in your life?  Are you missing that morning communication with the Father? 
Let's refer again to our theme scripture.  "Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you?" 
Could it not also be said then,  "Pray occasionally  and I will give you my spirit occasionally."</p>
<p>When we pray in the morning as individuals, as roommates, as families, we receive from the
Lord, as it were, an umbrella for protection as we go out into a stormy world.  Oh, how we need
that protection.  From 3 Nephi 18:18, we read:</p>
<p> <em>"Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into
temptation; for Satan desires to have you..."</em></p>
<p>That makes one shiver just a bit.</p>
<p>This prayer business is a big deal!  You have probably experienced what I have, when halfway
through the morning, everything seems so confused.  You just can't seem to prepare for a class,
get anything meaningful done, and then it hits you, that is, the Holy Ghost hits you, and He
whispers,</p>
<p>	"<em>Ere you left your room this morning, did you think to pray?</em>"</p>
<p>And you say to yourself, "O, no wonder, I haven't even asked for help and you take a moment to
ask for forgiveness in prayer in your heart and then to plead with the Father to help you with your
current task.  And then, as the Nephites would say, "And it came to pass."  The ideas begin to
flow.  You can think more clearly.  But most importantly, the Spirit whispers peace to your soul. 
And you take a deep breath and life is good. </p>
<p>That is how it works.  I know that it is so!!  The Spirit brings peace from an outside source, not
of your own making.  Now you can bear what you thought you could not bear.  Burdens are
lifted.  Your thoughts are more organized. You know that God knows you and really cares.  In
Doctrine and Covenants 67:1-2, He reassures us by saying:</p>
<p> <em>"Behold and hearken, O ye elders </em>[we would add, "O ye my sons and daughters] <em>of my
church . . . whose prayers I have heard, and whose hearts I know, and whose desires
have come up before me</em>.</p>
<p> <em>Behold and lo, mine eyes are upon you . . ."</em> (Doctrine and Covenants 67:1-2)</p>
<p>Heavenly Father knows our hearts.  His eyes are upon us.  He hears our prayers.</p>
<p><strong><u>A Seoul Korea Missionary Experience</u></strong><u></u></p>
<p>Perhaps this true account from two missionaries serving in the Seoul Korea Mission, while I was
mission president there, will help to illustrate.  Elder Craig Drew writes,</p>
<p> <em>I recall walking in the vicinity of the Seoul train station one bitterly cold evening, as we
made our way to an investigator's home, located in the middle of a dilapidated shanty
town.  It gave new meaning to "the other side of the tracks."  For a young nineteen year
old, raised in a comfortable middle class home, in the isolated reaches of northern
Ontario, Canada, without much exposure to the world, it truly was a wake up call.  </em></p>
<p><em>	Elder Richard Rife, my first  senior companion, had met a young married man, Mr.
Chang, a few weeks prior and had begun to teach him, his wife, and their little boy, Do
Young.</em></p>
<p><em>	As we arrived at their home, I was overcome by the cramped quarters of their humble
house.  It consisted of a room, no larger than five feet by ten feet, where the family lived,
ate and slept.  The February temperatures were bitterly cold.  Thin rice paper covered
the walls as the family  sat in traditional Korean style, and draped a large comforter over
us in an attempt to keep us warm.</em></p>
<p><em>	The Chang family had a special spirit about them, filled with  humility, and were
wonderful hosts, as we began to teach them the discussions.  </em></p>
<p><em>	On one of our visits, a short time later, Mrs. Chang, who was holding her agitated son in
her arms, met us in the small lane leading to their home.  It appeared she had been
crying for some time.  She told us that a day or so prior, little Do Young had slipped and
fallen ,and landed on a large, burning charcoal briquette,  searing his bare bottom with a
major third degree burn.  I clearly recall the blistered and pus- filled wound that marred
his tiny body.  At that time, the Korean health care system had nothing for its poor.  A
doctor's visit was out of the question for the financially strapped family.</em></p>
<p><em>	Instead of teaching one of the prescribed lessons that evening, Elder Rife felt impressed
to teach the family about the power of the priesthood and the different ways it can be
used, including the blessing of the sick and afflicted. The Chang's agreed to fast and pray
with us the following day, and then we would return that evening to give their little son,
Do Young, a special blessing.  </em></p>
<p><em>	Not one to be considered a shining example of fasting prior to my mission, a day of
fasting, combined with a full day of missionary work with a dedicated companion/trainer,
was a taxing experience.  I had been raised in a part member family where the priesthood
was not in our home.  This was my first experience with exercising the priesthood and
giving a blessing of this magnitude. </em></p>
<p><em>	The next evening, we arrived at the Chang home and found father, mother, and child
anxiously  waiting.  Sister Chang smiled as she told us how hungry she was, and what a
challenge fasting  had been for her, yet how good she felt inside.  After a short visit and
further teaching, I had the opportunity to anoint Do Young with oil. I had been working
hard all day to memorize the anointing prayer in Korean.  Elder Rife and I then joined
together as he sealed the anointing.  The spirit was strong as we finished. The Chang's
both had tears of gratitude running down their cheeks as they felt the special spirit that
visited their humble home that evening.  </em></p>
<p><em>	As we departed, Elder Rife once again expressed the importance of faith and told the
couple their child would be healed through their faithfulness.  The following evening we
paid another visit and were overjoyed to find little Do Young's burn had formed a scab
and the infection had subsided.  Within a week, all that was left was a red scar that had
once been a third degree burn.  I learned, by first hand experience, that our Heavenly
Father loves all his children, especially the meek and humble Chang family in Seoul,
Korea, and that through the power of the priesthood great things can and do happen. 
</em>(Craig Drew, Personal History)</p>
<p>Oh yes, brothers and sisters, great things can and do happen.  There is no question that prayer
brings down the powers of heaven in  miraculous ways as evidenced by the above account. 
However, the ongoing day-to-day fruits of prayer are usually manifested quietly in the inner-reaches of your heart.</p>
<p><strong><u>A Korean Queen</u></strong><u></u></p>
<p>Another account from Korea comes from a close and dear missionary companion of mine, David
A. Strebe.  He writes in his personal history, <em></em></p>
<p><em>	We were walking up the dirt road to reach the group of homes at the top of the hill. It was
dry and very warm. Everything was hard and so very dry. The monsoon rains had not yet
begun for the summer.   The only moisture was in a shallow ditch at the side of the road.</em></p>
<p><em>	The mud in the ditch was black as tar and had an odor all of its own.  I didn't notice the
ditch and stepped into the black smelly slime which oozed into my shoe.  We had several
stops to make, several miles to go, and I was really in a dilemma.</em></p>
<p><em>	Below us, coming up the hill, was a Korean lady. She had a yoke across her shoulders.
On each end of the yoke hung a five gallon bucket filled with water. In 1959, most homes
in Seoul, Korea  had no water.  Drinking water had to be carried, sometimes for long
distances.</em></p>
<p><em>	What a heavy burden  she carried. </em></p>
<p><em>	When she came up to me, she noticed the grimy predicament that I was in.  Without a
word, she put down her load. To my amazement, she knelt in the dirt in front of me, lifted
my foot and removed my shoe and sock. Patiently, she cleaned the sock and shoe with the
precious water she had carried so far.  When she was satisfied that the shoe and sock
were as clean as she could make them, she again lifted my foot and washed it.  Then she
dried it with the hem of her long dress.  She restored sock and shoe to my foot. I was
overwhelmed, overcome with gratitude. </em></p>
<p><em>	"Thank you so much," I said, "What can I do for you?"</em></p>
<p><em>	"Nothing," she replied meekly.</em></p>
<p><em>	"Please, may I carry your burden to your home?"</em></p>
<p><em>	"No. My neighbors will mock me."</em></p>
<p><em>	"Oh, please let me do something."</em></p>
<p><em>	"No. My children will laugh at me."</em></p>
<p><em>	"May I come to your home and offer a prayer?"</em></p>
<p><em>	"No. My husband will beat me. I am just a dog."</em></p>
<p><em>	"Oh no! Not so sister," I cried.</em></p>
<p><em>	Seemingly there was nothing to do for this wonderful lady. As she knelt before me to
finish tying my shoe, I laid my hands on her head, and said a prayer, and gave her a
blessing.  I  blessed her that God's influence would come to her in this life, and that
honor would come to her in the life hereafter. I promised her that some day she would be
honored as a queen, "<u>in the name of Jesus Christ</u>. Amen."</em>  (David A. Strebe, Personal
History)</p>
<p><strong><u>Prayer, extremely powerful in the lives of others</u></strong><u></u></p>
<p>Most often, our prayers are directed heavenward for someone else.  Just as Elder Strebe blessed
and prayed for this dear lady-perhaps the very best thing he could have ever done in those
circumstances--you and I are constantly pleading through prayer for others.  So often, we speak
and testify concerning what prayer has done for us.  But we can also give a resounding
"hallelujah" for the miraculous intervention we have seen come into the lives of loved ones,
family members, investigators, even roommates, in answer to prayer.  </p>
<p>Petitions regarding macro issues such as praying for our government leaders, for the welfare of
nations, for rain in due season, and for our beloved prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, also can make
a significance difference.  For the Lord has spoken on this issue, as He declares in The Book of
Mormon, Alma 10:22-23:</p>
<p> <em>Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in
the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction . . .</em></p>
<p><em>	But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared.</em></p>
<p>Did you get that?  The prayers of the righteous, that is, those seeking to live the gospel, were the
means of sparing from destruction an entire nation.  Don't forget to pray and to pray mightily for
our world.  We live in such perilous times.  Yes, your little prayers can make a big difference.</p>
<p><strong><u>A Lesson Learned</u></strong></p>
<p>I had the special opportunity for several years to supervise the work of about 85 seminary and
institute teachers here in Eastern Idaho. One of the great lessons I learned, among many, came as
I interviewed these teachers and their spouses.  I would inquire as to their well-being and that of
their families.  I found that not one was free from some type of burden - sickness, financial
challenges, a disobedient child, deep concerns about students, etc.  </p>
<p>Often, at the conclusion of those interviews, I would promise the couple that I would remember
them in my prayers.  As I would leave those interviews, and drive away from the building, I
would talk with the Lord.  "Oh, Lord, bless this dear couple.  They are trying so diligently and yet
they are burdened heavily.  Please, oh please, be with them."  </p>
<p>What was the lesson I learned?  I felt the Spirit time and time again reassuring me that prayers
really work, that my prayers would make a difference.  Brothers and Sisters, your prayers for
others really make a difference.  Never give up praying, never!  Note this profound counsel from
the Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 32:8-9:</p>
<p> <em>. . . For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know
that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he 
must not pray.</em></p>
<p><em>	But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always and not faint. (2 Nephi 32:8-9)</em></p>
<p><strong><u>An Experience of a seminary teacher</u></strong><u></u></p>
<p>I remember on one occasion visiting with a seminary teacher, and he told me of the following
experience he had with his very young daughter.  Of course, as a priesthood holder father often
does, he had blessed his daughter on several occasions when she had been ill.  </p>
<p>One day, he was not feeling well and was in bed.  His little daughter came to him and asked,
"Daddy, can I give you a blessing?"  His reply was something like, "Sure, would you like to pray
for me."  The prayers that had been most impressed on her mind, which she had given, were
prayers to bless the food.  So, she began her prayer for her father with, "Heavenly Father, please
bless this food."  And my seminary teacher colleague assured me that, indeed, Heavenly Father
did "bless the food" that day. </p>
<p>You may sometimes feel that you are inadequate in prayer, that perhaps you don't say the right
things.  Don't worry, God knows your heart, and he will . . . "bless this food."</p>
<p>Ask and ye shall receive," is a very strong promise, wouldn't you say.  When you loft a prayer
heavenward, something is bound to happen, for you and/or others for whom you have concern. 
Be of good cheer and do not fear.</p>
<p><strong><u>A personal experience in Japan</u></strong></p>
<p>My wife, Carol-whom I love so much- and I spent five years living in Asia where I was serving
in the Asia North Area Presidency.  On one occasion, I was presiding over a conference of the
Tokyo East Stake.  President Hosoya, the stake president, a wonderful man, had arranged for me
to interview some members of the Church who had not participated in Church activity for a
number of years.  </p>
<p>While I was waiting for one man to visit with me, I decided I would take my Book of Mormon
and just let the pages fall open.  Maybe you have done that.  Let it fall open where it may and
read the opened pages to see if there is a timely message there for you.  </p>
<p>My book fell open to Mosiah 27.  I prayerfully wondered if there was a message in this chapter
which might apply to the young man I was about to interview.  I read to myself verse 14 of
Chapter 27.  Here is how it reads:</p>
<p> <em>And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and
also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith
concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore,
for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the
prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith.</em></p>
<p>What a marvelous demonstration of the power of faith-filled prayers uttered in behalf of others,
in this case, in behalf of Alma the Younger, by his father, Alma.  I wondered, "Will this apply to
the brother I am about to meet?"</p>
<p>A young man entered the room.  To my surprise, he was not Japanese, but was from another
country.  We will call him Kevin.  He had served a mission in Japan, and, after returning home,
had then returned to Japan to marry a recent convert.  She was, as yet, shallow in the faith, and
they had been out of mainstream church activity for about five years.</p>
<p>I said to him, "Kevin, you are a pretty brave guy."  He responded, "Why do you say that?"  </p>
<p>"Well, to come here to meet with a general authority can be an intimidating thing.  How did you
get the courage to come?"</p>
<p>"I just knew that I had to," was his sincere response.</p>
<p>I then told him that prior to meeting with him I had been praying and had opened the scriptures at
random, and that my eyes fell on Mosiah 27:14.  I requested that we read it to see if it had
anything to do with our being together that day.  We recalled Nephi's counsel that when we read
the scriptures, we should liken them unto ourselves that we may have hope.(1 Nephi 19:23-24)</p>
<p>One way to liken a scripture to yourself is to put your name into that scripture as you read it.  So
we started out by paraphrasing Mosiah 27:14 in this manner.</p>
<p> <em>And again, the angel said: </em>[I then indicated that I guessed that I was the angel, not much
to look at but the only one available.]  So we started over.  <em>And again Elder Brown said,
the Lord has heard the prayers of his people, </em>[Kevin], <em>and also the prayers of his servant
. . . who is thy father, </em>[Kevin]; <em>for he </em>[your father] <em> has prayed with</em> <em>much</em> <em>faith oncerning
thee that thou </em>[Kevin]<em> mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth</em>; <em>therefore, for
this purpose have I</em> [Elder Brown] <em>come to convince thee </em>[Kevin]<em> of the power and
authority of God, that the prayers of his servants </em>[your father and mother]<em> might be
answered according to their faith</em> (Mosiah 27:14, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Suddenly, that scripture had become very personal for Kevin. Then, I said to him,  "Kevin, your
father prayed you here today, didn't he?"  He responded with some emotion, "I'm sure he did."</p>
<p>"Is your father active in the Church?"  </p>
<p>"Oh, yes," he responded.  "In fact, he and my mother are filling a temple mission right now."  I
gave him a blessing.  It was a special moment, a moment in which the Lord had answered the
fervent prayers of a father and mother, and also the prayer of one of his servants who happened to
be in a position to help to answer those prayers that day. </p>
<p>Your prayers make a big difference, Brothers and Sisters.  Petition your God for your needs. 
Plead with Him in faith to bless others for whom you have deep anxieties.  Ask Him to lighten
your heavy heart.  Plead for help, in math, even!</p>
<p><strong><u>Pray always unto the Father in My Name</u></strong></p>
<p>I conclude with what is the most important doctrine related to powerful prayer that I know.  I
illustrate with another account from Asia.</p>
<p>President Darryl Harris, Seoul Mission President, and I had just concluded a fireside for
investigators in the Seoul Stake Center.  Following the meeting, two sister missionaries came up
to introduce themselves, one, a Korean sister, and the other, Sister Kristi K. Fielding.  They were
delightful, full of sparkle, as most lady missionaries tend to be.  Following our conversation, they
exited, hurrying back to their apartment before the "witching hour" of 9:30 p.m.  You returned
missionaries know what I mean.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, an Elder came running into the chapel to tell us that something had
happened to Sister Fielding.  We hurried outside only to find her screaming, her body jerking in
strange gyrations.  When she saw us, she screamed at us.  She wanted nothing to do with us. 
This was not the same Sister we had just been speaking with.</p>
<p>President Harris and I decided to try to get her into the mission van.  She resisted.  Finally, we
were able to force her into the van, but she crawled down into the space between the back seats
with her back toward us.  We determined that we would attempt to give her a blessing.  For what
followed, I read from a letter Sister Fielding wrote to me on March 21, 1998.  </p>
<p> <em>I would like to write a letter of thanks for the blessing you gave me on Friday, March 20. 
It's hard to describe the feeling that was inside me, but it was almost identical to the
feeling of Joseph Smith when he went to the grove to pray.</em></p>
<p>Then she quoted from Joseph Smith's account in Joseph Smith-History 1:15, one with which you
are all familiar:</p>
<p> <em>"I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an
astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick
darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to
sudden destruction." (Joseph Smith History 1:15)</em></p>
<p>She, then, writes:</p>
<p><em>	I don't remember much of your blessing, but I remember you saying, "<u>In the name of
Jesus Christ</u>."  The minute I heard that name, everything went calm.  I felt at peace- I felt
the light come back . . . I love my Savior, Jesus Christ.  I'm grateful for his atonement . .
.This gospel is <u>so</u> true.  I love it!  Love Always, Sister Kristi K. Fielding</em></p>
<p>The Lord has said, in fact He has commanded, as recorded in Moses 5:8:</p>
<p> <em>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest <u>in the name of the Son</u>, and thou shalt repent
and call upon God <u>in the name of the Son</u> forevermore. (Moses 5:8)</em></p>
<p>As you use this sacred, wonderful name, <u>the name of our beloved Savior</u>, when you pray,  you
connect with the powers of heaven.  The next time you pray, really pray in his holy name, <u>in the
name of Jesus Christ</u>.  As you purposely and sincerely use that Name, you will feel something, a
witness that someone is listening, that you are praying with power, that this prayer will reach its
destination.  You will feel the warmth of His love.  </p>
<p><strong><u>An Experience in Brigham City, Utah</u></strong></p>
<p>We began our seminary teaching career in Brigham City, Utah.  Another couple, Arvil and Karen
Hemenway, were beginning there as well.  Karen told us of an experience they had had with their
daughter, Kim.  Kim had just learned how to count to ten.  You know how parents are.  They
were so proud that they called grandma on the telephone so that Kim could demonstrate her
newly acquired counting skills. Little Kim asked grandma, </p>
<p>"Grandma, would you like me to count to ten for you?"  Of course grandma said yes.  So Kimmie
began to count, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten . . . in the name of Jesus
Christ, Amen." </p>
<p>As Latter-day Saints, we use this <u>sacred name of Jesus Christ</u> often.  Be careful.  You are on holy
ground when you use it.  One of the Ten Commandments uttered to Moses and all of Israel from
Mt. Sinai was, </p>
<p> <em>"Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD, thy God, in vain; for the LORD will not hold
him guiltless that taketh his name in vain." </em>(Exodus 20:7)</p>
<p>Properly used in prayer, this special name becomes a passport to heaven.  Do not thoughtlessly
and repetitiously use it just as a means to get out of a talk, a testimony, or a prayer.  It may well
be the very most important part of your prayer. I wish I had more time to discuss this with you. 
Ponder the principle.  Study it.  Really pray, teach, and testify <u>in His holy name.</u> </p>
<p>If you are deeply concerned about your mother's health at this time, pray for her <u>in the name of
Jesus Christ</u>.  If your little brother is struggling to find a testimony, does not want to serve a
mission, or is heading a direction spiritually that deeply worries you, pray for him <u>in the name of
Jesus Christ</u>.  You priesthood holders, the next time you have the opportunity to administer to
someone, really do it <u>in the name of Jesus Christ</u>.  Some of you are right now have heavy hearts. 
You are hurting.  Plead for help <u>in the name of Jesus Christ</u>.  Power will come, the heavens will
open, the Father will hear, and the powers of heaven will be activated in your behalf.  </p>
<p><strong><u>Testimony</u></strong></p>
<p>I thank our Lord for this powerful means of communication-prayer, offered <u>in the name of His
Son!</u>  I know He hears.  I know He answers prayers for He has answered mine on more occasions
than I can even remember.  I know that His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, is our Savior and
Redeemer.  I witness that to you <u>in the sacred name of Jesus Christ</u>, Amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">What a privilege to be with you today.  I have long admired President Bednar and the work he is
leading at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho to enhance education.  To our friends from EDS we extend a heart felt
thanks for your support of the innovation occurring here.  I am quite confident that your
investment will be well rewarded.  What a remarkable place and a remarkable time.</p>
<p>As you well know, any time spent with President and Sister Bednar is edifying.  They have been
gracious hosts to Lyn and to me and we are grateful for the time we have been able to spend with
them.</p>
<p>I am mindful of the standard that has been set for speaking at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho.  Some weeks ago
while walking on my treadmill in the morning I saw Sister Bednar speaking of selling our
birthright while holding a can of soup and a bagel.  I was edified by her instruction.  I ask for
your prayers that these next few minutes will be edifying as well.</p>
<p>When 17 years old I somehow convinced my parents to take me to the trailhead of the Pacific
Crest Trail on the border of California and Mexico where I intended to walk alone to Canada. 
The story of my hairdo is for another day.  While the trip itself may appear amazing, what is
more amazing for this father of four sons is the fact that I somehow convinced my parents to let
me do it.  I consider it to be my greatest feat of salesmanship second only to convincing my wife
Lyn to marry me.  Even though I did not complete the entire trail and eventually had to stop at
the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon, I did learn some valuable lessons that
have helped me throughout my journeys in life.</p>
<p>During my hike I developed an expertise in the use of a map and compass and in discerning
landmarks along the way.  There were times when these skills were critical to my safety and
progress.  My map served to help me identify the course to travel while my compass served to
establish position and direction.  Fortunately a few trail markers were provided at times along the
way thereby confirming what I had derived from my map and compass.  Even more helpful were
times when I was able to speak with someone who had already walked the trail ahead.  Often
their advice would help me better use my map, compass, or the trail markers along my journey.</p>
<p>In our journey to come unto Christ I have learned that maps, compasses and trail markers take
various forms, which, when understood, can help us along our way.  I have been particularly
blessed by the advice of wonderful parents and priesthood leaders who have provided timely
advice and counsel.  Whenever I have followed their counsel I have progressed in my journey.</p>
<p>Maps can never be detailed enough to guide every footstep, nor can a compass be accurate
enough to always reveal the exact position.  Fortunately, trail markers appear at times to confirm
what we attempt to discern from maps and compasses.  However, without the aid of map and
compass it is often difficult to discern the meaning of a trail marker.  Together, in the hands of
someone trained in their use, they become incredibly valuable.  I intend to speak of spiritual
maps, compasses, and trail markers today to provide some insight regarding our position and
direction as we journey to come unto Christ.  Consider this one of those moments when you meet
someone who has walked some of the trail ahead and is offering some advice.</p>
<p>A truly meaningful discussion of coming unto Christ cannot begin without recognition of the
central role of the power of the atonement.  You and I have been richly blessed by President
Bednar's eloquent teachings of the power of the atonement and of the central role the atonement
plays in our efforts to grow from bad to good to better.  Last year at that other BYU campus
south of here President Bednar shared his insights regarding the power of the atonement with the
campus community.  His teachings penetrated my soul and have served as a catalyst for my
thoughts that I intend to share today.  My purpose now is to simply stress the significance of the
atonement as it relates to coming unto Christ and to encourage you to review President Bednar's
teachings on the power of the Atonement.</p>
<p>This past summer I had the opportunity of vacationing with my family to Southern Utah and
Northern Arizona, which included visits to Zion's National Park and The Grand Canyon.  During
our travels we came upon The Navajo Bridges that cross the Colorado River near Page, Arizona. 
As you can see the Colorado River has cut a deep gorge through which it travels on its way to the
Grand Canyon.  In a remarkable feat of engineering, a bridge was constructed several years ago
to cross this great chasm.  Originally designed for a single lane of automobile traffic, it now
serves as a footbridge with a newer and wider bridge having been built for vehicles.  In awe, my
family and I walked across what is now the footbridge gazing at the water hundreds of feet
below.</p>
<p>As I have reflected on the experience of walking across the bridge connecting the sides of this
deep canyon I have recognized the blessing of the bridge.  Prior to the bridge it would have been
impossible for any human to cross the canyon alone, let alone with some kind of cargo.  With the
bridge in place I was able to cross with relatively little effort being the benefactor of more energy
and effort than I could have ever exercised on my own.  While I was indeed crossing the great
chasm on my own power putting one foot in front of the other, my effort was made effective only
by the enormous contribution of others who had provided the bridge.  Without their effort, no
amount of effort on my part would have resulted in my crossing the canyon.</p>
<p>In a wonderful way, Christ has provided a bridge for us to cross over the everlasting gulf of
misery and land our souls at the right hand of God (Helaman 3:27-30).  Brothers and sisters, we
would be seriously mistaken if we were to conclude that any effort on our part to come unto
Christ is in any way comparable to the contribution of the Savior's atonement.  Not recognizing
Christ's contribution would be akin to my thinking that I had crossed the great chasm near Page,
Arizona because of my own efforts, not recognizing how futile it would be to truly try and do it
without the aid of those who constructed the bridge.  Surely, it is by grace that we are saved, after
all we can do (2 Nephi 25:23).  At the same time, it would sad to have such a bridge in place and
then try to cross the canyon without it.  So how do we take advantage of this great gift of the
atonement as we journey toward Christ?</p>
<p><strong>Desire to Live By Faith</strong></p>
<p>While our own efforts are nearly immeasurable when compared with the contribution of the
atonement, there is no substitute for our individual effort.  We must do all <em>we</em> can before Christ
can do all <em>He</em> can to save us through His atonement.  The atonement is the outcome of Christ
subjecting his desire to that of the Father in the most selfless exercise of agency in the history of
mankind.  Unsurprisingly, we must exercise our agency appropriately to take advantage of the
atonement.  One of the most basic ways by which we can exercise our agency is in determining
what we desire.  Alma declares that the seed of faith is the simple desire to believe (Alma 32:27). 
True desire is not theatre or weekend work.  For our efforts to come unto Christ to be effective
they must be sincere and sustained.  We must desire to live a life of faith with all our heart,
might, mind and strength (Moroni 10:32), at all times and in all places (Mosiah 18: 9).  We
cannot be actors or weekend warriors.  We must full-time Christian soldiers.</p>
<p>	Elder Maxwell has taught that, "<em>Desire</em> denotes a real longing or craving. Hence righteous
desires are much more than passive preferences or fleeting feelings. Of course our genes,
circumstances, and environments matter very much, and they shape us significantly. Yet
there remains an inner zone in which we are sovereign, unless we abdicate. In this zone
lies the essence of our individuality and our personal accountability."   While concluding
his discourse he added this precious pearl, "Brothers and sisters, a loving God will work
with us, but the initiating particle of desire which ignites the spark of resolve must be our
own!"  (According to Our Desires, Maxwell, <em>Ensign</em>, November, 1996).  </p>
<p>The sincerity and sustainability of our desires will be enhanced as we connect them to the
atonement.  The atonement makes possible the fulfillment of our righteous desires to live lives of
faith.  Unless our desires recognize the role of the atonement and seek for its blessings it will
matter little what we desire as it will have no lasting effect.  As Mormon explained to his son
Moroni, all things not linked to the most charitable act of the atonement must fail
(Moroni 7:46).</p>
<p><strong>Search For And Receive Truth</strong></p>
<p>The desire to live by faith is subsequently manifest in the disciple searching for truth, for faith is
born of knowing and living truth.  There is no salvation in believing falsehood, no matter how
sincere our belief (see 2 Timothy 2:18 and Helaman 15:7).  Without truth we cannot develop
saving faith (Alma 32:21 and <em>Lectures on Faith</em> 3:2-5).</p>
<p>The true disciple has a very expansive view of truth seeing it as a great whole encompassing vast
realms of knowledge.  In academe we labor a great deal to divide knowledge into separate little
compartments, instead of connecting truth into one great whole.  Departmental and college
boundaries too often serve to separate and divide truth rather than integrate and unify it.  
Unfortunately, we latter-day disciples too often fall prey to this divisive philosophy of man
leaving us to argue over which academic discipline is most important or most true.  We, of all
people, should be looking beyond such taxonomical arguments and instead be unifying all truth
into one great whole.  Remember, "intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth
wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light (Doctrine and
Covenants 88:40).  </p>
<p>We should also demonstrate our appreciation of the opportunity to learn by being anxiously
engaged in learning throughout our entire lives and not just for a brief period while enrolled in
formal programs of study.  Furthermore, our quest to seek for and receive truth should not be
confused with the semester ending ritual of preparing for final exams.  Prior to these events there
is a great cramming of facts and figures into our cerebral spheres only to see this mass of
knowledge expunged within minutes.  This ritual too often leaves the cranium largely void of
whatever it had contained just moments before being replaced only by a headache or fatigue. 
The final judgment, brothers and sisters, is not a multiple-choice exam for which we can cram in
the final hours and during which we will simply spew forth various scriptures or spiritual
thoughts.  The final judgment is the ultimate true/false exam during which we will stand before
the Embodiment Of Truth and will be judged as to whether we are either true or false.  For this
judgment to be successful we must receive the truth into our souls, not simply store it as we
would any other fact or figure in scripture margins, a binder, day planner, or even Palm Pilot.</p>
<p>Central to our quest for truth should be an understanding of the atonement and its application in
our daily life.  The atonement serves to hold together all truth as it is the greatest of all truths. 
We may learn a great deal in life, but until we connect every truth the ultimate truth of the
atonement we have no way of unifying all truth into one great whole.</p>
<p><strong>Repent of All Sin</strong></p>
<p>When we sincerely receive the truth into our souls we begin to notice that aspects of our
thoughts, actions, or words are not aligned with the truth of God's thoughts, actions, or words. 
The ultimate test of whether we are receiving truth is whether it results in falsehoods being
expelled from our thoughts, actions, and words.  This does not happen at once, as we will discuss
a little later.  This process of change can result in soul wrenching changes that leave us
exhausted.  In the end, however, there is nothing to compare with the energy resulting from the
miracle of forgiveness as the Spirit whispers to our souls, as it did to Enos, "Thy sins are forgiven
thee and thou shalt be blessed" (Enos 1:10).  </p>
<p>We cannot modify behavior alone in this process--that would be theatre.  Our very nature must
be changed as we discover both large and small sins.  True repentance encompasses our thoughts,
actions, and words; otherwise we would be hypocrites because of inconsistencies across our
thoughts, words, and actions.  This should occupy our time and attention each and every day. 
Furthermore, repentance should be part of every aspect of our lives, not just what would be
considered religious.  It is a fascinating thing to me that we as a people who have as a centerpiece
of our theology the doctrine of change can struggle so with change in our work-a-day lives.  We
struggle so very much when confronted with the need to change at work due to changes in who is
being served, the services being provided, how performance is being measured, how work is
performed, the development of a new technology, or how people are organized.  On Sunday,
brothers and sisters, we call it repentance.  The doctrine applies to all aspects of our lives and not
just overcoming gross sin.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that any effort on our part to repent without recognizing the atonement is
as shallow as it is sad.  There is no reason to even attempt repentance without recognizing that
the atonement makes repentance possible.  It would be equally sad if the atonement were wasted
by our not repenting.  Remember, if we do not repent we must suffer even as the Savior
(Doctrine and Covenants 19:15-19).</p>
<p><strong>Make, Renew and Keep Sacred Covenants</strong></p>
<p>When sincere, repentance leads to the making, renewing and keeping of sacred covenants. 
Whether associated with ordinances of salvation found in the waters of baptism or within the
walls of the Holy Temple, or those we make privately with our God, faith-building covenants are
specific declarations of how we will follow Christ.  We are provided the opportunity to renew
such covenants either as part of our Sabbath Day worship or in the Holy Temple in behalf of the
dead.  These are sacred opportunities to remember what we have declared before God, angels,
and witnesses.</p>
<p>The need for renewing covenants grows primarily from the fact that we disciples have short
memory and attention spans.  The Book of Mormon is replete with accounts of people forgetting. 
The opportunity to renew covenants helps us remember that which we have promised.  When our
covenant renewing is frequent and sincere our covenant keeping is more likely.</p>
<p>No matter how sincere our covenant making and renewing, unless we are keeping our covenants
they provide no benefit.  We cannot call on the Lord and not do what we say we will and expect
the Lord's blessing (see Luke 6:46).  We must make and renew and keep saving covenants with
all our heart, might, mind, and strength until the very end and beyond.</p>
<p>Once again, without the atonement, our efforts to make, renew and keep sacred covenants are
shallow and lifeless.  They would be nothing more than hollow rituals.  While making, renewing,
and keeping sacred covenants we will be strengthened as we consider the depth of the Savior's
covenant making and keeping.  He not only descended from a throne, but he descended below all
things (Doctrine and Covenants 88:6).  The depth of his covenant making and keeping is our
standard.  Inherent in this process will be suffering, but nowhere near the degree Christ
experienced.  Since Christ learned by what he suffered (see Hebrews 5:8 and Doctrine and
Covenants 105:5-6), should we expect anything different for ourselves?  We should not waste
our days complaining about this reality in any degree.  As Elder Maxwell has taught, "since the
most innocent suffered the most, our cries of why cannot match his, but we can utter the same
submissive word nevertheless" (Neal A. Maxwell, "Swallowed Up in the Will of the Father,"
<em>Ensign</em>, November, 1995).</p>
<p><strong>Receive the Witness and Companionship of the Spirit</strong></p>
<p>When we are sincere in our covenant making and renewing we receive the witness of the Spirit. 
When we are persistent in our covenant keeping we receive the constant companionship of the
Spirit.  The witness and companionship of the Holy Spirit is actually the ratification that our
covenant making, renewing, and keeping is accepted of God (see Doctrine and Covenants 132:7). 
It is the means by which we know we are accepted of God.  It is no coincidence that we are
instructed to receive the Spirit early on in our covenant making, and that every week in our
covenant renewing at the sacrament table we pray to receive God's Spirit.</p>
<p>The witness and companionship of the Spirit is made possible by the atonement.  The mercy and
power provided by the atonement makes it possible for the Spirit to abide as we are cleansed
from sin.  Without the atonement we would be left to walk this life without God's merciful
provision of the light that fills the immensity of space and is in all things, giving life to all things,
being the law by which all things are governed (Doctrine and Covenants 88:6-13).</p>
<p><strong>Help Build Others' Faith</strong></p>
<p>The scriptures are filled with accounts of those who have received the witness and
companionship of the Spirit and are then led to forget themselves and instead worry about the
faith of others.  Enos, Paul, Joseph, the sons of Mosiah, Alma and many others all stand as
testimonies of this truth.  Remember the description of Alma and the sons of Mosiah after they
had received the truth, repented of their sins, made sacred covenants, and received the Holy
Spirit?  "They could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thought that
any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble"  (Mosiah 28:3). 
Whether anxiously engaged in a good cause of our own free will and choice (Doctrine and
Covenants 58: 27) or called to serve by prophecy, the Spirit compels us to help build others'
faith.</p>
<p>The greatest help we can be to others is helping them recognize and accept the atonement of
Christ.  The atonement is the greatest help possible to build mankind's faith.  Without it there
would be no faith and any effort on our part to build others' faith would be futile.  Among the
ways by which this service is rendered is through faithful and sincere home and visiting teaching,
what President Benson described as "one of the tests of true discipleship" (Ezra Taft Benson, "To
The Home Teachers of The Church," <em>Ensign</em>, May, 1987).</p>
<p><strong>One Eternal Round</strong></p>
<p>Sustained effort to build others' faith naturally results in our own desires for faith increasing. 
Our joy is increased when we help others find the same joy.  The Savior himself demonstrated
this joy when he ministered to the Nephites following his resurrection (3 Nephi 27:30).</p>
<p>The increased desire elevates our efforts as though we are climbing a spiral staircase that has six
basic steps.  Over and over we are carried to a higher plane by the same basic steps.  How can we
ever become board with such an effort.</p>
<p>As we continue our climb we should not be surprised to find the angle of our climb increasing. 
Early on, God mercifully seems to provide a gentle incline in our climb.  While there may be
some major obstacles, they are easily recognized and averted.  However, as our climb continues
and we grow from grace to grace, the degree of difficulty often increases.  What might be
mistakenly considered minor sins are seen as major stumbling stones, not gravel along the
roadside.  We mourn over a moment of unkindness while not even considering murder.  While
clearly murder would be vastly more serious than unkindness, because we have long since passed
that stumbling stone on the path of discipleship, murder is not even recognized as an option. 
Therefore, our focus turns to what might be considered by the lesser disciple the lesser sins, but
for the greater disciples these lesser things become much more significant. Unkindness and many
other characteristics and attributes become a major concern, not unfortunate personality traits we
simply have to endure because that is the way we are.</p>
<p><strong>Failing Faith</strong></p>
<p>In reverse the aforementioned steps suggests ways by which our faith weakens and fails.  When
we turn from the building of others' faith and look inward it is likely the result of our not having
received the Spirit, for one of the fruits of receiving the Spirit is that we turn outward (Enos 1:8-11).  Not enjoying the witness and the constant companionship of the Spirit is evidence that
covenants are not being made, renewed or kept.  If covenants are not being made, renewed or
kept then it is likely we are not repenting.  If not repenting, we are not likely searching for and
receiving truth.  Not searching for and receiving truth is evidence that we do not desire to live by
faith.  In the end, our desires dictate our direction and pace (see Neal A. Maxwell, "According to
the Desire of Our Hearts," <em>Ensign</em>, November, 1996).  Sadly, not even the atonement can help
when we exercise our agency in such ways.  In the end, we are left with our desires.</p>
<p><strong>Determining Our Position and Direction</strong></p>
<p>All of us are eager to know our position and direction in any journey.  Whether the child asking
over and over, "are we there yet," or the adult deeply pondering the question "Can ye feel so
now?," (see Alma 5:26) we all want to know the truth of our situation.</p>
<p>During the hike I referred to at the beginning of this talk, and through many other journeys
throughout my life I have come to appreciate the importance of knowing my position and
direction in my journeys.  On my hike when trail markers were not found I would regularly use a
compass and a method called triangulation to determine my position and direction.  The model
we have discussed has a notion of triangulation in it as well as serving as it were like a compass
identifying our position relative to clear landmarks.</p>
<p>Let me identify some important landmarks we should be looking for in our journey.  I will
present them in the form of questions:</p>
<p>	First, are we seeking for and receiving all truth?<br />
	Second, are we making, renewing and keeping sacred covenants?<br />
	Third, are we anxiously engaged in helping build others' faith?</p>
<p>Let me emphasize the first of these three questions.  I understand that there is a tradition at BYU-Idaho to carry your scriptures to devotionals.  Do you have yours?  Something I have come to
worry about with those for whom I have stewardship is the practice of daily feasting upon God's
word.  Of all that we might do to seek for and receive all truth the importance of the practice of
daily feasting upon the word cannot be overstated.  I grow increasingly concerned when I speak
to others who have allowed the pressures of the day to push aside time for daily feasting. 
Brothers and sisters, I know something of pressure and demands upon time.  Throughout my life
I have somehow managed to keep rather busy.  However, I have had the practice of making time
each day for a study of the scriptures since I was 16.  For nearly 30 years now I have been blessed
to feast upon God's word and to be taught by His Holy Spirit.  During this time the Lord has
favored me with some degree of success and increased responsibility.  I am convinced that I
would not have been nearly as successful in life without the practice of daily feasting firmly
established.  I commend such a practice to each of you at this early stage in your life and suggest
repentance may be needed if it is not firmly established.  No honor of men, including a diploma,
can match the value of the habit of daily feasting upon God's word.</p>
<p>When we are able to answer each of these three questions honestly in the affirmative we can be
assured we are firmly positioned on the path leading to Christ and our direction is correct.  When
even one of these questions is answered with something less than an honest yes we can assume
that we are either slipping backwards or not on the path at all.  If not corrected, over time, we can
find ourselves completely off the path and wandering in strange roads.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In summary, without the atonement we would make no measurable progress in our efforts to
come unto Christ.  If we purposely limit the degree to which we are engaged in any one of these
activities, we limit our progress in coming unto Christ.  Furthermore, there is a dependency
among the various activities.  For example, focusing on repenting without actively searching for
the truth can result in our aligning ourselves with erroneous doctrines.  Erroneous doctrines
cannot enable saving faith nor do they lead us to saving covenants and the attendant gifts of the
Spirit when we keep our covenants.  Conversely, if our discovery of truth does not penetrate our
souls, thereby leading us to repentance, we will be forever learning yet never able to know the
truth (2 Timothy 3:7).  Over time, each of these activities must shape all that we do, say, and
think (Alma 12:14).  By our thoughts, actions, and words we demonstrate we are overcoming the
natural man and becoming a saint through the atonement of Christ (Mosiah 3:19).</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we are having trouble fully keeping a covenant, it is often the lack of
repenting in our life.  For example, if we are tempted to dissolve a marriage covenant, it is often
the result of the lack of repentance in the relationship.  When we find ourselves in our marriage
relationship attempting to justify ourselves with the expression, "this is just the way I am, take it
or leave it," we have missed the whole point of the marriage covenant.  The covenant is a
commitment to change and become more Christlike.  For me my marriage has served as a
marvelous catalyst for change.  Over the past 23 years my thoughts, actions, and words have been
refined and changed to the point that I am a fundamentally different person than I was 23 years
ago.  I pay tribute to my wife for her kind and gentle tutoring through which the Lord has often
taught me plain and precious truths.  The secret in a successful covenant marriage is not in two
people finding each other, it is in two people finding Christ together.  He makes you one.</p>
<p>While a personal and private process, our progress is supported through family and Church
efforts.  The ordering of support is important--family first, then the Church.  When this ordering
is compromised, the quality or pace of our progress is often compromised.  While potentially
compensating for familial deficiencies, the Church is no replacement for the family.  As Elder
Maxwell explains, the Church is scaffolding around the more permanent structure of the family
(see "Unto the Rising Generation," <em>Ensign</em>, April, 1985).  The purpose of the Church is to invite
and help the children of God to come unto Christ (Doctrine and Covenants 20:59).  The primary
instrumentality for doing so is the family unit.</p>
<p>Hopefully these thoughts will encourage you to go to your homes and ponder upon these things,
asking God to prepare your minds for further instruction as you come unto Christ.</p>
<p>All that is left now for me to do is to testify of the truth of these things.  While recognizing the
feeble nature of my attempt to teach and testify, I stand as a witness of one who is the beneficiary
of God's love manifest through the atonement of His Son.  </p>
<p>	I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,<br />
	Confused by the grace that so fully he proffers me,<br />
	I tremble to know that for me he was crucified,<br />
	That for me a sinner, he suffered, he bled, and died,<br />
	Oh it is wonderful that he should care for me enough to die for me!<br />
	Oh it is wonderful, wonderful to me!<br />
	(<em>Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em>, 193)</p>
<p>I testify that as we persistently desire to live by faith; seek for and receive truth; repent; make,
renew and keep sacred covenants; as we receive the witness and companionship of the Spirit and
seek to build others' faith we can come unto Christ.  Doing so is not easy or quick, but it is
fulfilling and sustaining.  I express my gratitude to God for his mercy and love as I have
attempted, often in feeble ways, to seek after him.  When sincere, he always responds to my
efforts and lifts me.</p>
<p>Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><strong><em>"THE CHARACTER OF CHRIST"</em></strong><em></em></p>
<p align="CENTER"><strong></strong><strong>Brigham Young University-Idaho Religion Symposium<br />

Elder David A. Bednar</strong></p>
<p>Last September I participated in an area training meeting in Twin Falls, Idaho.  Elder Neal A.
Maxwell presided at the training session, and on a Friday night and a Saturday morning he, the
Idaho Area Presidency, and other general church officers instructed a group of approximately one
hundred stake presidents.  It was a meaningful and memorable time of spiritual enrichment,
learning, and edification.</p>
<p>During the course of his teaching and testifying, Elder Maxwell made a statement that impressed
me deeply and has been the recent focus for much of my studying, reflecting, and pondering.  He
said, "There would have been no Atonement except for the character of Christ." Since hearing
this straightforward and penetrating statement, I have tried to learn more about and better
understand the word "character."  I have also pondered the relationship between Christ's
character and the Atonement--and the implications of that relationship for each of us as disciples. 
This morning I hope to share with you just a few of the learnings that have come to my mind and
heart as I have attempted to more fully appreciate this teaching by Elder Maxwell.</p>
<p><strong>What is Character?</strong></p>
<p>After returning home from the area training meeting in Twin Falls, the first question I attempted
to answer was "What is character?"  The <u>Oxford English Dictionary</u> indicates that many of the
uses of the word character relate to graphic symbols, printing, engraving, and writing.  The
usages I found most relevant, however, relate to ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the sum of the moral and mental qualities
which distinguish an individual or a race; mental or moral constitution; moral qualities strongly
developed or strikingly displayed" (<u>Oxford English Dictionary</u> Online, University Press 2003,
Second Edition, 1989).  Interestingly, when we look up the word "character" in the topical guide
of our scriptures, we discover that it is cross-referenced to the topics of honesty, honor, and
integrity. </p>
<p>Brigham Young emphasized the significance of the Savior's character as he taught and testified
about the truthfulness of the Holy Bible:</p>
<p>	. . . the Bible is true.  It may not all have been translated aright, and many precious
things may have been rejected in the compilation and translation of the Bible; but
we understand, from the writings of one of the Apostles, that if all the sayings and
doings of the Savior had been written, the world could not contain them.  I will
say that the world could not understand them.  They do not understand what we
have on record, <strong>nor the character of the Savior,</strong> as delineated in the Scriptures;
and yet it is one of the simplest things in the world, and the Bible, when it is
understood, is one of the simplest books in the world, for, as far as it is translated
correctly, it is nothing but truth, and in truth there is no mystery save to the
ignorant.  The revelations of the Lord to his creatures are adapted to the lowest
capacity, and they bring life and salvation to all who are willing to receive them. 
(<u>Discourses of Brigham Young</u>, p. 124, emphasis added)</p>
<p>Brigham Young further taught that faith must be focused upon Jesus' character, in His
Atonement, and in the Father's plan of salvation:</p>
<p>	.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I will take the liberty of saying to every man and woman who wishes to obtain
salvation through him (the Savior) that <em>looking</em> to him, only, is not enough: <strong>they
must have faith in his name, character and atonement</strong>; and they must have
faith in his father and in the plan of salvation devised and wrought out by the
Father and the Son.  What will this faith lead to?  It will lead to obedience to the
requirements of the Gospel; and the few words that I may deliver to my brethren
and sisters and friends this afternoon will be with the direct view of leading them
to God.  (<u>Journal of Discourses</u>, Vol.13, p. 56, Brigham Young, July&nbsp;18, 1869,
emphasis added)</p>
<p><strong>The Character of the Lord Jesus Christ</strong></p>
<p>In a message entitled "O How Great the Plan of Our God" delivered to CES religious educators
in February of 1995 (p. 5), Elder Maxwell specifically linked Christ's character to the infinite
and eternal atoning sacrifice:</p>
<p>	Jesus' character necessarily underwrote His remarkable atonement.  Without
Jesus' sublime character there could have been no sublime atonement!  His
character is such that He "[suffered] temptations of every kind" (Alma 7:11), yet
He gave temptations "no heed" (Doctrine and Covenants 20:22).</p>
<p>	Someone has said only those who resist temptation really understand the power of
temptation.  Because Jesus resisted it perfectly, He understood temptation
perfectly, hence He can help us.  The fact that He was dismissive of temptation
and gave it "no heed," reveals His marvelous character, which we are to emulate
(see Doctrine and Covenants 20:22; 3 Nephi 12:48; 27:27).</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest indicator of character is the capacity to recognize and appropriately respond
to other people who are experiencing the very challenge or adversity that is most immediately
and forcefully pressing upon us.  Character is revealed, for example, in the power to discern the
suffering of other people when we ourselves are suffering; in the ability to detect the hunger of
others when we are hungry; and in the power to reach out and extend compassion for the spiritual
agony of others when we are in the midst of our own spiritual distress.  Thus, character is
demonstrated by looking and reaching outward when the natural and instinctive response is to be
self-absorbed and turn inward.  If such a capacity is indeed the ultimate criterion of moral
character, then the Savior of the world is the perfect example of such a consistent and charitable
character.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Christ's Character in the New Testament </strong></p>
<p>The New Testament is replete with "strikingly displayed" examples of the Savior's character. 
We are all well aware that following His baptism by John the Baptist and as a preparation for His
public ministry, the Savior fasted for forty days.  He also was tempted by the adversary to
inappropriately use His supernal power to satisfy physical desires by commanding that stones be
made bread, to gain recognition by casting Himself down from the pinnacle of the temple, and to
obtain wealth and power and prestige in exchange for falling down and worshiping the tempter
(see Matthew 4:1-9).  It is interesting to note that the overarching and fundamental challenge to
the Savior in each of these three temptations is contained in the taunting statement, "<strong><em>If thou be
the Son of God</em></strong>."  Satan's strategy, in essence, was to dare the Son of God to improperly
demonstrate His God-given powers, to sacrifice meekness and modesty, and, thereby, betray who
He was.  Thus, Satan attempted repeatedly to attack Jesus' understanding of who He was and of
His relationship with His Father.  Jesus was victorious in meeting and overcoming the strategy of
Satan.</p>
<p>I suspect the Savior may have been at least partially spent physically after forty days of
fasting--and somewhat spiritually drained after His encounter with the adversary.  With this
background information in mind, please turn with me now to Matthew&nbsp;4, and together we will
read verse 11: "Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him."</p>
<p>This verse in the King James version of the New Testament clearly indicates that angels came
and ministered to the Savior after the devil had departed.  And, undoubtedly, Jesus would have
benefitted from and been blessed by such a heavenly ministration in a time of physical and
spiritual need.</p>
<p>However, the Joseph Smith Translation of Matthew 4:11 provides a remarkable insight into the
character of Christ.  Please note the important differences in verse 11 between the King James
version and the Joseph Smith Translation: "Then the devil leaveth him, and, now Jesus knew that
John was cast into prison, and he sent angels, and, behold, they came and ministered unto him
(John)."</p>
<p>Interestingly, the additions found in the JST completely change our understanding of this event. 
Angels did not come and minister to the Savior; rather, the Savior, in His own state of spiritual,
mental, and physical distress, sent angels to minister to John.  Brothers and sisters, it is important
for us to recognize that Jesus in the midst of His own challenge recognized and appropriately
responded to John--who was experiencing a similar but lesser challenge than that of the Savior's. 
Thus, the character of Christ is manifested as He reached outward and ministered to one who was
suffering--even as He himself was experiencing anguish and torment.</p>
<p>In the upper room on the night of the last supper, the very night during which He would
experience the greatest suffering that ever took place in all of the worlds created by Him, Christ
spoke about the Comforter and peace:</p>
<p>	These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.</p>
<p>	But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you.</p>
<p>	Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I
unto you.  Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. (John&nbsp;14:25-27)</p>
<p>Once again the fundamental character of Christ is revealed magnificently in this tender incident. 
Recognizing that He himself was about to intensely and personally experience the absence of
both comfort and peace, and in a moment when His heart was perhaps troubled and afraid, the
Master reached outward and offered to others the very blessings that could and would have
strengthened Him.</p>
<p>In the great intercessory prayer, offered immediately before Jesus went forth with His disciples
over the brook Cedron to the Garden of Gethsemane, the Master prayed for His disciples and for
all:</p>
<p>	.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;which shall believe on me through their word; </p>
<p>	That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me . . .</p>
<p>	. . . that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent
me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</p>
<p>	And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love
wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. (John&nbsp;17:20,&nbsp;21,
23,&nbsp;26)</p>
<p>I find myself repeatedly asking the following questions as I ponder this and other events that took
place so close to the Savior's suffering in the garden and His betrayal: How could He pray for the
well-being and unity of others immediately before His own anguish?  What enabled Him to seek
comfort and peace for those whose need was so much less than His?  As the fallen nature of the
world He created pressed in upon Him, how could He focus so totally and so exclusively upon
the conditions and concerns of others?   How was the Master able to reach outward when a lesser
being would have turned inward?  The statement I quoted earlier from Elder Maxwell provides
the answer to each of these powerful questions:</p>
<p>	Jesus' character necessarily underwrote His remarkable atonement.  Without
Jesus' sublime character there could have been no sublime atonement!  His
character is such that He "[suffered] temptations of every kind" (Alma 7:11), yet
He gave temptations "no heed" (Doctrine and Covenants 20:22).  ("O How Great
the Plan of Our God," message delivered to CES religious educators in February
of 1995, p. 5)</p>
<p>Jesus, who suffered the most, has the most compassion for all of us who suffer so much less. 
Indeed, the depth of suffering and compassion is intimately linked to the depth of love felt by the
ministering one.  Consider the scene as Jesus emerged from His awful suffering in the Garden of
Gethsemane.  Having just sweat great drops of blood from every pore as part of the infinite and
eternal Atonement, the Redeemer encountered a multitude:</p>
<p>	And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of
the twelve, went before them, and drew unto Jesus to kiss him.  </p>
<p>	But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</p>
<p>	When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him,
Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</p>
<p>	And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. 
(Luke 22:47-50)</p>
<p>Given the magnitude and intensity of Jesus' agony, it perhaps would have been understandable if
He had not noticed and attended to the guard's severed ear.  But the Savior's character activated
a compassion that was perfect.  Note His response to the guard as described in verse 51: "And
Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far.  And he touched his ear, and healed him (Luke
22:51).</p>
<p>As individually impressive as is each of the preceding events, I believe it is the consistency of the
Lord's character across multiple episodes that is ultimately the most instructive and inspiring.  In
addition to the incidents we have thus far reviewed, recall how the Savior, while suffering such
agony on the cross, instructed the Apostle John about caring for Jesus' mother, Mary (John
19:26-27).  Consider how, as the Lord was taken to Calvary and the awful agony of the
crucifixion was commenced, He pleaded with the Father in behalf of the soldiers to ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;forgive
them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).  Remember also that in the midst of
excruciating spiritual and physical pain, the Savior offered hope and reassurance to one of the
thieves on the cross, "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise" (Luke&nbsp;23:43).  Throughout His
mortal ministry, and especially during the events leading up to and including the atoning
sacrifice, the Savior of the world turned outward--when the natural man or woman in any of us
would have been self-centered and focused inward.</p>
<p><strong>Developing a Christlike Character</strong></p>
<p>We can in mortality seek to be blessed with and develop essential elements of a Christlike
character.  Indeed, it is possible for us as mortals to strive in righteousness to receive the spiritual
gifts associated with the capacity to reach outward and appropriately respond to other people who
are experiencing the very challenge or adversity that is most immediately and forcefully pressing
upon us.  We cannot obtain such a capacity through sheer willpower or personal determination. 
Rather, we are dependent upon and in need of "the merits, mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah"
(2 Nephi 2:8).  But "line upon line, precept upon precept" (2 Nephi 28:30) and "in [the] process
of time" (Moses 7:21), we are enabled to reach outward when the natural tendency is for us to
turn inward.</p>
<p>It is interesting to me that one of the central elements of the word <em>character</em> is created by the
letters A, C, and T.  As we already have seen in the examples of Christ's character from the New
Testament, the nature and consistency of how one <strong>act</strong>s reveals in a powerful way his or her true
char<strong>act</strong>er.  In the case of Christ, he is described as one ". . . who went about doing good"
(Acts&nbsp;10:38).  Let me now briefly share with you two memorable experiences from my service as
a stake president that highlight the relationship between our <strong>act</strong>ions and a Christlike char<strong>act</strong>er.</p>
<p>Early one summer morning I was showering.  My wife called to me in the middle of my shower
and indicated that I was needed immediately on the telephone.  (This was before the day of cell
and cordless phones).  I quickly put on my robe and hurried to the phone.  I next heard the voice
of a dear sister and friend informing me of a tragic automobile accident that had just occurred in
a remote area involving three teenage young women from our stake.  Our friend indicated one of
the young women had already been pronounced dead at the scene of the accident and that the two
other young women were badly injured and presently were being transported to the regional
medical center in Fayetteville.  She further reported that the identity of the deceased young
woman was not yet known.  There was urgency in her voice, but there was no panic or excessive
alarm.  She then asked if I could go to the hospital, meet the ambulance when it arrived, and
assist in identifying the young women.  I answered that I would leave immediately.</p>
<p>During the course of our telephone conversation and as I listened to both the information being
conveyed and the voice of our friend, I gradually became aware of two important things.  First,
this friend's daughter was one of the young women involved in the accident.  Our friend lived
approximately 35 miles from the hospital and therefore needed the assistance of someone who
lived closer to the city.  Second, I detected that the mother simultaneously was using two
telephone handsets--with one in each hand pressed to each of her ears.  I became aware that as
she was talking with me, she was also talking with a nurse at a small rural hospital who had
initially attended to the three accident victims.  Our friend was receiving updated information
about the condition of the young women in the very moment she was informing me about the
accident and requesting my help.  I then heard one of the most remarkable things I have ever
heard in my life.</p>
<p>I faintly heard the nurse telling this faithful mother and friend that the young woman pronounced
dead at the scene of the accident had been positively identified as her daughter.  I could not
believe what I was hearing.  I was listening to this good woman in the very moment that she
learned of the death of her precious daughter.  Without hesitation, and with a calm and most
deliberate voice, our friend next said, "President Bednar, we must get in contact with the two
other mothers.  We must let them know as much as we can about the condition of their daughters
and that they will soon be in the hospital in Fayetteville."   There was no self-pity; there was no
self-absorption; there was no turning inward.  The Christlike character of this devoted woman
was manifested in her immediate and almost instinctive turning outward to attend to the needs of
other suffering mothers.  It was a moment and a lesson that I have never forgotten.  In a moment
of ultimate grief, this dear friend reached outward when I likely would have turned inward.</p>
<p>I then drove to the hospital with a concern in my heart for the well-being of the two other
beautiful young women who had been involved in the accident.  Little did I realize that the
lessons I would learn about Christlike character--lessons taught by seemingly ordinary
disciples--were just beginning.</p>
<p>I arrived at the hospital and proceeded to the emergency room.  After properly establishing who I
was and my relationship to the victims, I was invited into two different treatment areas to identify
the injured young women.  It was obvious that their respective wounds were serious and life
threatening.  And the lovely countenances and physical features of these young women had been
badly marred.  Within a relatively short period of time, the two remaining young women died. 
All three of these virtuous, lovely, and engaging young women--who seemed to have so much of
life in front of them--suddenly had gone home to their Eternal Father.  My attention and the
attention of the respective families now shifted to funeral arrangements and logistics.</p>
<p>A day or so later, in the midst of program planning and detail arranging for the three funerals, I
received a phone call from the Relief Society president of my home ward.  Her daughter had been
one of the victims in the accident, and she and I had talked several times about her desires for the
funeral program.  This faithful woman was a single mother rearing her only child--her teenage
daughter.  I was especially close to this woman and her daughter having served as both their
bishop and stake president.  After reviewing and finalizing several details for the funeral of her
daughter, this good sister said to me, "President, I am sure it was difficult for you to see my
daughter in the emergency room the other day.  She was severely injured and disfigured.  As you
know, we will have a closed casket at the funeral.  I have just returned from the funeral home,
and they have helped my daughter to look so lovely again.  I was just wondering .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;why don't
we arrange a time when we can meet at the mortuary and you can have one last look at her before
she is buried.  Then your final memories of my daughter will not be the images you saw in the
emergency room the other day."   I listened and marveled at the compassion and thoughtfulness
this sister had for me.  Her only daughter had just been tragically killed, but she was concerned
about the potentially troublesome memories I might have given my experience in the emergency
room.  In this good woman I detected no self-pity and no turning inward.  Sorrow, certainly. 
Sadness, absolutely.  Nevertheless, she reached outward when many or perhaps most of us would
have turned inward with sorrow and grief.</p>
<p>Let me describe one final episode related to these three tragic deaths.  On the day of her
daughter's funeral, this Relief Society president from my home ward received a phone call from
an irritated sister in our ward.  The complaining sister had a cold and did not feel well, and she
basically chewed out the Relief Society president for not being thoughtful or compassionate
enough to arrange for meals to be delivered to her home.  Just hours before the funeral of her
only child, this remarkable Relief Society president prepared and delivered a meal to the
murmuring sister.</p>
<p>We appropriately and rightly speak with reverence and awe of young men who sacrificed their
lives to rescue stranded handcart pioneers and of other mighty men and women who repeatedly
gave their all to establish the Church in the early days of the Restoration.  I speak with equal
reverence and awe of these two women--women of faith and character and conversion--who
taught me so much and instinctively reached outward when most of us would have turned
inward.  Oh how I appreciate their quiet and powerful examples.</p>
<p>I noted earlier in my remarks that the letters A, C, and T form a central component in the word
char<strong>act</strong>er.  Also noteworthy is the similarity between the words <strong>char</strong>acter and<strong> char</strong>ity--as both
words contain the letters C, H, A, and R.  Etymologically there is no relationship between these
two words.  Nevertheless, I believe there are several conceptual connections that are important
for us to consider and ponder.</p>
<p>Let me suggest that you and I must be praying and yearning and striving and working to cultivate
a Christlike <strong>char</strong>acter if we hope to receive the spiritual gift of <strong>char</strong>ity--the pure love of Christ. 
Charity is not a trait or characteristic we acquire exclusively through our own purposive
persistence and determination.  Indeed we must honor our covenants and live worthily and do all
that we can do to qualify for the gift; but ultimately the gift of charity possesses us--we do not
posses it (see Moroni 7:47).  The Lord determines if and when we receive all spiritual gifts, but
we must do all in our power to desire and yearn and invite and qualify for such gifts.  As we
increasingly <strong>act</strong> in a manner congruent with the <strong>charact</strong>er of Christ, then perhaps we are
indicating to heaven in a most powerful manner our desire for the supernal spiritual gift of<strong>
char</strong>ity.  And clearly we are being blessed with this marvelous gift as we increasingly reach
outward when the natural man or woman in us would typically turn inward.</p>
<p>I conclude now by returning to where I began--the statement by Elder Maxwell in that special
training session last September:  "There would have been no Atonement except for the character
of Christ."  It was the Prophet Joseph Smith who stated that "it is the first principle of the Gospel
to know for a certainty the Character of God" (<u>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</u>, p. 345). 
The New Testament is a rich resource for learning about and increasing our appreciation for the
character and life and example of the Savior.  My prayer for each of us is that through our study
of this sacred volume of scripture we will more fully come unto Him; more completely become
like Him; and more fervently worship, reverence, and adore Him.</p>
<p>As a witness, I declare my witness.  I know and testify and witness that Jesus is the Christ, the
Only Begotten Son of the Eternal Father.  I know that He lives.  And I testify that His character
made possible for us the opportunities for both immortality and eternal life.  May we reach
outward when the natural tendency for us is to turn inward, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">I suppose that like everybody else you like to watch movies.  We all have fond memories of one
or the other memorable movies that we saw at one time or another in our life.  For myself, I
remember very well my youngest years when I was given 40 cents by my parents to go to the
movie theater along with my little sister on Sunday afternoon.  This, by the way, was after the
Second World War, and the Church did not exist yet in our country!  We were nonmembers at
that time.  The first American movies were being shown, and we had the time of our young lives
laughing with Laurel and Hardy; exploring the jungle with Johnny Weismuller, the great Tarzan
and Jane; and discovering the American way of life with chewing gum.  Movies were not only
entertaining but also learning experiences by treasuring the stories of true and righteous heroes.</p>
<p>We usually remember movies by their titles.  Who does not remember the following: &nbsp;"The Ten
Commandments," "Ben Hur," "The Great Escape," "Miracle on 34th Street," and many others
which are now defined as classics.  Ironically, in a way, many of these movie titles carry a
spiritual connotation.  For example, I looked at a recent weekend paper with the movie reviews
and found the following titles: &nbsp;"Die Another Day" (preferably after repentance!), "Analyze
That" (the plan of salvation, of course), "Treasure Planet" (no doubt it is Kolob), "8 Miles" (they
must be talking about enduring to the end), "The Ring" (my grandson told me it was about a
CTR ring), "All or Nothing" (or what about eternal life or eternal damnation), "Abandon" (it
must be sin), "Far from Heaven" (to be meditated), "Heaven" (must be about our objective),
"Signs" (of tenets thou shalt not talk!).  Is this not a good illustration that all things in this world
have a spiritual nature?</p>
<p>Walking one day in Lima some years ago and passing in front of a movie theater, I discovered a
very interesting title.  It was in Spanish and said, "Retroceder Nunca, Rendirse Jamas." 
Translated: "We Will Never Retreat, We Will Never Surrender."  May I submit the following
spiritual thought to be attached to this title for our purpose today: &nbsp;"We will never retreat from
our religion, neither from the Church; we will never surrender to the world."</p>
<p>What is religion, what is church, what is the world?  This may be the time to think not only about
the meaning of these words but also about the consequences that they carry if we understand
them correctly.</p>
<p>Communication is composed of words.  Too often misunderstanding is a result of giving a
different meaning to a word.  Just think about the word <em>Christ</em> and ask what it means to people of
various religious groups, for example.  A study was made a few years ago to determine if fourth-graders understood LDS-related words.  These were Church members.  Here are the results:  8 of
850 words that were presented to them were understood 100 percent.  Guess what they were? 
<em>Amen, decision, fasting, forgiveness, missionary, mob, nonmember,</em> and <em>obedient</em>.  There were
240 of the 850 words understood by only 50 percent of them and less.  <em>Deity</em>, meaning <em>God</em>,
received only 6 percent of understanding!  No wonder that we may find contention in homes, in
the churches, and in the world if we do not communicate to be understood.</p>
<p>I know that you are not fourth-graders, but it might be well to see if we are in and of the same
planet, supposing that men are most of the time from Mars and women all the time from Venus!</p>
<p>So, let us start by opening our minds to the word <em>religion</em>.  Think for a moment, how would you
define it if you had to communicate the value of it in our world today?  From the dictionary, it
may mean&nbsp;"the service and worship of God or the supernatural; commitment or devotion to
religious faith; a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and
practices; a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith" (<em>Webster's New
Collegiate Dictionary</em>).  You almost need a college education to understand this phraseology!</p>
<p>To simplify and summarize this version of the word, we could say that religion is a set of
practices tied to a certain determined faith and a doctrine of the divinity.</p>
<p>If we turn instead to modern revelation, we will see from the scriptures that the definition of true
religion is "the system that the Lord ordained to enable His children to worship Him in such a
way as to gain full salvation" (Bruce R. McConkie, <em>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</em>, p.
43).  That is easier to understand!</p>
<p>Did you notice the difference between the definition of the world and the true definition given by
the Lord by revelation?  The difference is one word; it is the word <em>salvation</em>.  True religion has a
purpose, to help us to return and live in the presence of our Heavenly Father.  "This is my work
and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).</p>
<p>Let us look at a few scriptural references to better understand the principles attached to the word
<em>religion</em> because "We believe that religion is instituted of God" (Doctrine and Covenants 134:4).</p>
<p>First, and in general, you will have to defend it because it is always under attack from the world. 
Listen to the words of Moroni to the Lamanites: &nbsp;"But this is the very cause for which ye have
come against us; yea, and ye are angry with us because of our religion" (Alma 44:2).  The
Nephites were contending with the Lamanites to defend their religion. &nbsp;The Nephites were
commanded "to defend themselves, and their families, and their lands, their country, and their
rights, and their religion" (Alma 43:47).  You will notice that religion was and still is inseparably
connected to family, home, country, and rights.  The latest episode of the battle of words and
opinions about protecting rights of the Church Plaza in Salt Lake City is a vivid example of the
necessity to stand for what we believe is right.</p>
<p>Second, as an individual, you not only have to defend your religion but make a covenant to
maintain or develop religious liberty or the protection of religious human rights associated with
it.  Again, from the Book of Mormon and the example of one of the great leaders, Moroni: &nbsp;"Yea,
and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with an oath to defend
his people, his rights, and his country, and his religion" (Alma 48:13).  </p>
<p>Third, if you are now convinced to defend your religion with a covenant not only made in the
house of the Lord, you must be persuaded to live by it in the world; that means to practice the
spirit of that religion in your daily life among your peers, to exercise charity and to be morally
clean, as James taught:</p>
<p>	"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.  For if any
be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in
a glass: For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what
manner of man he was.  But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed
in his deed.  If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but
deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.  Pure religion and undefiled before
God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
keep himself unspotted from the world" (James&nbsp;1:22-27).</p>
<p>In summary now, to belong to a religion or to be religious has the following implications:  to
defend it; to stand for it with a covenant ever in the Lord's house, the temple; to live in the world
by its ordinances and principles; to exercise charity and to be free from moral stains.  That
represents a lot of unexpected requirements if we do not perceive correctly what religion means. 
Too often, as we consider that religion is action in words and deeds, our first reaction is to retreat
from this responsibility and to surrender to the easy way instead of enduring to the end! 
Remember, however, our theme of the day: &nbsp;"Never Retreat, Never Surrender."</p>
<p>What is really the problem of our day with religion?  Individually, it is the temptation to create its
own religion and use its own so-called power to administer it.  That is why we have such a
personal confusion today.  Collectively, it is the temptation to use religion to impose
discrimination under a form of fundamentalism.  The wars of religion never die.</p>
<p>The prophet Joseph F. Smith said the following: &nbsp;"No man, in and of himself, without the aid of
the Spirit of God and the direction of revelation, can found a religion, or promulgate a body of
doctrine, in all particulars in harmony with revealed truth.  If he has not the inspiration of the
Lord and the direction of messengers from his presence, he will not comprehend the truth, and
therefore such truth as he teaches will be hopelessly mixed with error.  This is proved to be the
case with many professed founders of religious creeds.  Their teachings cannot be made to square
themselves with the revelations of Jesus Christ and his prophets" (DS 1:189).</p>
<p>True religion associated automatically with the worship of a true and living God and his gospel
leading to salvation has been the exception rather than the rule throughout the history of
mankind.  Since the beginning and commencing with the children of Adam, who had been
brought to the knowledge of the plan of salvation, the temptation has always been to transform
religion into a form of service to himself to satisfy his pride, his ambitions, and his natural
condition, which is carnal, sensual, and devilish.  It started with Cain and continues in our day
with his followers.  "For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of
Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and
putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord"
(Mosiah 3:19).</p>
<p>Can you start to see why true religion is essential because it leads to the true Church and thus to
eternal salvation through the Atonement of Christ.</p>
<p>Let's have a look now at the word <em>church</em>.  Is it the same thing as religion?  We will see that the
word <em>church</em> is always associated with religion.  Its original meaning is that of a group of faithful,
a body of religious believers having the same doctrine and gathering together.  Again this world
definition is missing the essential, the one that we already discovered was missing in our
definition of religion.  It is <em>salvation</em>.</p>
<p>The Church is, in true reality, the divinely established organization through which the gospel or
plan of redemption--the plan of happiness, also called the plan of salvation--is taught, is
prepared and practiced by receiving the ordinances of salvation administered by the authority, the
priesthood (Doctrine and Covenants 84:19-20).</p>
<p>There is a difference between the church of man and the true church of God, the same way that
there is a difference between the religion of man and the true religion of God.  Elder Bruce R.
McConkie defined the Lord's Church this way: &nbsp;"It is a formal and official organization with
prescribed officers, defined units, approved doctrines, and authorized ordinances.  Its ministers
are endowed with power from on high; they hold the holy priesthood, and they are empowered to
act in the place and stead of the Lord Jesus.  Miracles and gifts of the Spirit always abound
within its folds; its way of worship is always pure and perfect Christianity.  And it always bears
the name of that Lord whose church it is" (Bruce R. McConkie, <em>A New Witness for the Articles of
Faith</em>, p. 329).</p>
<p>In the gospel of Jesus Christ, personal religious experience is the foundation, vitality, and
culmination of religious life (<em>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</em>, "Religious Experience," p. 1208). 
The Church is the vehicle that is used through personal religious experiences to reach our
destination called salvation.  Can any church do that?  You may remember that finding the true
church of God was the initial quest of Joseph Smith, confronted with a multiplicity of churches
with different doctrines.  He told us that there was "an unusual excitement on the subject of
religion" because of the competition between the different faiths and their preachers to attract
converts (JS--H, v. 5-6).  He concluded his thinking with these words:&nbsp; "What is to be done? 
Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together?  If any one of them be right,
which is it and how shall I know it?" (JS--H, v. 10).</p>
<p>That question could only be answered from on high, by revelation as it happened in other
dispensations before when truth had been taken away when people rejected the gospel and fell
into apostasy.  God always reveals the gospel of Jesus Christ to witnesses, to prophets that He
chooses, not directly to all people: &nbsp;"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his
secret unto his servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7).  Truth about the plan of salvation is eternal
and unchanging and comes, as I said, only by revelation from God.</p>
<p>Inspired by the scriptures and the testimonies of former witnesses of Christ, the original
Apostles, Joseph Smith came to the determination "to ask of God."  The answer came through a
vision: &nbsp;He saw two Personages, the Father and the Son, and was answered not to join any of the
religions of the day for they were all wrong, teaching incorrect doctrines.</p>
<p>Is that unbelievable?  Certainly not if you are familiar with the Lord's ways to communicate truth
to the one that He calls as a prophet to restore what was lost and to teach once again to men to
rely on revelation from on high instead of their own wisdom.</p>
<p>Why is it necessary to mention the uniqueness of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus
Christ?  Once again, because the temptation is, more than ever today, to join a church that
appeals to our preferences and prejudices, that is agreeable to our worldly nature and not to our
divine nature.  Or, more simply, to abandon the religious battlefield and declare: &nbsp;"I am not
religious any more, but I am spiritual!"  The warning about this temptation to change the
ordinances or break the everlasting covenant is given in the preface of the Doctrine and
Covenants and is obvious:</p>
<p>	"They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own
way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and
whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even
Babylon the great, which shall fall" (Doctrine and Covenants 1:16).</p>
<p>Once we have accepted to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints because of our
faith in Jesus Christ and our repentance, because of His Atonement by a covenant called baptism,
once again, there is no time to retreat from that covenant, no room to surrender to our own ways. 
The Church is an essential element of salvation.  It cannot be replaced by a salad bar from which
you choose what you like.  President Gordon B. Hinckley emphasized the importance of that
association in a general conference:</p>
<p>	"To young people everywhere I should like to say that you need the Church, and the
Church needs you.  There is no better association than that with other young men and
women of faith who recognize God as their Eternal Father and Jesus Christ as the living
Savior of the world.</p>
<p>	"That association will give you strength.  It will give you companionship.  It will
challenge your abilities.  It will afford you opportunity for growth.  In The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints there is office and responsibility for all" (Gordon B.
Hinckley, Conference Report, April 1967, p. 54).</p>
<p>Now, after religion, after church, what about the world?  Are we not supposed to be experts in
the knowledge of what it is all about because that's where we spend our life, our energy, our
hopes?  The name <em>world</em> may signify many things.  There are at least 14 entries in the dictionary
to define it.  For our purpose, looking at things from a spiritual point of view, we will take the
following definitions: &nbsp;"The sphere or scene of one's life and action"; "The concerns of the earth
and its affairs as distinguished from heaven and the life to come."</p>
<p>Moving to the spiritual meaning is quite interesting.  It seems that we have more warnings about
that sphere than anything else!  I found more than two and one-half pages of references to it in
the Topical Guide in the standard works.  From those quotes, it seems to be a very dangerous
place to live unless, once again, we use the knowledge received from a loving Father in Heaven
to preserve us from its dangers.  The first warning: &nbsp;"In the world ye shall have tribulation."  But
also, the first help: &nbsp;"But be of good cheer; I (Jesus Christ) have overcome the world"
(John&nbsp;16:33).  The "how to" overcome the world abounds in the teachings of Jesus Christ and
His Apostles:  "Be not conformed to this world" (Romans 12:2).  Don't rely on the so-called
wisdom of the world, says Paul: &nbsp;"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God" (1
Corinthians 3:19).  Beware of the wrong friendshiping: &nbsp;"Know ye not that the friendship of the
world is enmity with God?" (James 4:4).  Attention worshipers of things of the world: &nbsp;"Love not
the world, neither the things that are in the world.  If any man love the world, the love of the
Father is not in him" (1 John 2:15).  All of this you may say belongs to the old world.  After all,
we are a new generation; we know better.  Maybe.  Why then these words by a modern prophet? 
President Gordon B. Hinckley admonishes us today against the ways of the world:</p>
<p>	"We have a different way of life.  There is a difference.  It is a way of life and it doesn't
fit the mold that a lot of people have.  So we are different and they use the word <em>weird</em>. . .
.  We live in the world, we are part of the world, but we don't need to take on all the ways
of the world.  That makes us appear different and I suppose weird.  But we are not
weird."  (Interview with Bob Anderson of <em>60 Minutes</em>, December 6, 1995.)</p>
<p>Do we appear weird because we try to live the gospel?  President Hinckley reassures us by
inviting us to live our religion in the Church:</p>
<p>	"All of us live in the world.  Of course we do.  We cannot live a cloistered existence.  But
we can live in the world without partaking of the unseemly ways of the world.  "The pull
gets ever stronger.  The adversary is clever and subtle.  He speaks in a seductive voice of
fascinating and attractive things.  We cannot afford to let down our guard. . . .  We need
not run the wrong way.  The right way is simple.  It means following the program of the
Church, bringing into our lives the principles of the gospel, and never losing sight of what
is expected of us as sons of God with a great inheritance and a marvelous and eternal
potential."  ("Don't Drop the Ball," <em>Ensign</em>, November 1994, p. 48.)</p>
<p>In some closing remarks in a later General Authority training meeting, his conclusion seems to be
very familiar when he counseled not to retreat from our moral standards, never to surrender to the
world:</p>
<p>	"We see all around us a worldly creep that is destructive of faith. . . .  I know that the
temporal things of life are important.  I know that we as a people must live in the world. 
But I hope that we will not surrender ourselves to the world."  (General Authority
Training Meeting, September 27, 1994.)</p>
<p>Let us also now turn to the voice of the world and listen to a few alarm signals ringing loud and
clear even from this secular world:</p>
<p>	". . . [It] seems like many young people today are picking and choosing elements of
several religions to form their own individualized spirituality.  According to Princeton
sociologist Robert Wunthow, students today are piecing together their faith like a
patchwork quilt.  'Spirituality has become a vastly complex quest in which each person
seeks his or her own way,' said Wunthow" (Mark Weber, "The New College
Spirituality," <em>Relevant Magazine</em>, June 17, 2002).</p>
<p>In Europe, more and more people continue to move away from organized religions and churches. 
In 11 of those countries, religion is ranked as "very important" by an average of only 17 percent
of those surveyed (Europeans and Religion.  Information Center News, Vol. 12, Nr. 15 Oct.
2002).</p>
<p>	"Kristine Greenaway, director of communications for the World Council of Churches in
Geneva, said Europeans were spiritual, 'but not necessarily in an organizational sense. 
They have the same questions about a supreme being, about prayer and life after death
and they have a deep and sophisticated belief system, even if they are not part of an
institution.'  North Americans, on the other hand, have a "consumer oriented" approach
to religion, a 'cafeteria mentality.  We are individualists, so we think we can pick the
church that suits us'" (<em>International Herald Tribune</em>, Barry James, "Religion plays a vital
role for 6 in 10 Americans, survey reveals," Dec. 21, 2002).</p>
<p>In the U.S., the number of American adults who claim no religious preference has more than
doubled in the last 10 years.  Let me quote from James Hitchcock, who wrote about "Christianity
American Style":</p>
<p>	"While the United States is recognized as one of the few industrialized countries where
religion is still strong, its culture often seems at odds with traditional religious values." 
Mr. Hitchcock's conclusion:&nbsp; ". . . Americans tend to value religion insofar as they regard
it as supportive of their personal lives but not when it seems to 'interfere' in their lives or
make demands on them.  They are deeply religious in a sense, but their commitment
proves fragile when it fails to provide the emotional support they seek."</p>
<p>	Hitchcock's other comments:&nbsp;&nbsp;"The orthodox belief that human beings survive after death
is warmly accepted by believers primarily insofar as it promises personal happiness, not
insofar as it threatens punishment."  Three-fourths of all Christians think that people
should determine their own beliefs independent of any organized religion.</p>
<p>	In his concern over what he perceived as the growing gap between traditional Christian
teachings and personal beliefs, Hitchcock averred:</p>
<p>		The very religiosity of American culture is often turned against Christianity, in
that the entire world has now been made to seem like a spiritual garden in which
people can browse as they see fit, plucking the flowers that smell fragrant. 
Plucking them does not require accepting the church's discipline--literally
becoming a disciple--but merely savoring the scent and leaving the rest.  The
ultimate test of religious authenticity is now thought to be personal feelings,
which are among the few things the culture still regards as sacred.  Religion has
value insofar as it makes the individual feel good.  (James Hitchcock,
"Christianity American Style," Touchstone 14:10, December 2001: 3-5.)</p>
<p>It seems thus that for more and more young and older people, the personal experience is of more
value than the teaching of religion in a church.  They are, however, forgetting a major truth, as
James E. Talmage said: &nbsp;"that man alone cannot save himself; Christ alone cannot save him"
(The Co-operative Plan of Salvation, <em>Improvement Era</em>, June 1917, p. 705).</p>
<p>What is the Lord's answer to this calamity where people take in their own hands their terrestrial
salvation and believe that they can work out their salvation alone with no need of religion and the
Church, where they believe that to hold to a few good principles that all will be well with them? 
The Lord declared by revelation to the need to belong to a church, His Church, with these
unequivocal words: &nbsp;"[I] called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from
heaven, and gave him commandments . . . [to] proclaim these things unto the world . . . that faith
also might increase in the earth; that mine everlasting covenant might be established; that the
fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed; . . . that also those to whom these commandments
were given, might have power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of
obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth"
(Doctrine and Covenants 1:17-30).</p>
<p>Since the time of his mortal ministry to the restoration of his original church, Christ established
the spiritual absolute that salvation can only come "in his Church, and of the Church and is
obtained only through his Church" (Mark E. Petersen, Conference Report, Apr. 1973, p. 157). 
The great purpose of the Church thus is to not only bring salvation to men but to also make our
religion an effective way of daily life centered in our Savior Jesus Christ and the teachings of his
prophets.  It is the way to perfect our lives and to prepare us for eternal life.</p>
<p>It is time now to come to the essential provided by religion and the Church that the world cannot
provide, which is salvation.  It is Alma who taught that "this life is the time for men to prepare to
meet God" (Alma 34:32).  Salvation depends on knowledge as the knowledge of divine and
spiritual things is absolutely essential to it, and that is why the gospel is to be taught to every
soul.  That is why the Lord has repeatedly warned the parents to teach the Lord's ways to their
children; that is why missionaries are called to give the voice of warning to all nations and all
people; that is why we have the ordinances of the temple for the dead.  All of this with the same
simple purpose that people might prepare their salvation the Lord's way in His Church:</p>
<p>	"I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship, and
know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time
receive of his fulness" (Doctrine and Covenants 93:19).</p>
<p>True religion, true church, true knowledge of the nature of the Godhead, true worship, true
authority of the priesthood, true ordinances are the essentials for gaining our salvation.  It is a
process that we need to know, that we need to testify about, that we need to share, that we need
to live and to defend.  Salvation is in Christ, in His Atonement and is the greatest of all the
covenants; it is the new and everlasting covenant.  A covenant by which we have the promise to
return and live in the presence of our Heavenly Father by having faith in Christ, repenting of our
sins and accepting the ordinances of salvation, namely, baptism by immersion for the remission
of our sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, priesthood for males, the endowment and the sealing in
the temple.</p>
<p>Salvation is also the greatest gift of God:</p>
<p>	"If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the
kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God; for there is no gift greater
than the gift of salvation" (Doctrine and Covenants 6:13).</p>
<p>	"And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life,
which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (Doctrine and Covenants 14:7).</p>
<p>Three words, three steps towards life after death: &nbsp;religion, church, salvation.  They cannot be
disassociated.  They rely on each other, and all of them are based on revelation from on high.  It
is because of revelation that we are here today; that you can enjoy the blessings of education in
this marvelous BYU-Idaho facility; that we know the truth, the way, and the life, even Jesus
Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>
<p>Never deny this knowledge, this testimony that He is the Son of the living God.  Never retreat to
your own ideas of religion or church, never surrender to the world.  The miracle of the divine
mission of Jesus Christ is to change our mortal nature into a divine nature and to give us a divine
destiny because of His Atonement.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: -20px">Of all the knowledge that was lost to mankind during that period we refer to as the Great Apostasy, nothing was more important, nothing had a greater potential for wreaking calamity in cultures and in the lives and hearts of the children of God, than the loss of the understanding of the true nature of God.&nbsp;  At the beginning of the great intercessory prayer (John 17:3) the Savior declared:</p>
<p align="LEFT">And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Joseph Smith taught, in relation to this, that <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Teachings, p. 343).&nbsp; This sounds descriptive of our own time.&nbsp; This state of affairs works to the advantage of the adversary, wearing down souls, haunting them with the specter of nothingness and meaninglessness, and dulling their sensitivity to the good and to the spirit of truth.  Indeed, the Lord himself declared that one major purpose of the Restoration of the Gospel was so that we <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
<i> </i>. . . might understand and know <i>how</i> to worship, and know <i>what</i> [we] worship, that [we] may come unto the Father in [his] name . . .<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Doctrine and Covenants 93:19, emphasis added).&nbsp;  I want give an example of the importance of this knowledge in the life of one young man.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">I am acquainted with a young man <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 now no longer quite so young <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 who was reared in an LDS home.&nbsp; He understood the doctrine of the Godhead, that the Father and the Son are separate beings and that they have bodies 
&quot;of flesh and bones, as tangible as man<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s
 . . .&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants 130:22).&nbsp;  However, the philosophies of men were also deeply 
entrenched in this young man<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s culture and he and his family were not immune.&nbsp;  He listened to traditional teachings of God<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s power and omniscience influenced by ideas born in the apostate era.&nbsp;  He learned that, due to his nature, God was very different from us.  In his father<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s terms, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>God is as different from us in his intellect as we are different from earthworms.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>&nbsp;
  The metaphor of caring for and watching for a colony of earthworms as a model for God<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s watching over us played itself out vividly in this young boy<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s mind.&nbsp;  He also learned that this very smart and distant God knew all the principles by which everything operated.&nbsp; The young man concluded that such a God was very busy <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 far too busy to have much time, let alone much concern, for any particular earthworm such as he.&nbsp; And yet, he was taught that this same God is mindful of everything, such that even a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his knowing it (Matthew 10:29).&nbsp;  The young man<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s again concluded that God must have some sort of cosmic mind that can detect <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>disturbances in the force<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 so to speak.&nbsp; But, he didn't feel much better as a <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>disturbance<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 than he did as a earthworm.&nbsp; While this understanding of God made intellectual sense to him, the more he contemplated on these things, the more the young man felt lost in a vast cosmic network of causes and effects, but very far from a great but impersonal God.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It became increasingly difficult for this young man to understand what it meant to <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>love<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 this God, although he tried.&nbsp;  He felt an obligation to love God out of respect for his superior nature, but it was a love born of fear and intellect, almost untouched by emotion.&nbsp;  It was hard to love an abstraction, even one with a body of flesh and bones.&nbsp; He did know that God loved him, he was told so many times.&nbsp; Perfect beings are required to love everyone.&nbsp;   Being an earthworm, he was not sure what it was like for God to love him.&nbsp; More importantly, this young man was quite sure that however much God might love him, God<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s actions <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 as a perfectly rational being <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 were hopelessly determined by the inalterable network of laws and principles that bound this perfectly rational God to act in particular ways, so that love could never modify the inevitable natural consequences of the young man<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s acts, or anyone else<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s for that matter.&nbsp;  It was a tough, loving God who presided over such a finely tuned web of unalterable principles.  Finally, the young man began to wonder how or why an infinitely intelligent God, bound by abstract laws and principles, would need to <i>really</i> listen to prayers; and besides, God  already knew both what the boy needed and whether it would be possible to grant it.&nbsp; Nothing really hung in the balance at prayer time.&nbsp; Prayers were dutifully said, but given his understanding of God, they could not be otherwise than hollow <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 echoing off the ceiling.&nbsp; This young man, I<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
m happy to report stayed quite faithful, although quite melancholy, into adulthood.&nbsp; He tried very hard to believe what he was taught, but what he did believe brought little comfort.&nbsp; 
It is with a mixture of sorrow over lost time, and great relief that today, after more than forty years, he can say with genuine conviction and joy, that he loves God, and he knows what he means when he says it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">I have related this true story for two reasons.&nbsp; First, I have wondered how many of you might have thought or felt, at one time or another, anything like this young man thought and felt.  Perhaps, choice spirits that you are, you never have, but maybe you know someone who has.&nbsp;  I have related the story so that you might be able to help those who struggle to find the God of the restored gospel in the midst of a world where the nature of God is misunderstood, the heavens are created by the intellects of men, and the quality of mercy is strained through a network of abstractions.&nbsp; Second, I wanted to use this true story to introduce the real important subject of this talk, the God of Condescension, because it was in coming to know <i>this</i> God that the young man<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s story had a happy ending.&nbsp; Before being introduced to this God, however, we need to deal with the problem of abstractions and be introduced to another God.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Problem with Abstractions </p>
<p align="LEFT">William of Ockham (1285-1347), a fourteenth century English cleric, alerted the people of his day, and of ours, to what he called <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
the worst error of philosophy.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64; </font>&nbsp;He warned us of the dangers and foolishness of assuming that abstractions are real.&nbsp; Only particulars are real, he asserts; abstractions are mere products of the mind, existing only in language.&nbsp; I believe that he got that right.&nbsp; Nevertheless, 700 year later, we continue to make the same mistake.&nbsp;  For example, we experience ourselves as 
&quot;willing,&quot;
 performing acts of willing.&nbsp;  We willingly do some act, or will ourselves not to do another.&nbsp; Then, when we try to explain our acts of willing, we create an abstraction, called <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
the will,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 and make it the supposed source of our actions.  We thus take <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
the will<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 to be a real thing with power, and make it the cause of our actions.  Thus, in many ways, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
the will<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 becomes more real than the concrete acts of willing it was invented to explain.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The problem with abstractions like this is that they fool us into thinking that they explain things when they simply name them.&nbsp; We might ask, for example, why objects fall towards the earth.  The answer?  Because of <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
gravity.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64; </font>&nbsp;And what, we may ask, is gravity?&nbsp; Why, it<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s the force that makes things fall towards the earth.&nbsp; And how do you know gravity exists?&nbsp; Well, because, everything falls toward the earth. . . You see the problem, I hope.&nbsp; Gravity is not an explanation for <u>why</u> things fall toward the earth.&nbsp; It is simply a description of the fact that they <u>do</u>.&nbsp; Lest you think I<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
m making all this up, I can assure you that Sir Isaac Newton himself saw this very problem and finally concluded that he did not know what gravity <u>is</u>, but he was confident in his precise description of what it <u>does</u>.&nbsp; This is a good example to follow.&nbsp; I want to suggest we can learn something of vital importance by concentrating on actions, rather than believing in the reality and the power of abstractions.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Bear with me as we consider some more compelling and relevant examples.&nbsp; How about the project of acquiring certain virtues.&nbsp; We may , for example, desire <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
integrity,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 as well we should.&nbsp; Of what could integrity consist other than to <u>act</u> consistently with one<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s professed beliefs?  Thus, when properly understood, our task is not to acquire integrity, but to act in a particular, consistent way.&nbsp; Similarly, we may have endless debates about the nature of <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>love,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 with all of its endlessly nuanced definitions, all the while overlooking that love exists really <u>as</u> loving <u>acts</u>.&nbsp; Thus, the challenge of life is to act lovingly, not to understand and acquire some abstract quality of love.&nbsp; To exalt abstractions over actions leads to privileging ideas over behavior.&nbsp; We seek rationality <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 the cognitive <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 as a guide in our lives rather than seeking models of virtue to whom we can apprentice ourselves.&nbsp; The rational becomes more important than the material consequences of our actions in the lives of all those around us.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To get to the heart of today<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s topic, consider the following.&nbsp; We believe the first two principles of the gospel are faith and repentance.&nbsp; We can now ask ourselves whether faith is best understood as an abstraction which we must acquire, or wait for it to distill upon us, or whether faith, inherently consists of a way of living <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 faithfully <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 based on our confidence in god, our experience with the spirit, and our tasting of the sweet fruits of living the commandments.&nbsp; Surely this non-abstract, action-based nature of faith was what James had in mind when he wrote:</p>
<p align="LEFT">Even so faith, if it hath not works is dead, being alone.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works</p>
<p align="LEFT"> . . . and by works was faith made perfect . . .</p>
<p align="LEFT">We might ask a similar question regarding repentance.&nbsp; Ought we to understand repentance as a mere abstraction, as a process having in itself the power to wring forgiveness out of an offended universe?&nbsp; Or, perhaps we can profit from understanding repentance as action, a way of living, a deeply-felt crucifixion of the man of sin, hating sin, developing a broken, sorrowful heart, offering the heart to our Father and His Christ, desiring good, longing for peace and for approval, and <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>giving away all [our ]sins to know [God] . . .<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Alma 22:18, emphasis added).  I fear that so long as repentance is an abstraction we may miss the active nature of it, and we may overlook Him who plays the most active role of all.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Which brings us to my final example.&nbsp; We all know, and believe, that salvation and eternal life are made possible by and through the atonement of Christ.&nbsp; However, if we are not careful, we may begin to look at the atonement itself as a powerful abstraction possessing in itself hidden processes that have power to save.&nbsp;  In doing this, however, we may forget that we are not saved by an abstraction.&nbsp; We are saved by a person.&nbsp; Do we understand things in a new light if we remember that the atonement is not an abstraction, but the description of what Jesus Christ did for us, and, indeed what he continues to do?&nbsp;  It is to him we must look, and not to an abstraction.&nbsp; It is he whom we love.&nbsp; We cannot love an abstraction.&nbsp; The Savior taught the Nephites:</p>
<p align="LEFT">. . . and this is the gospel which I have given unto you <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 that I came into the world to do the will of my Father . . . that I might be lifted up upon the cross . . . that I might draw all men unto me . . . </p>
<p align="LEFT">Notice here that the gospel is equated with the actions of the Savior himself and not an abstract principle or proposition.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The God of Philosophy</p>
<p align="LEFT">I apologize if this journey through medieval scholastic philosophy, and through what may seem like obscure philosophical distinctions has been dreary and sterile.&nbsp; 
It must seem so in large part because abstractions themselves, divorced from the concrete actions of gods and persons which give life and meaning, really are dreary and sterile.&nbsp; 
My purpose has been to set forth the conceptual grounds for understanding the 
god of philosophy  (This term is not meant to be an indictment of philosophy, but merely the pedigree of an idea).&nbsp;  The tendency of humans to create abstractions and endow them with causal power and to consider them to be more perfect and more real than concrete acts of real embodied beings reaches its full theological stature in the god defined and described by the philosophies of men, forged in the furnaces of intellect, and fashioned by the dim light of apostasy.&nbsp; The traditional god of Christianity is the ultimate abstraction.&nbsp; Without body, parts, or passions, this god is better referred to by the pronoun <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>it,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 than by <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>he.&quot;&nbsp;
  This god is admired and worshiped chiefly because of its knowledge, intellect, and power.&nbsp; That he (or it) would care for us is more mystery than anything else, and because it is a mystery how a god who either is pure abstract principle, or is bound and determined by abstract principle, could love us and care for us, that very love and care are always tenuous and uncertain.&nbsp; Certainly if god is understood to be only the nexus of an intricate web of abstract laws and principles it is difficult to see how he can deal with us except indirectly through the operation of those principles, and it is difficult to develop motivations for obedience to god that are more sophisticated and more pure than simple fear of the consequences of laws and principles.&nbsp; The admonition to <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
fear God,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Ecclesiastes 12:13; 2 Nephi 28:28), takes on a fearful character indeed when God is understood to be the principle of operation of the cosmos.&nbsp;  It would be something rather like the admonition one might give to a person clinging precariously to the edge of a great precipice, to  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>fear gravity.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT">Now, where did this god, the god of philosophy come from?&nbsp; Why is it a part of our modern culture?   We are taught that the period referred to as the Great Apostasy was brought on by the death of the Apostles of the Lord, and by the drift within the Christian Church toward the dominant doctrines, philosophies, and sins of the day.&nbsp; As the apostles perished and either could not or did not see fit to call other <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
special witnesses,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 there were soon no authorities among the people who could say <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>I saw . . .<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 or <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>Thus saith the Lord . . .<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (see <i>The World and the Prophets</i> by Hugh Nibley for readable account of this state of affairs and its implications).&nbsp;  Well meaning Christians were faced with the task of keeping the church alive and defending it from attack both inside and out.&nbsp; It is not surprising then, that they turned to Greek philosophy which was the most sophisticated and respected doctrine of its day.&nbsp; The rational methods of Greek philosophy provided effective means <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 it must surely have appeared <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 of defending the faith, and justifying, or rationally proving, the existence of god and the reasonableness of Christian beliefs.&nbsp; One major consequence of this strategy <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 however well intentioned it may have been <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 was that the abstractions which were the foundation of Greek philosophy also became the foundation of Christian theology.&nbsp; The God of Christianity became the non-physical, unembodied entity best understood as a rationally necessary <i>first cause</i>, or the <i>unmoved mover</i>, that power necessary to the existence of all other things, akin to <i>pure thought that thinks only itself</i>, or <i>sufficient reason</i>.&nbsp; This god is so different from us that it cannot be comprehended or known directly, only by analogy, or indirectly by inference from the imperfect and temporary world.&nbsp; 
This god can be <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>seen<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 in nature, and in the lawful patterns and principles that operate throughout the universe, or intuited from mystical experiences that resist plain understanding and are not usually adequately communicated to others.&nbsp; Faith became a type of positive thinking, something to fill the void between us and the essentially unknowable.&nbsp; Theology was born.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It is worth pointing out that although what I have said here characterizes theology, the official religious doctrines of traditional Christianity, the experience of individual Christians has always been more private and spirit-filled, for God has continued to work with his children even in those times of darkness when he was relatively unknown by them.&nbsp;  Nonetheless, what I have described here was roughly the state of organized Christian religion in the nineteenth century, at the time of the Restoration.&nbsp; The appearance of the Father and the Son to Joseph Smith was, in itself, a refutation of all prevailing theologies.&nbsp; It is little wonder that Joseph once remarked that a man could learn more by gazing into heaven for an hour than he could through all the theologies available.&nbsp; However, the events of the restoration have not entirely done away with all the deeply ingrained ways of thinking that arose during the centuries while the 
fullness of the gospel was not available.&nbsp; The power of abstractions, and the effects of thinking of our religion and our relationship with God in terms of abstractions, is difficult to overcome.&nbsp; It is my belief and my testimony that they are fully overcome through our coming to know the God of Condescension.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The God of Condescension</p>
<p align="LEFT">I want now to set the stage for the God of Condescension, a God made known to us with overwhelming clarity in the scriptures of the restoration.&nbsp; In modern scripture we can find two places where God had the perfect opportunity to express in clear terms, to a prophet who had literally seen <u>everything</u>, the laws and principles <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 the abstractions <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 by which he and the universe operate, if, indeed, such laws and principles were the operative forces.&nbsp; But he did not.&nbsp; Instead, following Moses<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s vision recorded in Moses, Chapter 1, God declared:</p>
<p align="LEFT">For behold, this is my work and my glory <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man </p>
<p align="LEFT">The secret shown to Moses was not an abstraction, but a work, a family, the active involvement of a God who has a purpose and who intervenes in the lives of his children.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Likewise, after Enoch was shown all the inhabitants of the earth and all its generations, and the spectacle of the work of salvation (Moses 7:21-27), he recorded, not his understanding of the abstract principles of heaven, but rather, he bore his witness that the God of heaven wept (Moses 7:28).&nbsp; As he pressed for an explanation of this he was told the source of this consummate sorrow.&nbsp; It was that God had:</p>
<p align="LEFT">. . . given commandment, that [his children] should love one another, and that they should choose him, their Father; but . . . they [were] without affection, and they hate their own blood . . . </p>
<p align="LEFT">When the Lord could have expressed the Gospel in abstraction, he spoke of his sorrow and of his relationship to his children.&nbsp; Furthermore he showed Enoch the 
fulfillment of his promised response to the predicament of his children.&nbsp; Thus, Enoch <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>beheld the Son of Man lifted up on the cross after the manner of men . . .<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
  (Moses 7:55), and the spirits in prison delivered.&nbsp; It is this act, which drew Enoch<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s focus, that I want to focus our attention on, for this is the ultimate signature act of the God of Condescension.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In Lehi<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s vision recorded by Nephi in 1 Nephi, Chapter 8, he <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>. . . beheld a tree whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>&nbsp;
 When Lehi partook, he found that fruit to be <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>. . . most sweet, above all [he] ever before tasted,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 and <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>. . . it filled [his] soul with exceeding great joy&quot;
 (1 Nephi 8:11-12, emphasis added).&nbsp;  Later, Nephi wanted to know the interpretation of this tree and the fruit.&nbsp; He is given that interpretation in 1 Nephi, Chapter 11, and here it might be helpful to turn to the scriptures and work through them.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">In verse 11, Nephi asks for an interpretation of the tree he had just been shown <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 the same one that Lehi had seen.&nbsp; Here he might have been lectured on the nature of <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>love,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 or on the abstract symbolism of <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>trees<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 and <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
fruit,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 but instead, he was told to <u>look</u>.&nbsp; In verse 13 he sees Jerusalem and Nazareth, and an exceedingly fair virgin <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 and then (in verse 16) the question: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>Knowest thou the condescension of God?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64; </font>&nbsp;This word, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>condescension<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 is a very interesting word.&nbsp; It<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s literal meaning, derived from its Latin roots, is coming down, or descending, to be with someone.&nbsp; In the English of Joseph Smith<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s time we find the following definitions of the word <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>condescend:<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font></p>
<p align="LEFT">To descend from the privileges of superior rank or dignity, to do some act to an inferior, which strict justice . . . does not require.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To stoop or descend; to yield, to submit; implying  a relinquishment of rank, or dignity of character</p>
<p align="LEFT">Nephi is told (in verse 18) that this virgin is <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64; </font>
  Then he sees the child and is told (in verse 21) that this child is <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>. . . the Son of The Eternal Father. . .<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 and asked whether he now understands the meaning of the tree of life and its fruit.&nbsp; From what he had seen, and by the power of the Spirit, he did know, and answered (in verse 22) that <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>. . . it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore it is the most desirable above all things.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>&nbsp;
  And the angel reminded him (in verse 23) that it was also, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>. . . the most joyous to the soul.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>&nbsp;
  He knew that love was not an abstraction, but that it is most clearly understood in the person of an embodied God, and most exquisitely expressed in his condescension.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Later in this same chapter Nephi sees the ministry of the Savior among mankind.&nbsp;  And then, he witnesses the ultimate act of condescension:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> . . . And I . . . beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.&nbsp; And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world </p>
<p align="LEFT">Nephi<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s brother, Jacob, taught:</p>
<p align="LEFT">. . . for it behooveth the great Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto man in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become subject unto him </p>
<p align="LEFT">And the prophet, Alma, taught his son, Corianton:</p>
<p align="LEFT">And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also </p>
<p align="LEFT">The purpose of the great condescension of God was to bring about mercy.&nbsp; If mercy was his purpose, mercy must have certainly been his motivation also.&nbsp; Condescension is not in the repertoire of the god of philosophy.&nbsp; It is generally explained as a mystery, or the revelation of some attribute of God; but the Book of Mormon is clear.&nbsp; It is God himself, motivated by mercy, who condescends with his whole soul.&nbsp; Again, in Alma, we get further insight into the heart of the God of Condescension.&nbsp; After recounting the very important detail of Jesus<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s mortal birth, Alma explains:</p>
<p align="LEFT">And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities </p>
<p align="LEFT">The intent of God<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s great condescension was to bring about mercy.&nbsp; It also made possible repentance as our access to mercy.&nbsp; As Alma explains this, it becomes clear that in the context provided by God<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s condescension, the concept of <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>law<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 is very different than <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>law<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 as an abstraction in the context of the god of philosophy:</p>
<p align="LEFT">And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to the great and last sacrifice; and the great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles [us] in the arms of safety . . . </p>
<p align="LEFT">Being encircled in the arms of mercy is a much more powerful image once we understand that the God of Condescension has literal arms, and not just metaphorical arms.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For many religions in the world, and even for some Christians who are relieved not to believe that God could really condescend in order to suffer, it is untoward and degrading to believe that their god should suffer.&nbsp; It is beneath the dignity of a god to experience this.&nbsp; Because of modern scripture and revelation we know that our god indeed suffered.&nbsp;  In Paul<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s words, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Hebrews 5:15).&nbsp; Because we have a Savior who can be touched, says Paul, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Hebrews 5:16).  </p>
<p align="LEFT">My young friend, to whom I referred earlier, did not understand how to go boldly unto the throne of grace because grace seemed like an abstraction, because the god of philosophy seemed so abstract.&nbsp; I have not been immune from falling into a similar trap.&nbsp; When I was in graduate school Camille and I became friends with a Hindu couple.&nbsp; On one occasion, I spoke about religion with the husband.&nbsp;  He explained that, to the Hindu, Christianity seems like a morally soft religion because it teaches that it is always possible to avoid the effects of one<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s bad actions, in contrast to the inevitability of the consequences of our actions brought about by Karma according to the Hindu faith.&nbsp; I must admit that my first impulse was to quickly respond, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>Now wait a minute!&nbsp;  My religion is just as strict and austere as yours!&nbsp; Don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
t tell me we let people off too easily!<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64; </font>
  The strictness of the law had suddenly become a matter of pride.&nbsp; I had not yet come boldly <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 or humbly <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 to the throne of Grace.&nbsp; I have now learned better.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It is important for us to know also that the God of Condescension is still at work.&nbsp; One of the most comforting passages in all of scripture is found in the Doctrine &amp; Covenants 45: 3-5, where Jesus, the God of Condescension, teaches us what it means for him to be our advocate:</p>
<p align="LEFT">Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#66;</font>
 Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased: behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified;</p>
<p align="LEFT">Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life </p>
<p align="LEFT">Notice here, that in addition to the use of the present 
    perfect tense of the verb (<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>pleading<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>), we see that, in making a case 
    s for us before our Father, Christ refers to no principle, to no abstraction or law.&nbsp; Rather, he makes reference to the concrete act performed by him as an act of pure condescension in the same world in which we live and sin.&nbsp;  No merely abstract, detached deity can do this for us.</p>
<p align="LEFT">We who have the restored gospel are blessed to know more about the atonement and what it felt like than any other people (see Doctrine and Covenants 19:13-20).&nbsp; Every Christian can read the account in the New testament.&nbsp; We learn much of the God of Condescension from these accounts.&nbsp;  We learn that as the weight of the sins of mankind began to distill upon him he was <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>sore amazed<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Mark 14:33).&nbsp; Surely he had not known what this felt like.&nbsp; In the midst of his suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, from Luke<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s account (Luke 22:39-45),  he prayed fervently that the cup of suffering might be taken, but he prayed also to do the Father<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s will.&nbsp; We are told also that <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>there appeared an angel from heaven, strengthening him<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 (Luke 22:43).&nbsp; May I submit that no abstraction could possibly have motivated such suffering.&nbsp; No commitment, however strong to any abstraction could have sustained him.&nbsp; What comfort he received came not from principle but from a real being sent from God, giving him strength, perhaps to suffer yet more.&nbsp; We have the same promise.&nbsp; Only Christ<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>s knowing us, and loving us, and his love for the Father, could have motivated and sustained him through such suffering as this.&nbsp; Only a concrete act by an immortal God with feelings could have generated the breadth and power of feeling sufficient to bring about mercy great and real enough to encircle us all.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As I have struggled to come to know the God of Condescension, I have been struck by something I had known conceptually, but which had  never entered my heart.&nbsp; We know by all accounts that Christ entered the Garden of Gethsemane to pray alone three times.&nbsp; What I had not noticed was that twice he re-entered Gethsemane knowing perfectly well what it felt like.&nbsp;  He went back with full knowledge of the pain.&nbsp; Such was the perfection of his condescension.&nbsp; 
May we know this God, and love him.&nbsp; Of him I bear testimony and offer it 
in his holy name.&nbsp; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: -20px">It is a pleasure to return to this remarkable institution where a part of our heart and choice memories have been for years.&nbsp;  While we were here, we grew to love the students, faculty, staff, and community.&nbsp;  The focus here in the past, present, and future has been, is, and will continue to be on students<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>on providing you with the finest college educational opportunities and environment anywhere available<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>and I mean <i>anywhere</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">We have watched from a distance<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>often from a very long distance<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>the continued growth and development of Ricks College under President Bennion<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s leadership, and now, through this period of <i>revolutionary</i> change, the growth and progress into Brigham Young University<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>Idaho, under President Bednar<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s leadership.&nbsp; We commend all of you.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Years ago, when we had the privilege of being on this campus, we dreamed of the day when the administrative offices could be moved from the McKay Building and thus allow the library to expand.  We are grateful that day has come, and among the new facilities are other magnificent buildings named for some of my heroes: Presidents John Taylor, Spencer W. Kimball, and Gordon B. Hinckley.  What great examples!</p>
<p align="LEFT">For more than 100 years, under inspired prophetic guidance, Church leaders have concentrated remarkable efforts and resources on students to provide them with morally- and spiritually-based education.  How blessed we are!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Today, what I have to share with you relates to the major emphasis latter-day prophets, from the beginning to the present, have placed on temples and temple worship.  I will include some of the chronological history of that development and then highlight the expulsion from Nauvoo and what the reconstruction of the Nauvoo temple means to us today.  Finally, and very importantly, I would like to emphasize our individual responsibility to place more of our personal emphasis on temples and temple worship.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Chronologically, section 2 of the Doctrine and Covenants is the earliest section received by the Prophet Joseph Smith.  It comes from the Angel Moroni<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s appearance in 1823, more than six years before the Church was organized.  In it, we read:</p>
<p align="LEFT">Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood [that is, the sealing power of the priesthood which functions in temples], by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If it were not so,<b> the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming</b> (Doctrine and Covenants 2:1<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">B</font>3, emphasis added).</p>
<p align="LEFT">In other words, without those sealing keys to bind families together for the eternities, the purpose of the whole earth<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s existence would be wasted, or not achieved.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The most recent section added to the Doctrine and Covenants, section 138, the <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Vision of the Redemption of the Dead,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> which was received by President Joseph F. Smith in 1918, also deals with the sacred work that is accomplished only within the temples of the Church.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Before a year had passed following the formal organization of the Church in April 1830, the Prophet Joseph Smith received a revelation that contained this declaration, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God; wherefore, gird up your loins and I will suddenly come to my temple<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> (Doctrine and Covenants 36:8).  At that time, no temple existed on the earth to which He could come.  But shortly thereafter, the Lord revealed that a temple should be constructed:</p>
<p align="LEFT">Now here is wisdom, and the mind of the Lord<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>let the house be built, not after the manner of the world, for I give not unto you that ye shall live after the manner of the world;</p>
<p align="LEFT">Therefore, let it be built after the manner which I shall show unto three of you, whom ye shall appoint and ordain unto this power (Doctrine and Covenants 95:13-14).</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the subsequent, impoverished years, and with relatively few members, the Kirtland, Ohio Temple was constructed and finally dedicated March 27, 1836.  In comparable terms, that accomplishment would be something like having one of your stake presidents here at BYU<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">B</font>Idaho receive the assignment to build a temple.  The numbers of people involved and, in many cases, even your ages would be somewhat similar to theirs.  That project would mean not just raising the money and writing checks, but actually making the plans, quarrying and hauling the stone, finding skilled people who could lead, and then, with your own hands, doing the work.   Considering the time, place, population, and poverty of the people, the Kirtland Temple was possibly the most costly building the Church has ever built in terms of personal sacrifice, effort, and resources.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the temple was finished and dedicated, the Lord did come to accept it just one week later, on April 3, 1836.  Other prophets also appeared, including Elijah who came as prophesied and restored the sealing keys of the Priesthood (see Doctrine and Covenants 110).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Church members didn<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t use the Kirtland Temple for long because before much more than a year had passed, the Prophet Joseph and many Church members were forced to flee for their lives to the Church<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s secondary settling area in Missouri (Have you noticed that so often they were forced to flee in winter?).</p>
<p align="LEFT">While in Missouri, Church members laid the cornerstones of two other temples, which were never built because of intense persecution and, finally, Governor Boggs<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font> extermination order, which made members of the Church <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>fair game.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  Forced to flee for their lives<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>once again in winter<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>they trudged back to and crossed the Mississippi River, eventually arriving at the swampy, malaria-infested area of Commerce which later, as a result of their efforts, became a beautiful city named Nauvoo<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">CA</font>Nauvoo the Beautiful.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@
</font></p>
<p align="LEFT">Almost immediately, when the Prophet Joseph was permitted to escape from his six-month incarceration in the dungeon of Liberty Jail (what a name: <i>Liberty</i> Jail!), he joined the Saints in Nauvoo and turned their attention once again to the construction of a temple.  The Lord revealed the following to the Prophet Joseph on August 31, 1840: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>The time has now come, when it is necessary to erect a house of prayer, a house of order, a house for the worship of our God where the ordinances can be attended to agreeably to His divine will<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> <i>(History of the Church </i>4:186).</p>
<p align="LEFT">During the October general conference of that same year, the proposal to build a temple was enthusiastically and unanimously endorsed by the members of the Church.</p>
<p align="LEFT">William Weeks was designated to be the architect to draw the plans, under Joseph<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s inspired direction, and they proceeded with the construction of the Nauvoo Temple, which, in my opinion, was the <i>second-most</i> expensive building the Church has ever built<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>again, in terms of individual sacrifice, effort, and resources.  They had to find and quarry the stone, locate and cut the thousands of board feet of timbers, which they found 500 miles upstream in the state of Wisconsin, and float them down the Mississippi River to be shaped and fashioned.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">It was a time of immense sacrifice and toil.  President Hinckley reminded us that the members were tithed, not just once, but<i> three</i> times:  one-tenth of all they possessed, one-tenth of their increase, and then one-tenth of their time to work on the construction of the building.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Nauvoo Temple construction attracted such attention that often several river boats loaded with curious non-member onlookers would come to see such a rare phenomenon as that beautiful building rising on that bend in the river on the western frontier of America.  Most had never seen anything like it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This monumental effort to build the House of the Lord occurred while enemies from Missouri and elsewhere continually threatened Joseph<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s life.  When mobsters from Missouri or wherever pursued the Prophet Joseph, he sought refuge in one place or another.  In Nauvoo, we are told that occasionally it was up through a trap door into the small attic of the home of Bishop Edward Hunter.  Joseph Smith was over six feet tall, and while he was in that cramped and life-threatening situation, his mind was occupied with things more important to him than his personal safety.  Without even being able to stand up for hours on end, it was there in that uncomfortable setting, he wrote letters of inspiration, one of which became section 128 in the Doctrine and Covenants.  Listen to what was pressing on his mind at the time:  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>I now resume the subject of the baptism for the dead, as that subject seems to occupy my mind, and press itself upon my feelings the strongest, since I have been pursued by my enemies<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> (Doctrine and Covenants 128:1).  Rather than to his own comfort and safety, his thoughts turned to the sacred ordinance work that would occur in the temple.  Rather than being discouraged or depressed, he wrote positive, optimistic and even lyrical lines such as these: </p>
<p align="LEFT">Now what do we hear in the gospel which we have received?  A voice of gladness!  A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the earth; glad tidings for the dead; glad tidings of great joy.  How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things, and that say unto Zion:  Behold, thy God reigneth!  As the dews of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of God descend upon them!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! (Doctrine and Covenants 128:19,22).</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the same year of 1842, Joseph received a true intimation that he may not be alive when the temple was completed, and he invited some leaders to the second floor of the Red Brick Store where he had his office. There he shared with them the ordinances associated with the endowment (<i>History of the Church</i> 5:1<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">B</font>2).</p>
<p align="LEFT">While the construction was yet in progress, he and his brother Hyrum were murdered in the Carthage Jail in 1844.  Although mourning the loss of their leaders Church members continued their efforts, under the guidance of President Brigham Young, to finish the temple so they could <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>be endowed with power from on high<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> (Doctrine and Covenants 105:11) and receive their sacred temple blessings.  Much of this effort was carried out even though they knew that they would not be able to remain in Nauvoo for long.</p>
<p align="LEFT">By late December 1845, the Nauvoo Temple was completed sufficiently so that the blessings of the endowment could be bestowed.  During this time Church members were being forced out of the area by mobs<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>once again in winter.   But right up to the last moment, the temple was in full use.  President Brigham Young recorded the following in his journal on February 3, 1846: </p>
<p align="LEFT">Notwithstanding that I had announced that we would not attend to the administration of the ordinances, the House of the Lord was thronged all day, the anxiety being so great to receive, ...the endowments until our way was hedged up, and our enemies intercept us. But I informed the brethren that this was not wise,...that I was going to get my wagons started, and be off.  I walked some distance from the Temple, supposing the crowd would disperse, but on returning I found the House filled to overflowing.  Looking upon the multitude and knowing their anxiety, as they were thirsting and hungering for the word.... we continued at work diligently in the House of the Lord.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Then they were forced to leave.  An entry from one of the member<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s diary adds to the sorrow of the scene. It reads:</p>
<p align="LEFT">The top of this hill was the last point from which I could see the Nauvoo temple. I have no words with which to convey a proper conception of my feelings when taking a last look at this sacred monument of the living faith of the Saints, and which was associated in their minds with the heavenly and holy. After the lapse of thirty-six years I can scarcely restrain my feelings when I write of it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Elder Wilford Woodruff wrote:</p>
<p align="LEFT">The work in Nauvoo was done. Henceforth the city of the Saints was to be nothing more to them than a memory until God should determine otherwise. It brought its joys; but its history was also full of sad reminiscences, apostasy, murderous intent, and destruction.</p>
<p align="LEFT">I was in Nauvoo on the 26th day of May, 1846, for the last time, and left the city of the Saints feeling that most likely I was taking a final farewell of Nauvoo for this life. I looked back upon the Temple and City as they receded from view and asked the Lord to remember the sacrifices of his Saints (E. Cecil McGavin, <i>Nauvoo the Beautiful </i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1972], 223).</p>
<p align="LEFT">After all those years of toil, sacrifice, and anticipation, the temple was in use <i>no more than eight weeks</i> before the embattled and harassed members formed that trail of tears down Parley Street to the Mississippi River.  Many even left the doors of their homes unlocked, forsaking all their material possessions except for what could be carried in a wagon box, and many, with their families, crossed the frozen Mississippi on ice into Iowa and the unknown.   </p>
<p align="LEFT">That beautiful Nauvoo Temple was destroyed by fire, set by an arsonist in 1848, and two years later, a tornado toppled the remaining walls.  Fortunately, several thousand members had received the blessings of the endowment before leaving the city, and I am confident that the blessings of their sacred temple covenants made with the Lord helped them face and overcome the trials that lay ahead.  But, many additional thousands who crossed the plains in subsequent months did not have the opportunity of receiving their temple blessings and endowments in Nauvoo and they longed for the opportunity.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Nauvoo, once so vibrant and progressive, literally, almost from one month to the next, became a ghost town.  In the late summer of August in 1846, Col. Thomas L. Kane, a special friend to the Church, acquired a small boat on the Iowa side and rowed across the Mississippi River to the main landing wharf at Nauvoo and visited what he called <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>the deserted city.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@
</font></p>
<p align="LEFT">In a speech Col. Kane delivered to the Pennsylvania Historical Society in 1850, he shared some of his experience on that visit.  Picture in your imaginations the scene he observed:</p>
<p align="LEFT">No one met me there. I looked and saw no one. I could hear no one move;...the quiet everywhere was such that I heard the flies buzz, ... I walked through solitary streets...I went about unchecked. I went into empty workshops,...The spinner's wheel was idle; the carpenter had gone from his workbench and shavings,... The blacksmith's shop was cold; but his coal heap and ladling pool, and crooked water horn were all there, as if he had just gone off for a holiday... No one called out to me from any opened window, or dog sprang forward to bark an alarm. . . . The doors were unfastened; and when at last I timidly entered them, I found dead ashes white upon the hearths, and [felt as though I] <i>had to tread a-tiptoe, as if walking down the aisle of a country church,...
</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">[For me as a farmer, this next part is especially gripping:]</p>
<p align="LEFT">Fields upon fields of heavy-headed yellow grain lay rotting ungathered upon the ground. No one was at hand to take in their rich harvest. As far as the eye could reach, they stretched away<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>they sleeping too in the hazy air of autumn (William Mulder, <i>BYU Studies</i> vol. 32 (1992), nos. 1<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">B</font>2, 115<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">B</font>16, emphasis added).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Thus, they left Nauvoo and thousands were to die along the trail west.  As most of you know, the first Latter-day Saint pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847.  To any of us with farming experience in this part of the west, we know that the end of July is harvest time, not planting time.  The pioneers worked feverishly to plant seeds with the hope of harvesting some kind of crops in a very short growing season before the arrival of frost and snow.  And, to that point, they had no homes built to shelter them and their families from the approaching winter.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">In spite of these difficult, and even life-threatening circumstances, four days after their arrival into the valley (and I repeat, <i>four </i>days after their arrival), in the dry, dusty heat of that July afternoon, President Brigham Young took some of the leaders on an exploratory excursion around the valley and, placing the tip of his cane in the ground, declared, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Here we will build a temple to our God.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> (And, did they ever! <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>The walls of solid granite rise from sixteen feet wide at the base and taper to six feet wide at the square with those beautiful six spires above, which someone has described as <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>poetry in stone.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>)  Elder Wilford Woodruff reportedly drove a stake to mark the spot where the Temple was to be built and the city and streets were laid out from that point.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Speaking of <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>poetry in stone,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> do you remember during the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics the frequent television reports of who had won whatever the event was by so many hundredths of a second, and over the shoulder of the commentator, the view of those six spires of the Salt Lake Temple?  This most recognized symbol of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in all the world was visible to an estimated one-half of the population of the earth.  For me, the coming of the Olympics to Salt Lake City was at least a <i>partial</i> fulfillment of Isaiah<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s prophecy: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> (Isaiah 2:2).</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the October conference of 1849, Addison Pratt, James Brown, and Hyrum H. Blackwell were called to the Society Islands to preach the gospel.  Since Elder Pratt had not received his endowment and there was no temple building in which to administer it, on October 21, President Brigham Young dedicated the top of Ensign Peak, just north of where the Utah State Capitol building now stands, and the first recorded endowment administered in the territory was received there.  President Brigham Young left a record of the event: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Addison Pratt received his endowments on Ensign Hill on the 21<sup>st</sup>,  the place being consecrated for that purpose<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> (quoted in B. H. Roberts, <i>A Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</i> 6 vols. [Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1930], 3:386).</p>
<p align="LEFT">(As many of you in this audience know, to this day, wherever and whenever possible, Church leaders have wanted all who have the privilege of serving as full-time missionaries to have received their endowment blessings <i>before</i> going into the mission field.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">The first semi-permanent building in the valley was the Old Council House which was completed in 1852.  It was constructed on the southwest corner of Main Street and South Temple.  The fourth floor was dedicated for the purpose of bestowing the endowments and so for the first time under a roof since the expulsion from Nauvoo, endowments were administered by Heber C. Kimball, counselor in the First Presidency, under direction from President Brigham Young.  These endowments began on July 7, 1852.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Endowment House was completed and dedicated on the northwest corner of what is now Temple Square on May 5, 1855 and it was there for the next many years the members of the Church received their endowments and live sealing blessings.  My own Danish immigrant grandparents were sealed there in 1883.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The St. George Temple was finished and dedicated on April 6, 1877.  At that time, President Brigham Young commissioned Elder Wilford Woodruff and others to put into writing the temple endowment and ordinances.  Until then, the endowment had been administered by memory.  When they finished that assignment, President Brigham Young said: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Now you have before you an ensample, to carry on the endowments in all the temples until the coming of the Son of Man<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  (Wilford Woodruff, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>History of the St. George Temple: Its Cost and Dedication and the Labor Thereon,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> in David Henry Cannon, Collection, 1883<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">B</font>1924, Historical Department Archives, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Logan Temple was dedicated in 1884 (My parents were sealed there many years later) and the Manti Temple was dedicated in 1888.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Since the Endowment House was ordered demolished in 1889 by President Wilford Woodruff during the difficult days of persecution due to plural marriage, and the Salt Lake Temple was not dedicated until 1893, in the intervening years, Church members in the Salt Lake Valley had to make the long trip to Logan, Manti, or St. George to attend to their temple responsibilities.  To indicate how far the Church has progressed, now in Salt Lake City, we have six temples within less than an hour<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s drive.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Clearly, the administrations of Presidents Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and their successors were marked by a resolute emphasis on temples and the ordinances available therein.  When the history of President Hinckley<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s administration of the Church is written, what do you suppose will be included as a major focus of his efforts?  Unmistakably and clearly, it will be the construction of temples and the effort to bring them closer to the members of the Church.  It is now estimated that 80% of the members of the Church now live within a two-hour drive of a temple!  What a remarkable development!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Do you remember when President Hinckley surprised us all at the conclusion of the April Conference of 1999 with the announcement that the Nauvoo Temple would be reconstructed?   From that date until the Nauvoo Temple was dedicated last June 27, 2002, as near as possible to the very hour of the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum, and in just over three years, <i>fifty-six other temples scattered around the world were completed and dedicated</i>!  Who could deny that that is a <i>major </i>emphasis?  What a remarkable and blessed era we live in.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To illustrate how the Lord works through young missionaries, such as many of you, as well as through his living prophets, I would like to share something of the history of the architectural plans of the Nauvoo Temple, how they were preserved for more than 100 years and eventually came into possession of the Church and which the Church had at the time President Hinckley made that surprising announcement that it would be reconstructed.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">As mentioned before, Brother William Weeks was commissioned as the architect and when the saints were driven from Nauvoo, he brought the plans with him.  Not many years after they arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, some kind of conflict arose between him and President Brigham Young.  William Weeks left the Church and took his family and the architectural plans to California.  As a result of his defection, his entire posterity grew up outside the Church and its blessings.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Incidentally and parenthetically, there is a message there for all of us about the importance of our remaining faithful to our covenants and what can happen to us and those who follow us if we do not.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In 1948, more than 100 years since the plans were drawn, young Elder Vern Thacker of Charleston, up by Heber City, Utah, in Wasatch County, and his companion, were serving as missionaries like many of you have served or will serve.  They were doing their duty knocking on doors one very hot and dry day in the little town of Boron, California, way out in the Mojave Desert.  I think it was more than a coincidence that they made contact with a Mr. Leslie Griffin, who at that time was almost seventy years of age.   He told them that he was a grandson of William Weeks, the architect.  Just before Elder Thacker was to be released and return to his home, Mr. Griffin went to a back room in his house and brought out the roll of the original architectural plans for the Nauvoo Temple.  Brother Thacker described the roll as being about three or four feet long and ten inches in diameter.  They were the original plans which had been handed down from one generation to another in his family.  He requested that Elder Thacker take them to Church headquarters since he and his family agreed that it would be more appropriate for the Church to have them.   Elder Thacker tucked them in the trunk of his 1935 Ford coupe and brought them to Church headquarters.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">As a result, more than fifty years later, when President Hinckley made the announcement of the re-construction of the Nauvoo Temple, the plans were in possession of the Church and thus it could be restored on the original site and as near its original external appearance as possible.</p>
<p align="LEFT">I<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>ve thought it providential that those plans were physically located for all those years in the area of the dry climate of the Mojave Desert rather than in some humid area of the country where they may not have survived in as good a condition as they were.  There is no question in my mind that the Lord<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s hand was in it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">(A little aside to this whole story is that Vern Thacker used to date my wife, Barbara.  I have always been pleased that he got the plans and I got Barbara.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">The sturdily reconstructed Nauvoo Temple stands today as a tangible monument reminding us, and the entire world, of the sacrifices of the Prophet Joseph Smith and all those faithful early Church members.  The temple is there not just as a monument but as an active temple in which these sacred ordinances are once again blessing the lives of those on both sides of the veil.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Now, what does all this mean for us, and you, particularly, as students here at this great institution of BYU-Idaho?</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 1. We should recognize that from the time of the restoration of the Gospel, temples and temple worship have been and are a major emphasis of <i>all </i>the prophets from Joseph Smith to Gordon B. Hinckley.</p>
<p align="LEFT">2. We must understand that the presence of temples and the work performed in temples is essential in the restored gospel.  The Lord warned the early Saints that if they did not build a temple in which to do the work for the dead, that they would be <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>rejected as a church<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> (Doctrine and Covenants 124:32).</p>
<p align="LEFT">3. We should remember that we are instructed by the leaders of the Church to attend the temple as frequently as our circumstances permit.  The Lord places the responsibility directly on our shoulders.  By policy, there is no reporting system or any quotas imposed on us institutionally.  But, what does it mean to attend the temple <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>as frequently as circumstances permit?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  That frequency will vary with each person and each person<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s circumstances.  For me, I would not be surprised if some day at the judgment bar questions like this were to be asked of me: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Joe, how close did you live to a temple?  Was your life in order so you could obtain a temple recommend?  Did you have transportation or the means necessary to make the trip?  Were you in good enough health?  Could you possibly have better organized your time?  How many hours did you spend watching television, attending athletic events, playing golf, traveling for pleasure?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  Good questions, every one.</p>
<p align="LEFT">4. As members of the Church today, we have major responsibilities related to the temple and family history.  In the last October general conference, in his opening address, which he entitled, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Oh That I Were an Angel, and Could Have the Wish of Mine Heart,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> President Hinckley urged us to <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>utilize the temples of the Church.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  He counseled:</p>
<p align="LEFT">Go there and carry forward the great and marvelous work which the God of heaven has outlined for us. There let us learn of His ways and His plans. There let us make covenants that will lead us in paths of righteousness, unselfishness, and truth. There let us be joined as families under an eternal covenant administered under the authority of the priesthood of God.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And there may we extend these same blessings to those of previous generations, even our own forebears who await the service which we can now give.</p>
<p align="LEFT">May the blessings of heaven rest upon you, my beloved brethren and sisters.  May the Spirit of Elijah touch your hearts and prompt you to do that work for others who cannot move forward unless you do so. May we rejoice in the glorious privilege that is ours</p>
<p align="LEFT">Very likely, many of you in this audience have, in your wallet or purse, a current temple recommend, which, in my opinion, is the most precious little piece of paper one could possess.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some of you have not yet been endowed because you have not yet been on a mission or have not yet married.  Nevertheless, remember these words from President Howard W. Hunter, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>We hope that <i>every</i> adult member of the Church is worthy of and carries a current temple recommend. <i>Even our young people can qualify to receive a temple recommend to do baptisms for the dead</i><font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  (see, <i>The Teachings of Howard W. Hunter</i>, p. 240. Italics added).  That counsel includes every member of the Church in this audience.  Prepare yourselves for receiving a temple recommend by keeping yourselves clean and worthy, by studying the gospel and striving to have the Spirit with you.  Use your recommend.  Go to the temple as often as your circumstances permit and you will be more able to learn and understand the truths that are taught there.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">Some few of you may not now have a current temple recommend, either for baptisms for the dead or for the other ordinances of the temple.  Where that is the case, I urge you to do everything in your power to make whatever adjustments are necessary in your life in order to obtain one.  Where necessary, repent fully and turn again to the Lord.  A temple recommend indicates that in the opinion of those we sustain as our <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>judges in Israel,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@C</font>our bishop and stake president<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">C</font>we are living a committed, faithful, healthy, clean, and moral life. </p>
<p align="LEFT">My sister, just older than I, set for me a very powerful example.  For many years, she had been the main caregiver for my brother-in-law who had multiple sclerosis and whose body had come to the point that he required almost around-the-clock care.  One day, my sister was not feeling well, so she went for an appointment with her doctor.  Stomach cancer was diagnosed.  It had spread from her stomach to her liver and other abdominal organs.  It was inoperable, and she was told that she likely had a very short time to live.  She never returned home again.  During the weeks she was in the hospital, her temple recommend expired.   </p>
<p align="LEFT">When it appeared that she had just a few days left to live, while visiting with her Latter-day Saint cancer specialist she said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>I would like to be buried with a current temple recommend.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> </p>
<p align="LEFT">He replied, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>I don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t think they use them over there.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> </p>
<p align="LEFT">A</p>
<p align="LEFT">Her bishop and stake president came and interviewed her.  She passed away a few days later and she was buried with a current temple recommend.</p>
<p align="LEFT">With that example, I hope and intend to do the same.  I always want to live in such a way that I will be able to look my bishop and stake president in the eye and answer their questions honestly and appropriately.  I always want to have in my possession a current temple recommend, and, as we are counseled by our leaders, to use it <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>as frequently as circumstances permit.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@
</font></p>
<p align="LEFT">May the Lord<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s richest blessings continue to be with all of us to this end.  I testify that our Heavenly Father lives.  He knows each of us by name.  Jesus is the Christ and this is His Church led by living prophets.  The <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>keys to the kingdom,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> which the Lord gave to His apostles in New Testament times <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>to bind on earth that which will be bound in heaven,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> have been restored to the earth in our day and function in the 114 temples currently in operation (see Matthew 16:13-19).  To me, the most satisfying doctrine in our faith is that the love that exists between husbands and wives and parents and children was meant by the Lord to last forever.  This is my testimony, which I share with you humbly and sincerely, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: -20px"> &nbsp;</p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: -20px"> &nbsp;</p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: -20px"> In Washington D.C., on a small island in the middle of the Potomac River is the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial.  Part of  that memorial is a 17 foot high bronze statue of Theodore Roosevelt in front of a 30 foot high shaft of granite.  Roosevelt was the 26th president of the United States serving from 1901 to 1909.  On a surrounding  terrace there are four large granite tablets, each of which is engraved with  statements of Roosevelt<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s philosophy of citizenship.  On one of those tablets is the sentence:  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>It is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  For each of us, it is important to do the very best we can with what we have.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">Theodore Roosevelt was not only a statesman and a politician; but he was also an outdoorsman, an author, a naturalist, a rancher, an athlete, and a naval historian.  He loved to <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>do<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> things and to <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>try<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> things.  For example, he enjoyed seeing how far he could walk in a straight line without being stopped by something.  Even while president of the United States, he would try this taking along with him any one he could get to accompany him.  He would go to Rock Creek Park, a public park in the center of Washington D.C. marked by a stream, ponds, ravines, cliffs, forests, underbrush, etc.  Theodore Roosevelt and those who came with him would walk, wade, swim, descend, scale, and push through whatever confronted them until something absolutely stopped them.  They thrived on going as far as they could and the next time trying to go even farther.  It reminds me of the motto of the high school our daughter attended, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>I shall find a way or I shall make one!<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  After Theodore Roosevelt completed his terms as president of the United States, he gave a speech at the Sorbonne in France.  In doing so, he talked about the benefits of getting involved and doing your best.  He said this, </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.  The credit belongs to the man in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly . . . who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who have never known neither victory nor
  defeat.</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<p align="LEFT">This was a continual theme of Roosevelt<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s life. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Inability To Do the Perfect Thing
</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Ofttimes I found as a young man I was fearful to do things because I wasn<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t ready or felt that I could not do the perfect thing.  I remember reading a comment from the Bengalense poet, Rabindranath Tagore, in which he said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>I have spent my days in stringing and unstringing my instrument while the song I came to sing remains unsung.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  Sometimes we find ourselves doing that.  We can prepare and prepare and prepare but never act.  As a young lawyer when I was being sworn in to practice before the Federal District Court for Utah, Judge A. Sherman Christensen, the federal judge, gave a group of us some advice. In doing so he said this:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Preparation is a wonderful comfort and a wonderful strength.  As William Feather said: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&gt;</font>Too many of us wait to do the perfect thing, with the result we do nothing.  While many of us are waiting until conditions are <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&gt;</font>just right<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font> before we go ahead, others are moving along, fortunately ignorant of the dangers that beset them.  By the time that we in our superior wisdom decide to make a start, we discover that the fools have traveled far.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font></i> </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Unwillingness To Push Ourselves To Our Limits
</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sometimes we are reluctant to challenge ourselves or to get involved.  A woman named Myrtle Cook from Toronto, Canada, won the 100 yard gold medal at the Olympics in 1928.  She was asked by an interviewer named Laurier Lapierre, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A&gt;</font>What do you think about when you are poised at the starting line waiting for the signal?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>  She replied: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&gt;</font>You just think: run as fast as you
can.'&quot;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; That is what we need to do.  We need to figuratively run as fast as we can.  We are familiar with the scripture that says, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>. . . [I]t is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> (Mosiah 4:27).  Sometimes we over look the next sentence, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore all things must be done in order.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  We should not be afraid to be willing to regularly test ourselves and run as fast as we can with the hope that we can increase our ability to run even faster.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Concern That Others Can Do Something Better Than We Can
</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sometimes we are afraid to get involved because we think others can do something better than we can.  In the play, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Waiting For Godot,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> two men hearing cries for help weigh the risks of giving assistance.&nbsp;  As they do so, this dialogue takes place between them: </p>
<p align="LEFT">Let us not waste our time in idle discourse! Let us do 
something, while we have the chance! It is not everyday that we are needed. Not 
indeed that we are personally needed. Others would meet the case equally well, 
if not better. To all mankind they were addressed, those cries for help still 
ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is 
us, whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it, before it is too 
late!<sup>3</sup> </p>
<p align="LEFT"> You will each be in situations where you are asked to do something you feel others could do better, but at that particular time and that particular place <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>all mankind<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> may well be you; and if you don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t do what needs to be done, it won<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t get done.  Wherever you find yourself  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>make the most of it before it is too late.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  Don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t be afraid to get involved.  </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Possibility of Embarrassment
</b> </p>
<p align="LEFT">If you are doing your best, don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t be afraid to be embarrassed.  President Faust, when he was a bishop, had an experience with being asked to sing in the ward choir.  In a biography of President Faust, he was quoted as saying about this experience: </p>
<p align="LEFT">We had a good choir because our leader, Brother Alex Anderson, was a good leader. He, however, encouraged the bishop to sing in the choir. I felt that as a measure of support for Brother Anderson and the others. . . I would try to sing with the choir. Things went from bad to worse. Brother Anderson liked to invite the choir members to improve their talents by singing solos. One Sunday during choir practice he asked that the bishop sing a small solo. I found it very difficult to turn Brother Anderson down in front of the choir when the others who were not very good singers made a 100 percent effort. So during sacrament meeting they sang and I tried. I was literally so frightened and upset that the paper trembled in my hands. I could hardly hold it. I felt embarrassed and I felt humiliated. All of my mask of dignity was gone. After the meeting as I walked down the aisle I was met with warm smiles and expressions of understanding and support. Someone said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&gt;</font>Bishop, it surely makes us feel good to see you scared.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font> That day the bishop became more human. </p>
<p align="LEFT">President Faust<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s biographer commented:</p>
<p align="LEFT">In reflecting on that day years later, he would add, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&gt;</font>Instead of thinking you have to do everything perfectly as a leader, you do the best you can. And sometimes when you're doing the best you can, you find that you can't do everything as well as you'd like. But people are forgiving of our weaknesses and shortcomings, and they don't expect us to be perfect, especially when we're willing to laugh at ourselves and admit we're human.'<sup>4</sup><i> </i></p>
<p align="LEFT">We may fall short.  We may not do things perfectly; but if we do the best we can with what we have, the Lord will take it into account.  Brigham Young said, </p>
<p align="LEFT">We all occupy diversified stations in the world, and in the kingdom of God. Those who do right, and seek the glory of the Father in heaven, whether their knowledge be little or much, or whether they can do little or much, if they do the very best they know how, they are perfect. . . .<sup>5</sup></p>
<p align="LEFT">On the occasion of the dedication of the Gordon B. Hinckley Building here at BYU Idaho on October 22, 2002, President Hinckley said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>You don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t have to be a genius.  You don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t have to be a straight-A student.  You just have to do your very best with all the capability you have.  You have to do your very best.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  This phrase,  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>. . . do your very best with all the capability you have. . . .<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  influenced me in choosing the subject for today<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s remarks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">What each of us <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>knows<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> is one of the important things we have to offer the world.  When George Washington was a surveyor in his early years, he is said to have delivered a bill for $5 dollars for surveying a client<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s real estate.  The client objected thinking the bill was excessive.  <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>All you did is drive in four stakes,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> the client protested.  Washington asked for the bill back, wadded it up and threw it away, took out a piece of paper and wrote on it and then handed it to the client.  On the new piece of paper it said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Driving four stakes $1.00.  Knowing where to drive the stakes $4.00.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  I don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t remember the exact amounts charged in this situation, but the point is made and the principle established.  What you know increases your ability to make a meaningful contribution.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">Richard Rogers, the composer of the music for such Broadway hits as Oklahoma, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I, and The Sound of Music was quoted in his obituary in <i>Time Magazine</i> as saying, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A&gt;</font>When the lyrics are right, it<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s easier for me to write a tune than to bend over and tie my shoelaces.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font> . . . When Oscar Hammerstein II handed him the lyric for Bali Ha<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>i, Rogers studied it for a moment, then turned the typed page over, retired to the next room and five minutes later came back with the completed melody, one of his most haunting.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><sup>6</sup> </p>
<p align="LEFT">The writer of Rogers<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font> obituary went on to say: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>His seemingly spontaneous outpourings belied a sustained discipline, as he readily acknowledged: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&gt;</font>It<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s the result of years of living, of study and reading, of personality and temperament.  At one particular moment all these come together and, the artist <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>expresses<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> himself.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=@</font><sup>7</sup><font face="WP TypographicSymbols">
</font></p>
<p align="LEFT">The better we prepare ourselves, the more we have to have offer the world.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At this point, you may be wondering what it is that you  know and what it is that you can do?  When I was perhaps a little younger than you, a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood before my mission, my senior companion and I were assigned to home teach, among other persons, Elder Delbert Stapley of the Quorum of the Twelve and his family.  This was in Salt Lake City; and when you home taught in those days,  you could just walk through the neighborhood and knock on doors.  Our arrangement was that we would alternate teaching the lessons at every other home.  In those days, you had a fixed lesson you were to teach and a written summary of the lesson that you left with the family when you had completed your visit.  As we would go out, I would try to estimate whether it would be my turn to knock on Elder Stapley<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s door or whether it would be my companion<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s turn, always hoping that he would have to teach the discussion when we arrived at the Stapley home.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">The first time I ended up having to teach the Stapley family, the assigned lesson was temple marriage.  I agonized walking to their house, thinking that I really had no ability or knowledge to teach such a discussion.  After we were in the home and my senior companion had talked briefly with Elder Stapley and his family, he turned to me and said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Brother West will now teach us about temple marriage.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  I, in a halting way, said to Elder Stapley, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>You are married and I am not, and I understand that as an Apostle you are in the temple at least weekly for a meeting, and I am sure you are also there several other times each month in various capacities.  I have never been to the temple so I don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t know how I can teach you anything about temple marriage.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  Now, fifty years later, I don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t remember exactly the words he said, or the examples he used, or the specific members of his family; but the conversation went something like this.  Elder Stapley looked straight at me and said pointing to his wife, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>This is my wife.  She is a wonderful woman, but she wants to further develop some of her homemaking skills.  Notwithstanding that I am a member of the Twelve, I can<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t teach her those things.  For that type of information I am relying on the women of the Relief Society.  This is my son.  He is a Scout.  I am a member of the Quorum of the Twelve and have to travel throughout the world.  I can<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t be here all the time to train him on the many things he needs to know to obtain merit badges, nor can I  be involved in some of the other things he needs to progress in Scouting.  If the Scout master and the merit badge counselors don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t fulfill their callings, I am afraid that he will not be an Eagle Scout.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> </p>
<p align="LEFT">He then turned to other members of his family with similar examples always pointing out how those who had callings within the ward, sometimes naming them by name, would need to be responsible for fulfilling their callings so that members of his family could progress. He then turned to me and said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Now you are our home teacher; and if you and your companion don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t give us the home teaching discussions, no one will.  Therefore, teach us about temple marriage.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  I stumbled through a discussion on temple marriage.  At the end, as I remember it, Elder Stapley looked at me and said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Now I can<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t say that I learned much from that discussion but you did, didn<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t you?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  I replied, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Yes, sir.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  He then said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Now  you and your companion will be our home teachers, and we expect you to give us lessons each time you come so plan to be prepared and give us the lessons.  I<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>m sure they will be of some benefit to us and certainly of some benefit to you,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> and he was right!  In future months as I presented lessons, I don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t know how much the Stapley family learned, but I learned a great deal trying to be as prepared as I could.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Lehi sent Nephi on what was an intimidating assignment for him when he sent Nephi to get the brass plates from Laban with these words: </p>
<p align="LEFT">. . . [T]he Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord, because thou hast not murmured.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p align="LEFT">As we listen to those verses, we can almost hear the Primary song lyrics, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>I will go <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">B</font> and do <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">B</font> for I know.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> </p>
<p align="LEFT">We are often given responsibilities for which we feel inadequately prepared. We have heard the wonderful statement by President Thomas S. Monson who said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Whom God calls, God qualifies,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><sup>9</sup> and I know that is true.  We have great scriptural evidences of that fact.  For example, when the Lord was calling Moses as recorded in the fourth chapter of Exodus, Moses felt inadequate to his calling and said starting in the 10<sup>th</sup> verse:</p>
<p align="LEFT">And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?</p>
<p align="LEFT"> Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Lord subsequently spoke to Moses about Aaron saying,</p>
<p align="LEFT">And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.<sup>11</sup> </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Lord qualified Moses by giving him Aaron to be a mouthpiece for him. </p>
<p align="LEFT">In another example of how the Lord qualifies His servants, the Lord qualified Saul.  The description of the anointing of Saul to be the captain over the Lord<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s inheritance starts in 1 Samuel 10:1:</p>
<p align="LEFT">Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his [Saul<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s]  head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not<u> because the LORD hath anointed thee</u> to be captain over his inheritance?<sup>12</sup> </p>
<p align="LEFT">Then starting midway through the 5<sup>th</sup> verse it says:</p>
<p align="LEFT">. . . thou shalt meet a company of prophets . . .; and they shall prophesy:</p>
<p align="LEFT">And <u>the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee</u>, and <u>thou</u> shalt prophesy with them, and <u>shalt be turned into another man</u>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for <u>God is with thee</u>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">. . . .</p>
<p align="LEFT">And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, <u>God gave him another heart</u>: and all those signs came to pass that day. </p>
<p align="LEFT">And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and <u>the Spirit of God came upon him</u>, and he prophesied among them (emphasis added).<sup>13</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p align="LEFT">Consider how the Lord prepared and assisted Saul so he would be qualified:</p>
<p align="LEFT">1. The Lord through Samuel anointed him<br />
2. The Spirit of the Lord came upon him<br />
3. He was turned into another man<br />
4. He was told that God was with him<br />
5. He was given another heart </p>
<p align="LEFT">We need to remember, however, that after being qualified, we should live thereafter in a way to continually remain entitled to that qualification.<sup>14</sup> </p>
<p align="LEFT">I sometimes think of the verse that says, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>. . . it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> (2 Nephi 25:23) and wonder if there are similarities with what we have been talking about.  For example, is it possible that the Lord qualifies us after we have done our best?  </p>
<p align="LEFT">For much of my professional life I was a lawyer for the Marriott Corporation, later Marriott International, Inc.  In that context, I became very impressed with the career of J. Willard Marriott.  After serving a mission for the Church in the Eastern States Mission,  on his way home, he passed through Washington D.C.  His biographer said:</p>
<p align="LEFT">. . . [H]e walked from Capital Hill to the Washington Monument, toiled up the steps to the top, walked back down again, and strolled over to the Lincoln Memorial.  Everywhere he went tourists and pedestrians sweltered and sweated in the sultry, humid air.  On the way back to his hotel, he just stood there in the street watching the crowds, he couldn<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t get over it: a push cart peddler would come along the street selling lemonade and soda pop and ice cream, and in minutes he would be cleaned out and on his way to stock up with another cartload.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;  </p>
<p align="LEFT"> Remembering how hot and humid Washington D.C. was, when Mr. Marriott graduated from the University of Utah, he used some money he had made selling woolen goods to loggers during summers when he wasn<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t attending Weber Junior College and the University of Utah and purchased an A &amp; W Root Beer Franchise for Washington D.C., Baltimore, and Richmond, Virginia.  He left for Washington D.C. in March 1927 with $3,000, $1,500 that he had saved from selling the woolen goods while he was going to school and $1,500 that he had borrowed  to make the preliminary arrangements for a root beer stand.  He returned to Utah in June for the graduation from the University of Utah of his fianc&eacute;<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>, Alice Sheets.  The next day, they were married in the Salt Lake Temple and the same day the two of them left in their old Ford car to drive across the country to Washington D.C.  The nine-seat root beer stand had opened in May, 1927.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">In 1976, when the company Mr. and Mrs. Marriott had formed dedicated two theme parks, each named <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Great America,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> one in Santa Clara, California and one near Chicago, Illinois,  each park had a small monument in a prominent place that bore this legend, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Great America is dedicated with pride to Mr. and Mrs. J. Willard Marriott, who began as so many have begun with only each other.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  That may be like many of you when you finish school.  You start with an education, a testimony, and a spouse and not much more.  When J. W. Marriott died in 1985, fifty-eight years after opening the nine-seat root beer stand, the Marriott Corporation had 154,600 employees and four billion two hundred and forty-one million seven hundred thousand dollars in annual sales.  He and Mrs. Marriott did the best they could with what they had.  He had been the President and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Marriott Corporation, the Chairman of two inaugurations of a president of the United States, and the president of the Washington D.C. Stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  She had been his partner throughout, a member of the Board of Directors of Marriott Corporation, and the National Treasurer of her political party.  They had been the parents of outstanding sons.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Returning to the scriptures, Peter, seeing a man lame from birth, said to him, </p>
<p align="LEFT">. . . Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p align="LEFT">The idea of a man who at one time couldn<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t walk at all now walking and leaping leaves a joyful picture in our minds.  </p>
<p align="LEFT">Neither Peter nor presumably the lame beggar had significant worldly goods, but they both did the best they could with what they had <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">B</font> something more important <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">B</font> and what they had was faith in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  This is explained in Acts 3:16 where, recounting this event, it says:</p>
<p align="LEFT">And his name [Christ<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s] <i>through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all</i> (Acts 3:16, emphasis added).   </p>
<p align="LEFT">In 1 Nephi 17:3 it says:</p>
<p align="LEFT">And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p align="LEFT">Nephi was told he should construct a ship. He didn<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t know how nor what to use.  He said to the Lord, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>. . . whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship . . .<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><sup>18
</sup>&nbsp;The Lord told him where to go to find ore.  He did so and made a bellows and tools <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>of the ore with which I did molten out of the rock.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><sup>19
</sup>&nbsp;His brothers told him he was a fool because, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>. . . he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><sup>20
</sup>&nbsp;Nephi related, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>. . . they did not believe that I could build a ship; neither would they believe that I was instructed of the Lord.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><sup>21</sup><font face="WP TypographicSymbols">
</font></p>
<p align="LEFT">His brothers said to him, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>We knew that ye could not construct a ship, for we knew that ye were lacking in judgment; wherefore, thou canst not accomplish so great a work.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><sup>22
</sup>&nbsp;Nephi subsequently responded to them,</p>
<p align="LEFT">. . . If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them.  If He should command me that I should say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I should say it, it would be done.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so many miracles among the children of men, how is it that He cannot instruct me that I should build a ship?<sup>23</sup></p>
<p align="LEFT">Nephi did the best he could with what he had.</p>
<p align="LEFT">How fortunate we are:</p>
<p align="LEFT">That Moses didn<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t let his slowness of speech keep him from doing the best he could.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That Saul accepted the calling and was turned into another man while God was with him.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That Peter didn<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t let his lack of worldly goods  keep him from acting with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That Nephi didn<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t say I won<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t undertake building a ship because I don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t have tools or materials or know how.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The question was previously posed, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>What do you know? What are your skills, your attributes, your assets?<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  If you find yourselves like Mr. and Mrs. Marriott with largely your education, your testimony, and your spouse, they did very well with what they had.  Many if not most of us here who are older found ourselves in the same position when we were your age.  Use your time wisely, take advice, store up the lessons learned along the way, enjoy the journey, don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t wait to do the perfect thing or hesitate to get in the <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>arena.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>  Know as Nephi knew and as I know that, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>. . . if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God He doth nourish them and strengthen them, and provide the means whereby they can accomplish the thing which He has commanded them; . . .<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font><sup>24
</sup>&nbsp;That doesn<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t mean that life will necessarily be easy or that we will be successful in everything we do but if we are not afraid to figuratively <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>run as fast as we can<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> and do the best we can do, we can take comfort in the fact that the Lord has said His work and His glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Finally, as one called to be an especial witness of Jesus Christ, I leave you my witness that He lives, that He is our Savior and Redeemer, that He taught us by His example how to be our best, and that salvation can be available to each of us if we will do the things necessary to earn and accept it.  In the name of Jesus Christ,

Global PerspectiveÂ”</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">Brigham Young UniversityÂ—Idaho
Forum</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">February 20, 2003</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">Dr. Jan Shipps</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly
known as the Mormon or LDS Church, was still very much an American institution
in 1960.Â  At that time a diaspora was getting underway that would lead to LDS
congregational units being established all across the nation and around the
world.Â  Within 40 years, the ensuing spatial diffusion would lead to this form
of MormonismÂ’s becoming a significant national and even worldwide religious
force. But the possibilities and implications of diaspora were by no means
obvious back then.Â  Consequently, most insiders and nearly all outsiders
regarded this formidable ecclesiastical body not simply as a uniquely American
institution.Â  They saw it as a Utah church.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By and large, they were correct.Â  The churchÂ’s membership
was concentrated in Utah and the surrounding areas of the intermountain region
of the western United States, an area where the Mormon presence was so
pervasive that anthropologists called it the Â“Mormon culture region.Â”Â 
Long-standing organizational units existed in Southern California and in a few
other areas in the Pacific coastal region, and the church was strong in Hawaii.Â 
It also had well-established congregational units in New York, Washington,
D.C., and several other metropolitan areas in the U.S.Â  Besides that, nearly 10
percent of the churchÂ’s members resided outside the United States with most of
that number living in such English-speaking countries as Canada, England, Australia
and New Zealand, or they lived in Mexico and Northern Europe.Â  For the most
part, however, Mormons were American and they lived in the West.Â  If they lived
anywhere else, they tended to think of the Great Basin, and most especially Utah,
as their homeland.Â  Thus, it comes as no surprise that many non-Mormons thought
this religion was a Western phenomenon--somewhat akin, in the secular realm, to
cowboys and Indians.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mormons, of course, did not share this popular perception.Â 
The members of the church whose headquarters were in Salt Lake City were
generally aware that another form of Mormonism was headquartered in Independence,
 Missouri.Â  Although it was a much smaller ecclesiastical body, the mountain
Saints realized--at least vaguely--that there were prairie Saints as well.Â 
Moreover, in early years of Sunday School lessons, both sorts of Saints learned
that their churches evolved out of a movement of Christian Restoration that
started in western New York State in the late 1820s.Â  So Saints of every stripe
were conscious of the fact that Mormonism did not begin in the West.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Besides thinking that the movement was distinctively
Western, many Gentiles (for that was what non-Mormons were called in those
days) werenÂ’t sure whether, and if so, exactly how Mormonism fit into
Christianity.Â  Actually, it is likely that most of the Mormons knew very little
about the structure of the Christian tradition.Â  But their experience told them
they were as surely Christian as they were Mormon.Â  It also told them that
their church was distinctly different from other Christian churches.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It always has been different, even though its first
adherents had much in common with the members of many other indigenous Christian
movements that came into being in the United States during the early national
period.Â  Yet by the time Mormonism took institutional shape as the Church of
Christ in Fayette, New York in 1830, this particular group advanced three
distinctive beliefs that separated Mormonism not only from all other versions
of primitive and millennial Christianity then present in New England and the
Middle Atlantic region of the nation, but also from all other existing forms of
Protestantism, Catholicism, and Orthodoxy on the earth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first in this trio of beliefs (that quickly emerged as
fundamental tenets of doctrine) was that a living prophet led their church.Â 
The other two truly distinctive beliefs were that they had the priesthoods of
Aaron and Melchizedek which were legitimate because they had been restored to
them by none other than John the Baptist.Â  In addition, besides the Old and New
Testaments, they had a complementary work of scripture.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">[As everyone in this audience knows] the members of the
first Mormon group followed a 24 year-old visionary farm lad, Joseph Smith,
Jr., whose words and actions persuaded them that he was a modern Â“seer,
translator, and prophet.Â” They believed that the restoration of the ancient
priesthoods came through SmithÂ’s prophetic agency and that, through the same
agency, the Church of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth after being absent
ever since a Â“Great ApostasyÂ” occurred at the end of the Apostolic era.Â  Of
even greater significance, SmithÂ’s followers accepted the claim that, with
divine assistance manifested in the form of seer stones known as the Â“Urim and
Thummim,Â” Smith had translated the Book of Mormon from etchings engraved on a
set of golden plates that he found buried in a hill not far from his home in
Manchester, New York.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To believers, this was modern scripture, a marvelous work
and a wonder that signified the nearness of the end of time.Â  Unbelievers,
however, facetiously and dismissively described this work as SmithÂ’s Â“golden
bible.Â”Â  They also called SmithÂ’s followers Â“Mormonites.Â”Â  The members of the
new church rejected that nickname, taking instead the name early Christians had
used in addressing each other.Â  They called themselves Saints, but recognizing
the passage of time since the apostolic age, they described themselves as <i>Latter-day</i>
Saints.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Indeed, notwithstanding their possession of a new work of
scripture, these Restorationalists shared a great deal with other Christian
bodies.Â  In fact, a substantial portion of the Mormon pattern of belief came
from the BibleÂ—the Old Testament as well as the New Testament.Â  But the Saints
concern for going into the world to preach the gospel to every creature seems
not to have come from the Â“Great CommissionÂ” the disciples received at the end
of the Gospel of Matthew.Â  Although the text of the Book of Mormon included a
similar Â“go ye into all the world and preach the gospelÂ” charge (Mormon 9: 22),
the SaintsÂ’ fervent and powerful missionary impulse came not from that charge
so much as from the title page of the new scripture.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Overstating the critical importance to Mormonism of this New
Testament of Jesus Christ, as it is now sub-titled, would be difficult.Â  But as
this is a movement that has undergone dramatic development across its nearly
175-year history, the place and function of the Book of Mormon within the
movement has varied considerably.Â  The bookÂ’s very existence has always set
SmithÂ’s followers apart from all other Christian groups, but its internal
function has been far more complex. While reading it often convinced people of
the truth of Mormonism, its content seems not to have been much used as the
basis for sermon texts in the early years.Â  But in those same years, the bookÂ’s
miraculous coming forth was always read as a sign that the end was near.Â 
Therefore, those who accepted its historical claim that certain Hebrew peoples
living in the western hemisphere between the end of the fifth century B.C.E.
and 600 C.E.Â  heard the Christian message from Jesus himself believed that they
were living in the Â“winding-up scene.Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With regard to the story of Mormonism in global perspective,
the Book of Mormon was singularly important because, as indicated, the agenda
for Mormon missions was set by the declaration on its title page about the dual
purpose for the bookÂ’s coming forth.Â  That unambiguous message was that the
book was written for Native Americans (here called Â“LamanitesÂ”) to tell them
they were a remnant of the House of Israel.Â  It was also written Â“to the
convincing of the Jew and Gentile that <span style="text-transform:uppercase">jesus
is the christ, </span>the<span style="text-transform:uppercase"> eternal god,</span>
manifesting himself to all nations.Â”Â  Accepting responsibility for delivering
that information to these particular target audiences, the new church faced a
dual task:Â  carrying the message to the Indians and going into all nations in
the world to convince both Jews and Gentiles that Jesus is the Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since they believed that time was short, soon after the
church was organized in April 1830, revelation underscored the immediacy of the
need to carry this message to the Indian nations and to people everywhere.Â  In
September 1830, the Mormon prophet received a revelation that four members of
his fledgling flock should undertake a mission to the Indians.Â  They were
charged with preaching the gospel and establishing the church among those who
received it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Few, if any, Native Americans were thoroughly converted to
Mormonism as a result of this first Lamanite mission.Â  But this undertaking was
terribly important because it resulted in the establishing of a Â“stake in the
tent of ZionÂ” in Independence, Missouri, a settlement that stood on the border
of Â“Indian countryÂ” where Native Americans at that time were being forced to go
in response to the nationÂ’s Indian Removal Policy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This initial Indian mission was exceedingly significant to
the history of the Latter-day Saints for another reason.Â  As they wended their
way west, the missionaries not only preached to the Indians, but also to anyone
else who would listen.Â  In Ohio, the missionaries converted an unconventional
Campbellite minister and his entire congregation to the new faith, and not long
after the prophet heard of this mass conversion of a whole congregation, he
announced that he had received a revelation that he, too, should go to Ohio and
that the New York Saints should go with him.Â  This led to the organization of a
second stake in ZionÂ’s tent.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This was the not the first revelatory mention of the concept
of the assembling of the LordÂ’s elect in one placeÂ—that came back in the summer
of 1828, almost two years before the church was organizedÂ—but it was the first
time the Saints made this critically important gathering concept operative.Â 
From that point in time forward, the command that converts to Mormonism should
leave their homes and go to live in close proximity with other Saints took precedence
over the revelation that said missionaries should preach the gospel and
establish the church among those who received it.Â  This Â“gatheringÂ” principle
would further separate Mormonism from most other forms of Christianity.Â  In
addition, it would have a profound effect on how long it took for Mormonism to
become a global movement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Exactly why this was the case takes some explaining.Â  More
Saints gathered to Missouri than to Ohio, probably because the prophet
identified that stateÂ’s Jackson County as the center of Zion, the location of
the New Jerusalem where Christ would return to launch the new millennial age.Â 
Unfortunately, the resulting rapid influx of Mormon settlers into the frontier
town ofÂ  Independence appears to have frightened the old settlers so much that,
in 1834, they drove the Saints away.Â  For a time the LDS refugees settled in
nearby Clay County, but when the state set aside a place for them in the
northwestern Missouri, that became the place for a new gathering.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For much of the 1830s the Saints in Ohio were more fortunate
than the church members in Missouri.Â  The town of Kirtland was both the
administrative headquarters of the church and its principal base for missionary
activities.Â  In 1838, however, for a variety of reasons, secular as well as
sacred, the hostile actions of northeastern Ohio mobs of old settlers caused
Joseph Smith and other church leaders as well as most of the churchÂ’s members
to flee to the new Missouri gathering place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before that terrible Â“drivingÂ” as the Saints call it, two
events of immense importance to the story of global Mormonism occurred.Â  The
first was the construction of the Kirtland Temple and its dedication in 1836, a
Pentecost-like occasion in which the temple built by the Saints received divine
warrant as the place of the restoration of ancient ordinances that were once
performed in the temple at Jerusalem.Â  The Saints came to believe that these
ancient ordinances, which had been absent from the earth even longer than the
church organization, were integrally related to their possession of the ancient
priesthoods of Aaron and Melchizedek, therefore equal in importance to the
Restoration as any of their other distinctive doctrines.Â  This temple was the
first in a series of LDS temples that would become the sacramental centers of
the church.Â  They would become places of pilgrimage, beacons signaling a
Saintly presence in particular geographical areas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The other occurrence critical to the globalization of
Mormonism was the revelation on priesthood which included the organization of
the Council of the Twelve, a body that would serve as a Â“Traveling High
CouncilÂ” that could preside over the church in regions where Saints were not
gathered into organized administrative units (stakes).Â  Aside from the Lamanite
Mission described above, most of the missionaries who were sent out from
Kirtland were assigned to go to areas within the United States or eastern
Canada.Â  But in 1837, soon after the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, a key
member of the Council of the Twelve was called to initiate missionary work
outside North America.Â  Despite the horrific suffering the Saints had to face
in the next decade--arrest of the prophet and several other church leaders,
dissension and apostasy among the Twelve, and a Mormon War in Missouri, the
flight of the entire body of Saints back across the Mississippi River to
Illinois, the building of a kingdom on the Mississippi at Nauvoo, and the
prophetÂ’s murder--successful missionary work went forward in Great Britain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before the English mission had been in operation for two
years, 1500 converts were baptized.Â  Then, between 1839 and 1841, as the Saints
were struggling to overcome the trauma of the Missouri Mormon War and
beleaguered as they settled into a new gathering place in Nauvoo, nine
different members of the Council of the Twelve served missions in Great
Britain.Â  Their efforts paid off handsomely in numbers of converts, with 4,000
more being baptized during those two years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rather than establishing the church among those who accepted
the gospel in Britain, however, the missionaries preached the gathering
doctrine as a central element of the millennialist Restoration message.Â  As a
result, one dimension of the missionary task was arranging ocean passage so
that converts could gather with the Saints in their American Zion.Â  And gather
they did.Â  By 1841, more than a fourth of the total membership of the church
was made up of English converts, many of whom sacrificed virtually everything
to travel to the land of Zion where they could join their co-religionists in
preparing for the Second Coming.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Instead of experiencing millennial bliss, the new converts
were tested and tried as they labored to find places to live and means to
sustain themselves in Nauvoo and the surrounding areas on both sides of the
Mississippi River.Â  The murder of the Mormon prophet was an additional
stumbling block.Â  But the tribulations of the ocean crossing and the
difficulties the new Saints faced in the U.S. had little effect on the convert
stream.Â  In point of fact, the momentum of convert arrivals increased as the
gathering continued after members of the LDS community were forced to abandon
the city-state they had fashioned in Illinois.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many people, including a fair number of scholars, reckon
that a huge majority of LDS church members followed Brigham Young to the valley
of the Great Salt Lake where they again created a kingdom, this one more fully
realized and fleshed out.Â  This estimate may be mistaken.Â  While the Twelve
took charge and kept the community together for almost three years before the
Saints were compelled to flee, what actually happened after the prophetÂ’s
murder is that the movement split apart.Â  Atomized.Â  Henceforward there would
be many Mormonisms, not just one.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A few Saints remained in Nauvoo, and a substantial number of
Mormons stayed in Illinois and Iowa where, in 1860, they Â“reorganizedÂ” the
church under the leadership of the prophetÂ’s eldest son, Joseph Smith III.Â 
Earlier other church members established what amounted to Mormon denominational
units in Wisconsin, northern Michigan, Texas, Pennsylvania, and even New York.Â 
But only the Strangite group in Michigan called for a gathering of Saints, and
that movement did not last long.Â  None of the others, even the strongest one that
became known as the Â“Reorganization,Â” treated the gathering principle as
critical to what being Mormon meant.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But this was not the case with the Council of the Twelve and
Brigham Young (who became the president and prophet of the church that would
become the institutional expression of Mormonism in the Great Basin).Â  Keeping
in mind that it was a revealed principle, and perhaps recalling the appeal that
gathering to Zion had for British converts, they made coming to live in the
kingdom one of the first principles of the Mormon gospel. As a direct
consequence of adding the gathering of Saints from Great Britain and other
parts of northern Europe (especially Scandinavia and Germany) to the numbers
who made the pioneer trek from Nauvoo, the LDS settlement in the inter-mountain
West rapidly became the form of Mormonism that had more adherents than any
other.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the long term, the gathering was probably less important
than the quartet of distinctive beliefs that first set Mormonism apart from
other forms of Christianity.Â  But along with the SaintsÂ’ understanding that
they were led by a living prophet and that they possessed the Book of Mormon,
the legitimate priesthoods of Aaron and Melchizedek, and had access to the
ancient temple ordinances that endowed them from on high and gave them entrÃ©e
to exaltation in the celestial kingdom, the gathering that occurred in the
Great Basin made possible a period of fullness if not of time, then of living
in the State of Deseret, a literal Â“Kingdom of God in the tops of the mountains.Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A theocracy at first, Deseret became Utah territory before a
decade had passed.Â  Since the principal ecclesiastical officers no longer
occupied the civil seats of power, the territory became a political realm with
an established church rather than a theocracy.Â  As it turned out, however, this
was a fine point that did not much matter as far as the experience of living in
Zion was concerned.Â  The Saints controlled the political and economic arenas as
well as the social system that, for nearly half a century included the public
practice of plural marriage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But then two things happened to change what many Saints
remember as a difficult yet halcyon pioneer period.Â  One was external and the
other internal.Â  Backed by legal fiat and political reality, the federal
government moved from outside the culture to insist that if Utah wanted to take
its place as a sovereign state alongside the other sovereign states in the
nation, the territory would have to prove that it could pattern itself after
other U.S. political, economic, and social systems.Â  This effort initiated
dramatic change in the areas of government, business, and industry, and it
brought about the cessation of the practice of plural marriage, thereby making
the boundary between Zion and Babylon porous.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The change within the community came some 15 or 20 years
later after Utah had gained statehood and after the managing of the former
kingdomÂ’s economy was turned over to individuals and corporations, creating a
system almost (but not quite) as capitalist as that in other parts of the
nation.Â  In taking stock of the new situation, church leaders realized that as
long as agriculture and mining were the principal means of earning livelihoods,
the mountainous and desert region that had served them so well during the
pioneer period could not support an infinite number of gathered Saints.Â  As a
result, the church changed its position about the necessity of continuing the
gathering.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This change was gradual and came first in the form of
de-emphasizing the gathering.Â  In 1910, for example, the Church President
Joseph F. Smith told European converts that Â“at presentÂ” they did not need to
trouble themselves too much about emigration.Â  The Â“at presentÂ” time frame was
extended indefinitely in 1921 when the churchÂ’s First Presidency, on the basis
of economic rather than religious reasons, issued an official statement urging
missionaries to stop preaching immigration.Â  Just prior to World War II, Saints
in foreign lands were urged to gather out of Â“spiritual Babylon, out of the
midst of wickedness,Â” but they did not need to go so far as to gather to Utah.Â 
And soon after the war, the reinterpretation of the gathering revelation was
complete when President Spencer W. Kimball told the Saints to Â“[R]emain [in
their own lands] and build up a people to the Lord.Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This 20<sup>th</sup> century reinterpretation of the
gathering revelation can be stated in another way: <i>Zion is where the people
of God are.</i>Â Â  Stated in this manner the theological ground shifts,
returning Mormonism to its earliest revelation in which Saints were sent on
missions.Â  Section 28:8 of the Doctrine and Covenants reports that in September
1830 the Lord instructed the Saints to Â“Go [unto the unconverted] and preach my
gospel unto them; and inasmuch as they receive thy teachings thou shalt cause
my church to be established among them.Â”Â  As long as the missionaries preached
the gathering along with the gospel, this was not the way Mormonism worked.Â 
For almost an entire century the churchÂ’s global perspective was centripetal,
so directed toward the center that in the gathering process converts were
Christianized, Â“MormonizedÂ” and Americanized all at the same time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After the reinterpretation of the various gathering
revelations, things started to shift so that gradually the churchÂ’s global
perspective became centrifugal.Â  The center remains strong, but the church is
clearly moving outward through a process in which missionaries, church leaders,
and indigenous Saints are working together to create multiple centers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But note carefully, this is not a move that simply leads to
a new definition of Zion as being the place where the people of God are.Â  What
is different is that church organization into branches, wards, and stakes
follows as soon as a sufficient number of indigenous Saints are ordained to the
Melchizedek priesthood to make up a competent leadership cadre.Â  Of greater
significance, wherever enough Saints are gathered together in close proximity,
a LDS temple is being constructed.Â  Once that happens, Zion is truly there
allowing the Saints in the nations of the world to create area and regional
gatherings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But that gets us ahead of the story.Â  While perceptions are
amazingly persistent across time, in the past four decades, church growth and
geographical expansion have brought so many changes to Mormonism that the
notion that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint is a Utah church, or
even that is an American church, is being seriously challenged. For that
reason, the time has come to dispense with the old idea that if one understands
the Mormon situation in Utah and the intermountain West, one understands
Mormonism.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, in order to see what actually seems to be
going on and to comprehend the problems the LDS Church is facing now that there
are more church members outside than inside the United States, it is helpful to
recall that Saints Â“do churchÂ” in a particular way.Â  This ecclesiastical
institution has always been hierarchal in nature and it has a highly structured
system of lay priesthood headed by a president who, by virtue of his position,
is also the Mormon prophet.Â  Two counselors who, with him, make up the Â“First
PresidencyÂ” assist the prophet/president.Â  Along with them, a body of Â“General
AuthoritiesÂ” that presides over the whole church is made up of the Council of
the Twelve and additional priesthood leaders who are called into full-time
service as presidents or members of the Quorums of Seventy or as members of the
Presiding Bishopric.Â  Because it is headquartered in Salt Lake City, in Â“the
tops of the mountainsÂ” as early Mormon leaders put it, thinking of the LDS
Church as one that is ruled from the top down has always been easy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Surely this was the way the Mormon system worked in the
nineteenth and well into the last decades of the twentieth century.Â  To some
extent, it still works this way, but because of the diaspora, the church often
works from the center out rather than the top down.Â  In time, this might cause
some dilution of the top down concept.Â  But not yet.Â  The General Authorities
still make the important decisions including decisions about materials and
programs.Â  Members of the robust church bureaucracy that has come into
existence in the past half-century produce the materials, see to their
distribution, and assist as needed as the members of the priesthood hierarchy
see the churchÂ’s doctrines, policies, and programs are carried out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To guarantee that the programs and materials are consistent
with church doctrine and practice and to prevent duplication and keep things
running smoothly, the church initiated Â“Correlation,Â” a process of oversight
that up to now has been crucial to the creation of a successful worldwide
church.Â  While this oversight is sometimes experienced as overbearing and
repressive, it serves the clear purpose of locating and clarifying where
authority rests in the LDS system.Â  This is critical because the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been obviously undergoing dramatic change
as church growth and geographical expansion became normal conditions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps it makes some difference whether change is the
result of positive or negative conditions.Â  No matter what the cause, however,
change always causes the ground to shift in unexpected ways.Â  This happened
when the prophet Joseph Smith was murdered.Â  In the absence of a clear stream
of authority, the church faced dissension, division, and breaking apart, the
product of which was a multiplicity of Mormonisms.Â  The dramatic changes the
church is currently experiencing as Mormonism goes global could pose a similar
loss of clarity about where authority rests, not at the very top of the
hierarchy, but at penultimate levels where indigenous leadership and cultural
variation often make adapting one-size-fits-all policies and programs
exceedingly difficult.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So far, correlation has been a central factor in preventing
a repetition of the creation of multiple Mormonisms.Â  Whether it will continue
to be effective seems to me to be an open question.Â  The reason I say Â“it seems
to meÂ” is that the current rate of change in Mormonism may be too rapid to
permit leaders in Salt Lake City to anticipate the complexity and
complicatedness that are imbedded in Â“Mormonizing en mass.Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In noting the hardship and distress that converts had to
face as they traveled to Zion, Brigham Young said that the trek, <i>i.e.</i>,
the very process of gathering, was for Â“making Saints.Â” Now that congregations
made up primarily of converts do church in virtually all the nations of the
world, will carry out correlated policies and programs turn enough of the
baptized initiates into Saints to make the wards and stakes in Nigeria, the
Philippines, Venezuela, Korea, Iceland, and thousand other places truly
Mormon.Â  Again it seems to me too soon to know for sure.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What we do know is that by the turn of the twenty-first
century, it was obvious that the face of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints has been radically altered.Â  Within the U.S. it has a
nationwide geographical reach, and it had increased so much in numbers of
members that it ranked as one of the six largest ecclesiastical bodies in the
nation.Â  While such internal developments were impressive, more church members
resided outside than inside the United States.Â  In the year 2000, these Saints
outside the U.S. were gathered into nearly 12,000 wards and branches of small
and medium size, with indigenous leadership presiding over the overwhelming
majority of these congregations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At every annual conference, the church generates a new
statistical picture revealing the increasing globalization of Mormonism.Â  But
for todayÂ’s Latter-day Saints that evidence is not needed because the reality
of the worldwide reach of Mormonism is everywhere apparent from the pages of
the church publications to the student bodies of BYU campuses, and in the hearts
and minds not only of church leaders but in the sensibility and consciousness
of Latter-day Saints of every age and every station.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What this will mean for the future of the church remains to
be seen.Â  There are many problems.Â  Retention of members is an ever-present
challenge that is probably more serious in stakes and wards away from the
traditional Mormon culture region than in the intermountain West.Â  Training
enough lay leaders (both male and female) to carry out the church program is
also difficult.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But several things augur success:Â  the priesthood revelation
of 1978 universalized the message.Â  Correlation is still working to prevent the
formation of many Mormonism rather than one.Â  The translation of the Book of
Mormon into a great multiplicity of languages and the construction of temples
throughout the world are working together to create a global Mormon identity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Salt Lake City is likely to remain the center place at least
until the Saints return to Jackson County to await the Second Coming.Â  But the
likelihood that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will ever again
be simply described as an American institution or a Utah church is slowly
fading into history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">Last November, I received a telephone call from a man who identified himself as Garth Hall,
calling on behalf of BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Â–</font>Idaho.  He asked if I was Elder Ray H. Wood of the Seventy.  When I
responded that I was, but had been released a year ago, the line went dead.  Thinking that he had
made a mistake and was really trying to reach Elder Robert S. Wood an active member of the
Seventy, I assumed he had simply hung up rather than embarrass me by telling me he had
reached the wrong Elder Wood.  Thirty seconds later, the phone rang again.  Brother Hall
confirmed that he had reached the right Elder Wood and asked me to be the speaker at this
devotional today.  I am much honored and grateful to be with you.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I was invited to speak at a young single adult conference in Johannesburg, South
Africa, where I was serving as Area President.  Six hundred attended the conference, more than
half of whom were black.  As a matter of interest, I asked all of those who were first generation
converts to stand.  Almost all of the black members stood up.  Anticipating such a response, I
had prepared my remarks on the subject of establishing strong generational foundations.  This is
the same subject about which I shall speak today, even though I am certain most of you are many
generations removed from ancestors who joined the Church.</p>
<p>Why is that subject so important?  Because each generation makes its own contributions to those
that follow.  Be they worthy and constructive or debasing and profligate, their effects will
unequivocally be felt and recorded in the habits, traditions and lives of their successors.  <em>At least</em>
one owes the responsibility of preserving what they have received, neither detracting nor
diminishing from their own generational inheritance.  But there is an eternal law to which all
generations of families are subject, that <span style="text-decoration: underline">demands</span> improvement, enhancement, increase,
betterment and enlargement of the heritage entrusted to each person by those whose lives were
spent in worthy effort and sacrifice to provide us with what we receive.  That law is stated in
Doctrine &amp; Covenants 82:3: " For of him unto whom much is given, much is <span style="text-decoration: underline">required,</span>" not
simply expected as is frequently quoted.  On the other hand, significant consequences devolve
upon the souls of those who neglect this law or who by their actions - deliberate or by default -
deprive, mislead or squander the accumulated heritage of prior generations.  There is indeed a
sacred trust bequeathed to each of us to nourish and honor the contributions of those who precede
us and to pass them on to our successors unsullied and in tact and increased by our own worthy
contributions.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>In the case of those precious blacks from Africa, they are truly pioneers in the most literal sense
of the word.  They are trailblazers and initiators who are preparing the way and laying the gospel
foundation for others who have few family member exemplars to follow.  They of all must get it
right.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I chose as my text for them Isaiah 58:12 which so aptly describes those who have chosen to join
the restored Church and who must now repair and change old traditions, beliefs and habits that
have encumbered ancestors so that new generations may go forward.  "And they that shall be of
thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and
thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in."<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Imagine if you can their daunting task.  They have only had the priesthood for 25 years.  What
stirrings must have filled their breasts as they heard the words: "The long-promised day has come
when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood, with power to
exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that flows therefrom,
including the blessings of the temple." ( Doctrine &amp; Covenants, Official Declaration - 2.)  Those
are blessings we have always had and take for granted, frequently without full appreciation.  But
"whether as the first in your family or as the fifth generation to hold the priesthood," spoke Elder
Keith K. Hilbig in a recent General Conference, "we have each come to earth with a personal
heritage of faithfulness and foreordination.  Such knowledge gives us a firm resolve to always
honor the priesthood and thereby to create or continue a multigenerational family in the Church
and in the celestial kingdom." ( Ensign, November, 2001, p.45.)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Imagine the desperate desire and will of those people to establish rock-hard footings of
knowledge and learning, to build sure foundations of faithful activity, and then to raise families
blessed by ordinances and covenants, tying them to each other, with their dead  for whom they
have only had the last 25 years to prepare.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>The blacks of Africa are of course only part of the first generation members of the Church from
all over the world.  None of these have ancestors that are able to pass on a firm foundation of
beliefs of the restored gospel, but each one can nevertheless claim the spiritual ancestry of all the
progenitors of our faith by adopting their teachings, living their examples and striving to walk in
their footsteps.  Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf said it well: "I have no ancestors among the 19<sup>th</sup> century
pioneers.  However, since the first days of my Church membership, I have felt a close kinship to
those early pioneers who crossed the plains.  They are my spiritual ancestry, as they are for each
and every member of the Church, regardless of nationality, language or culture.  They have
established not only a safe place in the west, but also a spiritual foundation for the building of the
kingdom of God in all the nations of the world." ( Ensign, Nov. 2002, p. 10.)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>How then can one respond to that sacred trust of raising up "the foundations of many
generations?"  I believe there are definable provisions that one can follow to accomplish this.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p><b>PRESERVE OUR HERITAGE OF FAITH</b><br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>The first is perhaps axiomatic, self-evident to any member of the Church: Stay faithful to the
restored gospel, believe and follow the directions and counsel of the living prophets.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I know a man with whom I have been friends for most of my life.  He is an accomplished
professional, with degrees from prestigious universities.  He travels frequently to various
countries and places, unselfishly sharing his great knowledge and skills with others.  In every
sense of the word he is an honorable man of the world. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>He was born into an active LDS home and grew up in the nurture of the gospel.  He served a
mission and was married in the temple.  Several generations of faithful Church members have
left a firm and devoted heritage to him.  Coming from a foreign land, they had crossed the plains
as early pioneers to the Salt Lake Valley, and had repeatedly responded to calls to serve in many
places and for various purposes.  This pattern has been followed by generations preceding him
for many years.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Somehow in his later years, things began to change.  He ceased his activity in the Church,
repudiated its teachings and eventually had his name removed from the records.  His family,
following his example, had nothing to do with the Church.  Whether is was his divorce from his
first wife, his noted success as a professional, his accumulation of the things of the world, or his
affiliation with those of his own academic prowess, self-styled intellectuals who have little use
for faith in the humble teachings of Jesus Christ, I know not.  But this much I do know. 
Whatever he has, lays claim to, desires or considers important, has been acquired at a terrible
price.  He has exchanged his heritage for a mess of pottage.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>We still exchange Christmas cards and his usually include a picture of his entire family - three
generations - apparently happy and devoted to each other.  But not one is a member of the
Church.  No priesthood leads or blesses them.  No temple ordinances promise a continuation of
their happy family association.  The lessons, experiences and counsel of prior generations have
been discarded and refuted.  A new generational foundation has been adopted, but one that leads
not to "A fullness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever," but rather to a lesser position
where they "are appointed angels in Heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister
for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory." (
Doctrine &amp; Covenants 132:19 and 16.)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Each individual member of each generation has enormous responsibilities to those who follow. 
If God holds us accountable to Him for our words, works and thoughts, (Alma 12:14), is it not
likely we are also accountable for the effects of those same things on our own families and
associates?<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Have you ever watched the ripples caused by throwing something into a smooth pool of water? 
They spread out in every direction, moving far beyond the point of impact with an effect that is
hard to counter or contain.  So it is with almost everything we do in our family associations. 
"Our eyes are perpetual cameras imprinting upon sensitive mental plates and storing in the brain
for future use, everything which comes within their range.  There is a recording device in our
natures which catches, however thoughtless and transient, every word we utter, and renders it
immortal.  These notes may appear a hundred years hence, reproduced in our descendants, in all
their beautiful or terrible detail."<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p><b>TREASURE OUR OWN PERSONAL HERITAGE</b><br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Next, learn about your own generational heritage, treasure it and live responsibly to preserve it,
add to it and pass it on with "no clouds upon our titles."<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball counseled us, "Journals are a way of counting our blessings and of
leaving an inventory of these blessings for our posterity....A journal is the literature of
superiority.  What could you do better for your children and your children's children than to
record the story of your life, your triumphs over adversity, your recovery after a fall, your
progress when all seemed black, your rejoicing when you had finally achieved?<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>"Write in it your goings and comings, your deepest thoughts, your achievements and your
failures, your associations and your triumphs, your impressions and your testimonies. 
Remember, the Savior chastised those who failed to record important events.  (See 3 Nephi 23:6-13)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>"I promise you that if your will keep your journals and records, they will indeed be a source of
great inspiration to you, each other, your children, your grandchildren, and others throughout the
generations." ( The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, pp.349-351.)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Very few of my ancestors left any written records of their lives, but two did, my maternal and
fraternal great grandfathers.  Both were converts to the Church.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>In 1861, a new plant was completed for the production of paper made from old rags.  Brigham
Young called my great grandfather, George Goddard, on a three year rag mission for the purpose
of gathering whatever could be converted into printing paper.  He recorded in his journal, "This
calling was a severe blow to my native pride.... after being known in the community for years as
a merchant and auctioneer, and then to be seen on the streets going from door to door with a
basket on one arm and an empty sack on the other, enquiring for rags at every house.  Oh, what a
change in the aspect of affairs....When President Young first made the proposition, the
humiliating prospect almost stunned me, but a few moments' reflection reminded me that I came
to these valleys of the mountains from my native country, England, for the purpose of doing the
will of my Heavenly Father, my time and means must be at His disposal.  I therefore answered
President Young in the affirmative, and for over three years, from Franklin, Idaho, in the north,
and Sanpete in the south, my labors extended, not only visiting hundreds of houses during the
week days, but preaching rag sermons on Sunday. The first time I ever spoke in the
Tabernacle....was a rag discourse, and President Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball backed it
up with their testimony and enlarged upon it.."<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>"At the end of ten months, Goddard had collected 20,000 pounds of rags, and by the end of his
three-year mission, he had collected more than 100,000 pounds of rags for the paper." ( Great
Basin Kingdom, p. 115-116.)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>At the conclusion of his rag mission, Brother Goddard recorded, "Many years have passed away
since that rag mission was performed.  I have never regretted it, and instead of its having been
humiliatory in its influence among the community, it only increased their respect and confidence
toward me....I therefore beg of all my young friends to hold themselves in readiness for any kind
of mission they may be called upon to fill, and never say no....No matter what kind of labor any
man holding the priesthood may be called to perform by the servants of the Lord, let it be done
by a cheerful response, and God will sincerely bless you.  Cultivate a humble and self-denying
spirit, and I will promise you the yoke of Christ shall sit easy and his burden light upon you." 
(The Deseret Weekly, April 4, 1896, p. 485.)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>When William Wood attended general conference on October 7, 1867 and heard his name read
along with 99 other young brethren as missionaries to settle the Big Muddy Valley, he was
astounded.  He had some brief periods of remorse as he contemplated the labor which had gone
into his business and the brand new home just occupied six weeks earlier.  William regarded a
call from the First Presidency the equivalent of a call from God.  Once the call was officially
confirmed and he was appropriately set apart, he hastened his preparations for the journey.  He
sold his butcher shop, his slaughter house, his fine brick home which had cost him $4,000, and
within four weeks he was ready to proceed south into the unknown.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>On their way through Utah valley, they encountered Brigham Young returning to Salt Lake. 
Brigham spoke, "What is your name and were are you going?"  William Wood of Salt Lake City
going to the Muddy," replied William.  "You go and fill the mission and God will bless you." 
Brigham sat down and the line of carriages proceeded on.  The occupants of each carriage smiled
compromisingly at William's family as they passed, each one thankful in their hearts that their
calling was not to the Muddy.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>For four years William Wood and his family endured unbelievable hardship and privations.  Hard
work and faith had sustained them through the years.  The spiritual and emotional strength gained
through this service to the Lord became dominating factors in their character that helped them
meet all adversities.  This is best represented by Elizabeth's classic statement made while
residing in a humble dug-out within sight of their former new home soon after they returned to
Salt Lake City.  As William wrote it, "While reflecting over the five year's experience, I asked
my wife how she would like such a house as our old home now?  Her noble answer was, 'I am
glad you have filled your mission, and I would rather be in this dugout with your mission filled,
than in that fine house with your mission unfilled'...." ( William Wood Pioneer 1862, published
by Daughters of Utah Pioneers, p. 293.)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>A short time before his death in 1916, William Wood bore this testimony.  "I have lived to see
several sons preach the gospel to the nations; also some of my grandsons.  This is in fulfillment
of my patriarchal blessing.  Thus I lift up my voice in praise and thanksgiving to God for the
testimony He has given me concerning the truth and divinity of this great latter-day work, that
Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, and that this work is true, and my greatest desire is that all my
children may live so that the Holy Spirit will dwell in their hearts, to give them a testimony that
they may know for themselves that the work is true.  My only object in writing the above is to
impress all my family to maintain a strong determination, under all circumstances that fate may
call them to meet in this life, to hold fast to the gospel of Jesus Christ, the faith of their parents." 
(Ibid. p.300.)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Now I ask you my Brother and Sisters, what person knowing of such noble and faithful ancestors
could do anything but treasure, follow and build upon such a choice heritage?<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p><b>FULFILL OUR OBLIGATION TO PRECEDING GENERATIONS</b><br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>A third provision is to recognize your obligation to those who have passed on, to do for them
what they cannot do for themselves.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>A few months ago, Sister Wood and I stood among the 10,000 white crosses in Collville-Saint-Larent, France, marking the graves of those who died in the great Normandy invasion of World
War II.  As we looked upon those markers extending in every direction almost as far as one could
see, we knew we stood on holy, sacred ground.  Each cross bore the name of one who made the
ultimate sacrifice to keep for us what we have today.  Many crosses marking those who could not
be identified stated simply, "Known but to God."  They all lost their lives in that terrible war, and
they want - no they demand - that their sacrifices have meaning.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Along with those whose lives were given to preserve our nation and freedoms, we owe even
more to our generational ancestors who have given us the gospel, covenants and temple blessings
or who have at least given us life and a heritage of worthy traditions.  Many of those may even
now be waiting expectantly for us to complete our family histories and to go into the temples to
join them with us, "that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of
dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place."  (Doctrine &amp; Covenants
128:18.)  Elder Robert D. Hales reminds us in our recent general conference that if we do this,      
 "The generations of your ancestors before you and your posterity after you will rise up and call
you blessed."  (Ensign,  Nov. 2002, p.29.)</p>
<p>A statement attributed to the Prophet Joseph Smith describes the feelings of those for whom we
do this sacred work.  "Horace Cummings recorded: 'Concerning the work for the dead, (Joseph)
said that in the resurrection those who had been worked for, would fall at the feet of those who
had done their work, kiss their feet, embrace their knees and manifest the most exquisite
gratitude.'  The Prophet added, 'We do not comprehend what a blessing to them these ordinances
are'." ( Joseph Smith The Prophet, Truman G. Madsen, p.99.)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>This work for our deceased ancestors is more than just "something nice to do," and even more
than a privilege.  It is a solemn duty.  "We are not only to be messengers of salvation to the
living, but saviors for our ancestors who went before us and who, though now dead, have paved
the way whereby we might receive our present blessings.  It is through them we received our
priesthood.  The promise was made that even if they were born at a time and place where they
could not hear the gospel preached in life, God would provide saviors for them from among their
descendants.  We are those saviors God promised through whom they can have every priesthood
blessing."  (Ensign, May 1975, p.71.)  So spoke Elder Theodore M. Burton.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>To all of those who have preceded us on the military battlefields or in the daily challenges of
living a faithful life, we say, "we know you are watching us.  We know you will judge us.  We
promise to do our very best to carry on the great heritage you have passed on to us."<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p><b>ENHANCE AND IMPROVE OUR OWN GENERATIONAL FOUNDATIONS</b><br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Lastly, accept by willing performance, your obligation to teach, bless, correct and help your own
generation and that of others where you can.</p>
<p>In our home hang three documents framed in a single large frame and hung in a prominent place. 
The first is The Family Proclamation to the World; the second, The Living Christ; and the third,
the Relief Society pronouncement defining the status and role of women.  We regard these three
documents as pillars of our belief and faith.  We read them frequently and measure ourselves
with them.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Time precludes us from reviewing them in detail.  But I wish to draw to your attention some of
their elements that might suggest ways to help you as you create and organize you own family
generations.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:700">The Family Proclamation;</span></p>
<p>In the Family Proclamation, by divine design, the duties of fathers and mothers are set forth. 
Fathers are to preside (that is to set in order, regulate and correct) in love and righteousness. 
"You preside at the meal table, at family prayer.  You preside at family home evening. and as
guided by the spirit of the Lord, you see that your children are actively taught correct principles. 
It is your place to give direction relating to all of family life." ( Fathers, Consider You Ways,
Church Pamphlet, p.4-5.)</p>
<p>Fathers are to provide the necessities of life.  This means the critically required basics of food,
appropriate and modest clothing, and shelter commensurate with the abilities and income of the
father.  He is likewise to provide protection for the family, meaning "more than locking the door
each night."  Fathers are to teach and fortify by urgent example, to ward off the epidemic of
worldly philosophies and to prevent distraction from, and indifference to, things of a lasting and
eternal nature.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Mothers' <em>primary</em> responsibility is to nurture the children, to bring up, train and care for them, to
promote the development of intellectual, emotional and spiritual capacities.  Her domain is the
home, free from the restraints of gainful employment, unless absolutely required, safe in the trust
and confidence that her husband will provide and protect her in carrying out her divine duty.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I read recently in a national magazine of a mother who left her husband and nine year old
daughter "to create a life of my own in nearby Manhattan."  She believes that by living apart and
seeking to "find out who I really was," she is a better mother by being available for important
occasions, having periodic dinners together, and offering counsel and help when asked.  As proof
of her being "a better mother since I left my child," she states, "My daughter and I now have a
wonderful relationship.  She's an independent, happy, confident young woman, in part because I
chose the freedom to grow up, over being a dysfunctional mother.  People still look down on me
because I bucked the traditional belief that says a mother's place is with her child, no matter
what.  But I didn't need to live with her to be a good parent."  (Newsweek, December 16, 2002,
p.14)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I find it hard to imagine a more flagrant abdication of parental responsibility than this.  "Parents
have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical
and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments
of God and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live."  Thus, have spoken the living
prophets of our day!<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>While fathers and mothers both have their individual responsibilities, they are nevertheless
"obligated to help one another as equal partners."  The worldly philosophy that marriage is a
50/50 proposition, is not true.  A successful marriage is more likely to happen when each
participant gives <span style="text-decoration: underline">all</span> he has and can to the success of the marriage, regardless of what the other
participant may contribute.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:700">The Living Christ</span></p>
<p>&quot;What greater witness can one have than the testimony of 15 living apostles of the Lord?  When I
read their testimonies of the Living Christ, my heart and soul reverberate with the words, "It's
true!  It's true!  It's true!"  These impressions of the Holy Ghost sink deeply into my soul for
through that power, "the truth is woven into the very fiber and sinews of the body so that it
cannot be forgotten." (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:48.)  How grateful we should be to have that sure
witness of Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:700">Relief Society Pronouncement on Women:</span></p>
<p>Today's society obscures and blurs the position and role of women.  President Ezra Taft Benson
has said, "You have been elected by God to perform a unique and sacred work....It is divinely
ordained what a woman should do, but a man must seek out his work.  The divine work of
women involves companionship, homemaking and motherhood....  You were not created to be
the same as men.  Your natural attributes, affections, and personalities are entirely different from
those of a man.  They consist of faithfulness, benevolence, kindness and charity.  They give you
the personality of a woman."  (The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, p.547-548.) </p>
<p>In a recent General Relief Society meeting, Sister Sheri L. Dew gave this counsel.  "Everyone of
us has an overarching obligation to model righteous womanhood because our youth may not see
it anywhere else.  How will our young women learn to live as women of God unless they see
what women of God look like, meaning what we wear, watch and read; how we fill out time and
our minds; how we face temptation and uncertainty; where we find true joy, and why modesty
and femininity are hallmarks of righteous women?"  (Ensign, Nov. 2001, 96.)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>What a vibrant and edifying reminder to read and ponder the wonderment of womanhood as set
forth in that great Relief Society document!<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:700">Serving Others:</span></p>
<p>Where our skills and talents may be used to bless others than just our own, we have an obligation
to do so.</p>
<p>While serving with me in South Africa, Sister Wood learned that through the generosity of a
member of the Church in Salt Lake, a number of keyboards could be made available to members
in our area.  In the black township of Soweto, few members had any kind of musical training. 
When Ann learned of this, with the permission of the stake president, she began traveling to the
Soweto ward to teach as many students as could be accommodated with the keyboards.</p>
<p>Every Tuesday, a missionary couple would drive her to the chapel where she would begin
teaching them as a group, the rudiments and technical foundations of music, i.e. how to read
music, metrical headings, meters, measures, time signatures and downbeats, and how to play
hymns from the beginning book for the course.  Then each student would retire to a different
room for a period of personal practice on their own keyboard.  She would then move from room
to room, listening, correcting and helping each student.  She gave similar instructions to those
who wanted to lead and direct music.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Some students struggled.  It was not easy for all of them.  Gradually, the fruits of effort matured. 
Prelude music began to be played more frequently before meetings began.  A very small
repertoire of hymns could be sung to new accompaniments.  There were more choristers who
could count and lead with correct time signatures.  Choristers and accompanists took turns,
mistakes were forgiven, and growth and progress were so obvious that the whole congregation
became a supporting and rooting section for their newborn musicians.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Other couple missionaries began doing the same thing in other mission locations, and recently, a
couple has been called to carry on this musical training in Africa where students now number in
the hundreds.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>There is so much each one of us can do with the gifts with which the Lord has blessed us if we
can catch the vision and open our hearts to those who have so much less or whose needs can so
easily be met by our willingness to share.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I conclude my remarks with a reminder that each one of us bears the responsibility of
establishing strong generational foundations.  At my age, my work will soon be done. You are at
least two generations younger and have almost all of your lives ahead of you to do this great
work.  President Gordon B. Hinckley speaks of your generation with much love and admiration,
but with a very pointed reminder that with your great blessings comes enormous responsibility. 
He says, "You are great young people.  I have said again and again, we have the finest generation
of young people ever in the history of this Church.  I believe it....Never forget that you were
chosen and brought to earth as a child of God for something of importance in His grand design. 
He expects marvelous things of you.  He expects you to keep your lives clean from the sins of the
world.  <em>You are the line through which will pass the qualities of your forebears to the posterity
who will come after you."</em>  (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley, p.714 and 712.)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>May we feel and accept the great responsibility that is ours to pass on to succeeding generations a
noble and righteous heritage, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px"><font color="#000080">I spent a semester in Mexico during my senior year of high school.  Weekdays found me studying
hard at a university in Guadalajara.  Weekends found me touring the Yucat&aacute;n, San Miguel de
Allende, Puerto Vallarta, and Mazatl&aacute;n.  One day I was on my own exploring a huge park in
Mexico City.  I was thoroughly enjoying the sights and sounds--and the feeling of maturity at
being alone in a foreign country.  With my rudimentary Spanish skills, I stopped at a cart where a
man was selling soft drinks and bought an icy-cold glass bottle of Fanta Orange.  I thanked the
man, turned, and strolled off. </font></p>
<p>After about 30 seconds, I became aware that someone was making a hissing noise at me.  
		<em>Hiss. </em>Teasing American tourists is a common game, so I ignored the pest.  I kept my eyes straight
ahead and pretended that I hadn't heard.  The hiss got louder, so I knew the person was following
me.  I walked a little faster.  So did the hiss.  In fact, I quickly realized that, if I didn't break into
a run, the hiss would soon be upon me.  Finally, summoning my courage, I took a deep breath
and turned to confront my pursuer.  It was the Fanta man; he wanted his bottle back. I was
supposed to have drunk the Fanta at his cart--and he had been chasing me for several blocks. 
You see, the hiss is a way of calling attention in Mexico, much like the whistle is in the United
States.  But I hadn't known that, so I didn't respond the way I should have done.
		</p>
<p>That experience reminds me of a story in the Old Testament.  As you will recall, Hannah had
been barren for many years.  One day, while worshipping at the temple in Jerusalem, Hannah
covenanted with the Lord that, if he would grant her a son, she would consecrate the child to the
Lord.  Well, Hannah was blessed with a son, Samuel.  And, when he was weaned (at perhaps
three years of age), she took him to Jerusalem, and left him with the High Priest at the temple.
There Samuel spent the rest of his childhood.</p>
<p><font color="#000080">One night, just after he went to bed, Samuel heard a voice calling him.  Thinking it was Eli, the
High Priest, he jumped up and ran to the man's bedroom.  Eli told him he hadn't called Samuel
and sent the young boy back to bed.  The same thing happened a second time. Samuel heard a
voice, ran to Eli, and was sent back to bed.  In 1 Samuel 3:7 we can pick up the story:</font></p>
<p><em>Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed
unto him.</em></p>
<p><em>And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said,
Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou
shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his
place.</em></p>
<p><em>And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then
Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</em></p>
<p>When I was walking through that lovely park in Mexico City, I heard a call, but I didn't
recognize the significance of it--and I didn't respond the way the Fanta salesman had hoped I
would.  I just kept right on walking down the street.  In a similar fashion, when Samuel was
trying to fall asleep that night at the temple, he heard a call, but he didn't recognize the
significance of it--nor did he respond the way the Lord had hoped he would.  He just kept
walking into Eli's room.  Sometimes we have to be taught to recognize a call, and we have to be
taught how to respond.  This especially pertains to things of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Now, it is perfectly true that sometimes there are visits from heavenly beings who introduce
themselves, announce their missions, and deliver their messages.  But usually the Lord doesn't
provide us with such dramatic evidences of His will.  Typically, He speaks to us through the
Spirit.  And hearing the voice of the Spirit isn't quite like hearing a voice with your ears.  You
may remember the passage in 1 Kings 19:11-12, where Elijah learns that the voice of the Lord
isn't like a wind or an earthquake or a fire.  The voice of the Lord is "a still, small voice."	
		</p>
<p>And sometimes it isn't a "voice" at all!  Often it seems more like a feeling or an impression. 
You may remember the passage in Doctrine and Covenants 9:8-9, where Oliver Cowdery was
told that the Spirit would cause his bosom to "burn within."</p>
<p>I was asked to speak at today's Devotional just before Thanksgiving.  Immediately, the topic of
"Recognizing the Spirit" came into my mind.  With so much lead time, I decided to review the
many different ways I have "heard" the Spirit.  Every day during January, I took out a notebook
and wrote down one incident.  If we had several hours, I could tell you about all 31
experiences--a veritable Baskin Robbins of 31 flavors.  But we don't.  So today I will present a
dozen ways, in no particular order, that I have heard the Spirit speak.  Some of them may seem
familiar; you may have heard the Spirit that way, too.  Others may be new--or maybe you just
haven't recognized the Spirit when it has spoken to you that way.</p>
<p><strong>Ants Crawling Up Your Back</strong></p>
<p>During my mission, I was often blessed with the opportunity of teaching the gospel to children. 
Ram&oacute;n, a dark-haired, bright-eyed beauty, was one of my <em>many</em> favorites.  He and his mother,
Elvira, along with his Aunt Aurora, heard the discussions, read the Book of Mormon, and
accepted the baptismal challenge.  The date was set for the last Friday in February.  With great
excitement, we called the Mission Home and asked to have the portable pila (or font) sent from
Madrid to La Coru&ntilde;a.</p>
<p>On the Sunday just before the baptism, all of the Saints in Galicia traveled to Santiago de
Compostela for a Regional Conference.  While the meetings were warm spiritually, the train to
and from Santiago was not.  And Elvira caught a cold. She became absolutely terrified at the
thought of climbing into a rubber tub of frigid water.  She decided to wait.  Ram&oacute;n and Aurora,
however, wanted to be baptized on Friday. And they were!</p>
<p>The Sunday following the baptism was a Fast Sunday.  Because his mother was hesitating on
getting baptized, eight-year-old Ram&oacute;n rose to bear a sweet testimony of how he had come to
know the Church was true.  He told how "las Hermanas" (the Sisters) had taught him about the
Book of Mormon and had read him Moroni 10:4-5, often called "Moroni's Promise:"</p>
<p><em>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the
Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with
a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it
unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</em></p>
<p><em>And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.</em></p>
<p>My companion stressed the importance and the power of prayer.  One night shortly thereafter,
Ram&oacute;n had a high fever.  Trusting in what he'd been taught, Ram&oacute;n knelt and prayed that his
illness might be taken away--and it was!  The next morning, Moncho was surprised to find
himself completely healthy.  He decided to pray again, this time to see if the Book of Mormon
was true.  Now, remember, Ram&oacute;n was eight.  With childlike faith, that beautiful boy knelt by
his bed and offered a simple prayer.  As Ram&oacute;n described it during the testimony meeting, after
his prayer, he felt "ants crawling up the back."  Ram&oacute;n recognized that tingling feeling as a
manifestation of the Spirit and thus gained a testimony of the Book of Mormon--and of The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>Now, in English, we probably wouldn't describe that tingling sensation as "ants crawling up our
backs."  We might talk about something "sending shivers down our spine," "causing us goose
bumps," or even "giving us the chills."  But, whatever we call it, one way I have come to
recognize the Spirit is when I get goose bumps.  Or, as Ram&oacute;n put it, when I feel "ants crawling
up my back!" </p>
<p><strong>Assurance of the Heart</strong></p>
<p>My parents adopted three children--not all at once, mind you; over a period of four or five years. 
Thus, I have precious memories of my first three temple trips; I was 4 when Shanna was sealed to
our family, 6 when Lisa was sealed, and 10 when Darren was sealed.  In fact, to attend Darren's
sealing, since I was over age 8, I actually had to obtain a temple recommend  I remember being
interviewed by the Bishop the week before we went.  I can also remember many little details
about the temple: the games in the children's waiting area, the beautiful white clothing we put
on, the labyrinth of halls, and, of course, the sealing room.  Like all sealing rooms, it was
lovely--with a stone altar, velvet cushions, a breathtaking chandelier, and those incredible
eternity mirrors.  The room was filled with people dressed in white: relatives, friends, the sealer,
and, of course, our parents.  After some brief instructions, the entire family knelt around the altar
and joined hands.  I remember the feelings I had as my parents and the six children encircled that
altar.  I felt safe. Whole. Complete.  Encircled by the arms of love. </p>
<p>The chapter synopsis for 2 Corinthians, Chapter 1, mentions that the "Saints are sealed and given
assurance by the Spirit in their hearts."  In Galatians 5:22-23, Paul talks about the specific
feelings the Holy Ghost puts in our hearts, naming love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance.</p>
<p>When our family was sealed, I felt an assurance in my heart.  Perhaps you have felt that same
assurance when your family has knelt in a circle--if not around an altar to be sealed, at least in
prayer.  I know I do  Especially if my mother is offering the prayer; her words truly seem to reach
unto heaven.  At such times, the Spirit gives an assurance to my heart.  And that's a second way
I've come to recognize the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Belly of the Whale</strong></p>
<p>One of my favorite Primary songs is "Follow the Prophet " Whenever I hear it, I have the urge to
grab a tambourine and dance the Hora.  Because I have an odd sense of humor, I especially like
the verse about Jonah, which says:</p>
<p><em>Jonah was a prophet, tried to run away,<br />But he later learned to listen and obey.<br />When we really try, the Lord won't let us fail;<br />That's what Jonah learned deep down inside the whale.<br />Follow the prophet!</em></p>
<p>Whenever I sing that verse, I get giggling about the juxtaposition of the lines; after we're told
that Jonah went "down deep inside the whale," we are told to follow him!  And, yet, I suppose
that most of us do, at some point or another, follow Jonah into one of those "belly of the whale"
experiences where we refuse to hearken to the Lord until He compels us to be humble. 
		</p>
<p>I was the "Fourth Period Seminary Class President" one year, which more or less meant that I
coordinated the opening exercises each day, asking students to play the piano, lead the singing,
offer the prayer, and read a scripture.  As it happened, there were two girls in the class who
talked loudly throughout the entire period, and they especially liked to mock students who were
participating in the devotional.  One day, in front of the entire class, I rudely asked the teacher to
make them be quiet.  Immediately, I knew that what I had done was mean and that I ought to
apologize.  But I felt they deserved it, so I refused to listen to my conscience. 
		</p>
<p>Days went by, then weeks, and I was constantly troubled by the vague sense that something was
wrong.  I felt sick.  My stomach hurt.  I was miserable.  I'm not just talking about 
		<em>not</em> feeling the
Spirit--like when the Spirit is absent.  Jonah's description of the belly of the whale--which he
also called the belly of hell--isn't just about being alone.  Jonah talks about the water
encompassing his soul and the weeds wrapped around his head.  He felt awful.</p>
<p>It took Jonah three days and three nights before he was humbled sufficiently to utter the words
recorded in Jonah 2:9, "I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving."  Then, in verse
10, the whale "vomited out Jonah upon the dry land."  I was a bit more stubborn.  I'm sure that a
month or more passed before I finally relented and called the girls to apologize.  And, after being
"vomited" on the beach by that whale, I immediately felt better.  A weight was lifted. 
		</p>
<p>Now, I don't really like it when the Spirit pricks my conscience, but I do seem to bring it about. 
Fortunately, when I finally recognize that my miserable condition is the Spirit working on me, I
usually do repent.  And I always feel better afterwards.  In fact, every time I have spent a few
hours--or days, or weeks--in the belly of the whale being worked over by the Spirit, I later
wonder why I wouldn't repent sooner!  And that's a third way I've come to recognize the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Watering Eyes</strong></p>
<p>I love the Book of Mormon stories about Ammon and his missionary work among the Lamanites. 
You probably remember how Ammon cut off the arms of the thugs who were trying to steal King
Lamoni's sheep.  He later taught the gospel to the King, who was so overcome that he fell to the
earth as if dead.  In Alma 19:13-14, King Lamoni arose and told his wife that he had seen Jesus
Christ, who would "redeem all mankind who believe on his name."  At that point, "the queen
also sunk down, being overpowered by the Spirit."  This caused Ammon to fall upon his knees
and to pour out his soul in prayer and thanksgiving to God, "and he was also overpowered with
joy; and thus they all three had sunk to the earth."  I, too, have felt the spirit as an overpowering
of joy.  However, in my experiences, this has not resulted in a state of unconsciousness.  For me,
it has usually resulted in watering eyes. </p>
<p>Since 1999, I have been privileged to participate in 4 Hosanna Shouts through broadcasts.  Three
were for temples: Winter Quarters, Palmyra, and Nauvoo.  Those were special occasions which I
shall not soon forget.  The Spirit was strong--and unique--at each dedicatory service.  And to
stand in chapels with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of Saints to give the Shout was, wow,
tremendous. </p>
<p>But I would like to bring to remembrance the fourth time: the day the Hosanna Shout was given
for the new Conference Center.  Some of you may have been at the Conference Center that day.  I
was not.  I was watching that session of General Conference at the home of a friend.  It surprised
us that a Hosanna Shout would be done on network television, and you may recall how the
Prophet asked the media to treat the event with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>Lidia and I stood in her living room and participated in that joyous event.  I remember that the
camera panned out across the 20,000 Saints gathered in the Conference Center, and that was
certainly impressive.  But my thoughts were turned to the many thousands of homes around the
country--around the <em>world</em>--where one or two, or even a half-dozen, faithful Saints were
standing in front of their television sets to given the Hosanna Shout.  They, too, were a part of the
congregation of Israel.  About then the tears started flowing.  I was wanting to shout with my
whole soul, and there I was--overcome by the Spirit, eyes watering and voice croaking.</p>
<p>I should hasten to point out that a great many of you feel the Spirit this fourth way, too.  I have a
campus Church assignment, and I have visited many of your wards.  I have watched you speak
and bear testimonies.  I've seen you crying and sniffling into the microphone--so don't bother
denying it.  I hope you recognize the Spirit's role in those watering eyes.  And just be glad that
you haven't been so overpowered with joy that you were rendered unconscious at the pulpit!</p>
<p><strong>Loose Tongue</strong></p>
<p>It's interesting that the Spirit can leave a person unable to speak, for the Holy Ghost can also put
words into a person's mouth.  In Doctrine and Covenants 11:21, we read, "Seek not to declare
my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you
desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word yea, the power of God unto the convincing of
men."</p>
<p>In one of my college wards, I was the Gospel Doctrine teacher.  As part of a lesson on trials and
tribulation, I planned an activitiy where the class members anonymously wrote their "greatest
trial" on pieces of paper and placed them in a basket.  I read the slips aloud and wrote their
responses on the board, grouping them by category.  As I did so, I discovered that stories kept
popping into my head--examples to illustrate the trials listed by the class members.  It was like
little sparks were igniting in my brain in random order, illuminating and connecting my
experiences and theirs. </p>
<p>After the lesson, I was surprised to discover that I had no clear recollection of what I had said. 
When people stopped me to comment on particular stories that had been meaningful for them, I
could only smile vaguely; I didn't even remember <em>telling</em> the stories!  Others mentioned the warm
glow they'd felt--that whole burning bosom thing.  Yet I had felt nothing! </p>
<p>I am told that when some people teach by the Spirit, their hearts race.  Others feel butterflies in
their stomachs.  Not me.  I just experience rapid, seemingly random, associations, and my tongue
is turned loose.  I've come to recognize the Spirit in that, the fifth, way.</p>
<p><strong>A Whack on the Side of the Head</strong></p>
<p>In the first city where I served during my mission, I had a native companion.  Because she was
helping the Church to grow in her homeland, Hermana Arriaga radiated a special intensity for the
work.  Together we had great success; we taught several people who were baptized and had many
investigators.  One night the President called--rather late--and instructed us to be on the first
train to Salamanca the next morning.  He was sending us to open a new city for work by sister
missionaries.  While that may <em>sound</em> quite thrilling, my companion and I were actually quite
bothered by the mid-month transfer.   Since we were both leaving, neither of us would be around
to follow up with our investigators.  Therefore, we had to leave copious notes explaining about
the progress of each and every one.  We also had to pack, which took hours.  Then we had to
decide what to do with the groceries we had just bought to see us through the month.  We opted
to take them with us, so we loaded everything into plastic bags.</p>
<p>After a couple of hours of sleep, we went to the train station, climbed aboard, had the other
passengers help us find room for our suitcases and 10 (yes, ten) bags of groceries, and then
collapsed in our seats.  As we pulled out of the station, we noticed the train schedule on the wall
and saw that a train left each hour--on the hour--for Salamanca.  What was the big deal about
being on the first one???  We hadn't even had time to tell any of the members or our
investigators that we were leaving.  We were frustrated, tired, and in a grumbling mood. 
		</p>
<p>After a few minutes of complaining, my companion suggested that we hold our companionship
study session.  We had packed our scriptures near the surface, so we grabbed them.  We then
realized that our study guide and reference books were in cases under other people's seats, and
we weren't about to inconvenience all of the other passengers (again) to dig them out.  Hermana
Arriaga suggested that we just read aloud.  So, we flipped open our scriptures at random--no,
they fell open--and we began to read--I'm not kidding--Section 111 of the Doctrine and
Covenants, which says:</p>
<p><em>I, the Lord your God, am not displeased with your coming this journey, notwithstanding
your follies.</em></p>
<p><em>I have much treasure in this city for you, for the benefit of Zion, and 
many people in this city whom I will gather out in due time for the benefit of 
Zion, through your instrumentality. . . . </em></p>
<p>It goes on and on, but we'll skip to verse 10:</p>
<p><em>For there are more treasures than one for you in this city.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, be ye as wise as serpents and yet without sin; and I will 
order all things for your good, as fast as ye are able to receive them. Amen.</em></p>
<p>Well, that impressed us.  Deeply.  We knew the Lord was speaking directly to us through the
scriptures.  We immediately stopped our complaining.  President Theodore Roosevelt introduced
a clever little adage into our culture; he said, "Speak softly and carry a big stick."  I don't
suppose he meant this in a spiritual sense, but we do sometimes refer to the scriptures as sticks. 
And, metaphorically speaking, I would have to agree that the Spirit speaks softly and carries a big
stick, with which He often whacks me on the side of the head--a sixth way.</p>
<p><strong>Heart Stopped</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the Lord speaks to us by taking action in the physical world.  You may recall the
story of the early Saints not paying their tithing; the subsequent drought manifested God's
feelings.  You may also recall the story in John 21:6-7, when Christ appeared to his Apostles in
Galilee after His resurrection.  The Apostles were out fishing, and Christ told them to "Cast the
net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find."  When they did as He said, their nets were
filled so they could not draw them in "for the multitude of fishes."  Yes, the Lord can manipulate
objects and events as a way of speaking to us. </p>
<p>In Salamanca, Hermana Arriaga and I quickly found families to teach.  After several weeks, one
was on the verge of committing to baptism. They were at that point where it feels as though the
adversary is going to pounce at any moment.  One evening, we had an appointment to teach
them.  We arrived a few minutes before the scheduled hour and found no one home.  We waited,
patiently, until half-past.  Then we decided, sadly, that we should start walking to our next
appointment.  We wrote the family a note, tucked it in the crack of the door, and stepped into the
elevator to descend the six floors to street level.  When the doors closed, I pushed the big black
button for the ground floor. </p>
<p>We went, oh, maybe a floor or two, and the elevator stopped--so did our hearts!  My companion
and I suspected the Lord was trying to get our attention.  We decided to wait just a little longer,
so we returned to the sixth floor.  In less than five minutes, the family came bustling out of the
elevator, thrilled that we had waited because they really needed to see us. </p>
<p>Sometimes the Spirit startles us--makes our hearts stop even--as a seventh way to get our
attention.  I have learned not to dismiss such things as "coincidence."</p>
<p><strong>Powerful Hands</strong></p>
<p>On the eve of my sixteenth birthday, I received my Patriarchal Blessing.  The Patriarch had asked
that I come fasting, which I did.  I remember many things about the hour I spent with Patriarch
Thompson.  I remember the warmth of his humble home.  I remember the kindness of his
gracious wife.  I remember that he forgot to turn on the tape recorder so that he had to give the
blessing twice!  And I remember the feeling of power emanating from his hands to my head and
spreading through my entire body.  It was real.  It was tangible. </p>
<p>It makes me think of the story of Nephi when Laman and Lemuel were mocking his ship-
building efforts.  In 1 Nephi 17:52, we learn that the Spirit of God was with him.  Picking up in
verse 53, we read:</p>
<p><em>And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thine hand again unto thy
brethren, and they shall not wither before thee, but I will shock them, saith the Lord, and
this will I do, that they may know that I am the Lord their God.</em></p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying the Patriarch's hands "shocked" me, but I did feel energy--power--coming
from them.  It was real.  And I have felt the Spirit in this eighth way--as a power in the
hands--many times since then as I have participated in and performed sacred ordinances in the
temple.</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants 76:12, a description of yet another way the Spirit works is given: "By
the power of the Spirit our eyes were opened and our understandings were enlightened, so as to
see and understand the things of God."</p>
<p>Three years ago, my paternal grandmother passed away.  She had struggled with poor physical
health and declining mental stability in her later years.  However, in her younger days, Grandma
had been an avid genealogist.  When several of my distant cousins were cleaning out sheds on
her property, they found a trunk full of genealogy.  They weren't interested in the papers, but they
recognized the potential value--so they called my father.</p>
<p>Within days, I had the aqua-colored trunk, with glittery sparkles embedded in its padded vinyl
cover, sitting in my kitchen.  I opened it to discover thousands of moldy, old genealogy
forms--the long kind, where the ordinance work was stamped on a grid at the right-hand side.
Much of the work had been started, but most of the pages had <em>many</em> empty squares.  Because the
smell was almost overwhelming, I wrapped the trunk in several garbage bags.  Then I called
Church Headquarters to see what we should do.  They offered to have missionaries at the Family
History Center in Salt Lake verify that the work had been finished; however, they said they
would be ever-so-grateful if we would do it.</p>
<p>It took my mother and me several months (and a good deal of allergy medicine) to type the
30,000 names into the computer, but we did it.  Then we checked the names against the various
indexes to see if the work had been completed by others during the 60 years the trunk had sat in
the apparently quite leaky shed.  We discovered that roughly 90% of the people whose names we
had found had been baptized, confirmed, endowed, and sealed--but 10% had not.  We printed
cards for them--enough cards to fill a shoebox.  Then I began recruiting help.</p>
<p>Some of you were in my classes two years ago when we did the 3000 baptisms.  Oh, what a
spiritual feast we had together in the temple!  What a delight it was to watch my students and
friends perform those sacred ordinances for my family members.  Even President Tucker came
down to help, sitting in as proxy.  I have many special memories of the impressions you had
about my ancestors, which a number of you shared with me. </p>
<p>Because a few of you had already been endowed, we were able to perform the initiatory
ordinances (which go rather quickly) on hundreds of names.  However, we weren't able to get
very many endowment sessions completed--a handful, but nowhere near 3000.</p>
<p>Then, last winter, the Matron announced in our preparation meeting that the Idaho Falls Temple
had almost run out of names for endowment sessions.  We were asked to encourage patrons to
help out in the initiatory area until we had a cushion of names built up again.  Because I had that
shoebox full of cards, I dropped by the office and offered them to the Recorder.  He was eager to
use them.  Since I work in the Temple each Tuesday evening, I took five or six hundred (which
had the initiatory done) with me the next week.  The sisters working in the office told me they
would stamp them "Return to Recorder's Office" and use them--probably by that Saturday, as
they were really low on names by then.  They thanked me for offering my family names for
temple use, and I assured them I was happy to help out.</p>
<p>The next week, when I arrived at the temple, I was told that my names had not been finished on
Saturday; they were still being handed out.  That evening, the sessions were all full, with no
empty chairs.  And almost every patron was acting as proxy for one of my family members.  As it
happens, one of my assignments was to accompany a session as the sister who sits at the front,
making sure that the patrons' needs are met.  Mere words cannot convey what it was like to
watch 150 Saints stand and make sacred covenants for my ancestors.  Some of you were there
that night; you've stopped me to tell me you'd read my name on the card as the person
submitting the work.  So, I am comfortable telling you that, from my vantage point at the front of
the congregation looking out at the patrons, the walls in the ordinance rooms were, hmmm, rather
transparent that night.  The Spirit opened my eyes, and I was granted a glimpse of eternity that I
shall not soon forget.  And that's a ninth way the Spirit speaks to me.  Oh, you'll be happy to
know that my cousins and I have spent the past year getting our ancestors sealed into families.  
		</p>
<p><strong>Warned in a Dream</strong></p>
<p>The scriptures contain many stories where the Spirit spoke to people in dreams. Sometimes the
meaning was clear--like when Joseph was warned to take Mary and Jesus into Egypt to keep
them safe.  Other times, the dreams required an interpreter--like when another Joseph explained
to Pharaoh that years of plenty would be followed by years of famine.  Whether they were easily
understood or not, dreams sent by the Spirit were recognized by the receivers as true dreams.</p>
<p>Dreaming is a lot like watching television.  I am sure that at some point in your life you have
walked into a room where "Wheel of Fortune" was playing on the television.  You looked at the
screen and saw pieces of a puzzle, the letters that had been revealed.  Instantly, you saw the
solution, yet the players on the show weren't getting it.  Then you were called away to answer the
phone or something, and you didn't get to see the ending of the show.  But it didn't matter.  You
had the answer.  You knew it.  You <em>knew </em>you were right, even though you left before the full
answer was revealed.  That certainty, that's the feeling you wake up with when the Spirit has
spoken to you through a dream.</p>
<p>Almost a year ago, I was asked to accept an administrative assignment on campus.  The night
before the "invitation" was extended, I had a dream about the assignment.  Hours before I got the
phone call, I knew what was coming and what the Lord expected me to do.  Like many before
me, I was "warned in a dream," which is the tenth way.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligence Flowing into the Mind </strong></p>
<p>Full-time missionaries are expected to study the scriptures for an hour each day.  In English, our
Church uses the King James version of the Bible.  In Spanish, our Church uses the Reina Valera. 
And it is a beautiful version, lyrical even.  One day, my companion and I were studying a passage
where the Spanish translation held a different meaning than the English translation.  If you've
studied another language, then you realize that some languages have a keener ability to express a
certain nuance than others.  In this particular case, the difference was substantial, and I wondered
which version was closer to the original language.  I decided to dig into the footnotes during my
individual scripture study in order to solve the mystery.  I did not find a complete answer that
day, so subsequent study periods found me searching again and again.  To no avail.  Apparently,
the clarification I needed was not to be found in English or Spanish.  Yet I had no other printed
sources available to aid my study.  But I did have prayer. </p>
<p>Enos tells us, in Enos 1:10, that his prayer was answered with a "voice in his mind " And so it
was with me!  One brisk Spanish morning, as I neared the end of what had seemed to be another
fruitless search for answers, I suddenly felt knowledge flow into my mind.  It was as though a
floodgate had been opened and pure intelligence poured in, clarifying the passages I had been
studying for days.  The insights came so quickly and with such depth that I struggled to
assimilate the information.  I remember closing my eyes and asking the Lord to "slow down"
because I could not comprehend all that I was being taught at such an incredible speed.  It is
wonderful to know that God will provide answers to those who seek.  In 1 Nephi 10:19, Nephi
explains, "For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded
unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost. . ." </p>
<p>I have had the Spirit teach me as a voice--or intelligence--flowing directly into my mind.  This
is an eleventh way I recognize the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Through Another's Voice</strong></p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball was the prophet during my teenage and early adult years.  I
remember him with the same fondness that you undoubtedly hold for President Hinckley.  Each
morning, as I climb the stairs to my office in the Kimball Building, I am greeted by the gently
smiling portrait of President Kimball.  On either side of the painting are plaques with quotes. The
one on the far right has an excerpt from a 1974 <em>Ensign. </em>It says, "God does notice us, and he
watches over us.  But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs."  I have
noticed that it is often through another person that His voice is heard, as well.  But, as we are
taught in Doctrine and Covenants 1:38, whether a message comes through His own voice or by
the voice of His servants, "It is the same."</p>
<p>Students frequently drop by to let me know about their mission calls.  I always congratulate
them, hug them, and ask to tell me all of the juicy details.  At least once a semester, I'll have a
student drop by who I didn't realize was planning a mission.  When I express surprise, usually
the student will laugh and say something like this: "Oh, I wasn't planning to go.  One
Wednesday, I just prayed and asked the Lord what I should do with my life.  The next day,
Thursday, I got a letter from a friend on a mission, and he was really pumped up about
missionary work.  Friday, my Religion class talked about missions.  Saturday, my FHE brothers
came by to tell us that one of them had received his mission call.  Sunday, the Sacrament
Meeting talks were both on missionary work, and the Relief Society lesson was on supporting
missionaries.  Then, after Church, the Bishop called me in and asked if I'd considered a mission.
I realized the Lord was sending me a message, so I decided to go."</p>
<p>I have had many experiences in this twelfth way, as well; the Spirit has prompted others to speak
to me--and, thus, I have heard the Lord's will through their voices.  Take this talk, for instance. 
Knowing I should talk about recognizing the Spirit, I prayed for guidance.  At the temple one
evening in December, Sisters kept approaching me to share insights on this topic--sisters who
did not even know that I was working on a Devotional talk.  I recognized the Lord was answering
my prayer and sending His servants to tell me what He wanted me to know. One dear sister
stressed the importance of being still, of providing the Spirit with quiet moments to speak to us
in his still, small voice.  Another talked about finding answers in the scriptures. Others shared
heart-warming stories of impressions they had had.  It was a special evening for me, though
others listening in on our conversations probably didn't hear anything extraordinary.</p>
<p>But that's how it was with Samuel, too.  That beautiful little boy, who would become a great
prophet, heard what Eli did not.  In the old, blue hymn book that I grew up using, there was a
song about Samuel, called "Hushed Was the Evening Hymn."  One of the verses went like this:</p>
<p><em>O give me Samuel's ear,<br />The open ear, O Lord,<br />Alive and quick to hear<br />Each whisper of thy word.</em></p>
<p>You may not hear "whispered words," but the Spirit will speak to you--perhaps in one of the
dozen ways I have discussed: as ants crawling up your back, as an assurance in the heart, as a
miserable feeling as you sit in the belly of the whale, as watering eyes, as a loose tongue, as a
whack on the side of the head, as a stopping of the heart, as powerful hands, as spiritual eyes that
are opened, as a warning in a dream, as intelligence flowing directly into your mind, or through
another's voice.  Of course, I also had another 19 ways recorded in my journal.  Maybe you've
recognized the Spirit in a way I didn't mention.  Then again, maybe you should make your own
journal; perhaps you've recognized the Spirit in a way I never have!</p>
<p>At Christmas, I visited my parents in Buhl, Idaho.  On Sunday, my mother and I attended the
Gospel Doctrine class for the final Old Testament lesson on Zechariah and Malachi.  At one
point, the teacher read Zechariah 10:8, which says, "I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I
have redeemed them."  Brother Millington drew attention to the word "hiss."  He commented
that he wasn't sure what "hissing" to the ends of the earth would be like or how anyone would
hear it.  He asked if someone could shed light on the concept.  I immediately remembered my
experience with the Fanta salesman while I was in Mexico. </p>
<p>I did one of those "ooh, ooh, call on me" gestures and told them the story.  I explained that the
hiss is quiet, yet very distinctive; it can be heard on a crowded bus, in a busy subway, or in a
spacious park.  In fact, once I knew what to listen for, I noticed Mexicans calling each other that
way all the time.  And so it is with the Spirit.  Once you know what to listen for, you'll hear it all
the time.  It is my prayer that each of us will learn to recognize the Spirit and respond
appropriately to the promptings we are given.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My young brethren and sisters, I am happy to be here today. I&#8217;ve worried a lot about you, and I
hope you&#8217;ve worried just a little bit about me. If you haven&#8217;t, you can begin to worry right now!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It&#8217;s a great honor to be here.  I&#8217;ve had the privilege&#8211;I am a little reluctant to even mention this-but I&#8217;ve been here four times before.  I was here back in 1990 and 1992 and again in 1993.  And
then five years ago I was here.  Now, some of you slow learners might have been here in 1990
when I came, so I&#8217;ll try not to repeat myself.  You know I have a copy of all the stories and
things I have told in these and other talks, and I read them the other day, and then I listened to
them on the tape.  I got sick all over wondering what in the world I might tell you.  So I thought
I&#8217;d better make up a few new stories for this group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I&#8217;m getting to be an old man, as you can tell, those of you who are sitting fairly close.  But, I
enjoy being an old man.  I had a wonderful time when I was a boy.  I&#8217;ve had a good time through
every decade; and now I&#8217;m almost 85 years of age and I&#8217;m just having a great time because I&#8217;m
still active in the Church doing things I ought to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As I looked at all of you a few moments ago I remembered Perry Como, the very famous singer. 
He used to sing a song that said, &#8220;When you&#8217;re the father of boys, you worry; but when you&#8217;re
the father of girls, you do more than that: You pray.&#8221;  The reason I mention that to you is just to
tell each one of you here that I hope you&#8217;ve got a mother and a father, or grandparents, or
somebody who&#8217;s praying for you.  I&#8217;m sure they are.  I hope you&#8217;re so living your religion and
the things you&#8217;ve been taught so that their prayers will be answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I use to tell the story, in fact I still do, of the General Authority who gave a talk to a large group
like this and thought he did so wonderfully well.  When he got through he turned to his wife and
said, &#8220;How many really great men do you think there are in the world?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
have any idea, but there is one less than you think.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I remember hearing about the university president or the university professor who dreamed he
was giving a speech here in the Hart Auditorium, and woke up and found out he really was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now that I got that out of the way, I want to talk to you a little bit today about the 
		<i>Book of
Mormon</i>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The 
		<i>Book of Mormon</i> is a book that you should all be acquainted with.  It was published in 1830. 
Eleven days after the book was printed, the Church was organized.  It's been in the world now
for over 170 years.  And just two years ago, on the last day of February in the year 2000, the 100
millionth <i>Book of Mormon</i> was printed.  100 million!  When you stop and think about Church
history, read about the problems that the Prophet Joseph and the others had in getting that book
printed, I&#8217;m sure that one of the greatest miracles in the whole history of the world is the 
		<i>Book of
Mormon</i> itself.  100 million copies!  That book has converted and brought millions of people
into the Church, but there are millions of others who have rejected it and have gone their own
way without using it.  If you young people haven&#8217;t already learned to love the 
		<i>Book of Mormon</i>
and to appreciate it, now is the time to start.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I told my wife and my two sons (who are here; they are my personal body guards today to help
me get out of here without getting tarred and feathered), I told them to be sure and bring
scriptures with them because I was positive President Bednar would ask you to raise your
scriptures up.  I brought this little one and raised it up.  And I&#8217;m grateful I had one.  My wife had
one, and the boys had one.  And most all of you do.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The 
		<i>Book of Mormon</i> is such a magnificent book that it&#8217;s amazing to me that we don&#8217;t spend
more time with it and use it more.  If we could read a little bit every day, it would be a
marvelous thing.  When you have a day when you&#8217;re discouraged or a day when you have had a
&#8220;bad hair day&#8221;, or when you are going to have a test or have to give a big speech, read the 
		<i>Book
of Mormon</i>, just a page or two!  It&#8217;s amazing.  After you&#8217;ve read the 
		<i>Book of Mormon</i> and made
it a part of your life and a part of your heart and a part of your mind, then any single page will
lift you up and bless you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, I have with me today three Books of Mormon.  I have one here that my father gave me 65
years ago.  For over 40 years this book went on my missions and went with me around the
Church as I traveled.  I spent about 35 years traveling around the Church going to stake
conferences and other meetings, and I learned to love this book.  But the thing I loved most was
that my father, who was an inactive member of the Church and who at that time I thought he
didn&#8217;t even know there was such a thing as the <i>Book of Mormon</i>, my father gave me this book
and he wrote in it, &#8220;To Glen, from Dad, who is proud of you in your determination to do that
which you believe is right.&#8221;  Now, that book has helped me to try to do what is right.  This 
		<i>Book
of Mormon</i> is a treasure of mine.  I&#8217;ve gone through life gathering a lot of treasures.  
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have another 
		<i>Book of Mormon</i> here which came out about 1980.  It has some footnotes and
chapter headings in it, so I put my old book away.  For the last 22 years I&#8217;ve carried this book
with me almost everywhere I&#8217;ve gone.  In the back of it is a copy of my patriarchal blessing.  In
the front of it is a copy of the blessing I received from the First Presidency when I was ordained
a Seventy and set apart to be a General Authority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">These books have blessed me.  They have touched my life.  I have another book with me here
which I don&#8217;t know that you can see very well.  It&#8217;s a little tiny 
		<i>Book of Mormon</i>, and it is an
interesting book.  The only time it&#8217;s been worth anything was a few minutes ago when President
Bednar asked us to hold up our scriptures.  I held it up!  As far as I know it is the only 
		<i>Book of
Mormon</i> that has ever been in outer space.  James Lovell and Buzz Aldren (who have both been
on the moon) were the astronauts who flew in Gemini 12, which was launched in November of
1966.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When I was presiding over the Florida Mission, the Elders out on Cape Canaveral and in that
area bought this little book.  They all signed it, and then they gave it to Dr. Pincock, who was a
Latter-day Saint doctor and also the flight surgeon.  When Buzz Aldren and James Lovell were
put in the space capsule to go out around the world for the next two or three days, they took this
		<i>Book of Mormon</i> with them.  Dr. Pincock asked them to put it in their space suit.  He said, 
"When you splash down out in the middle of the Pacific, I&#8217;ll be the one there to open the hatch
and see if you&#8217;re both alive.  Before you get out, you&#8217;ll give me that book.  Don&#8217;t give it to
anyone else." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The missionaries got it from Dr. Pincock and then presented it to me as the president of the
mission.  Now this book sat on our mantelpiece, for about 15 years.  People looked at it. 
Everyone wanted to just pick it up.  You know this book is just something to look at, a novelty,
but it has never done a bit of good until a few minutes ago.  I needed it right then.  No one has
ever read this book.  This book has never touched anyone&#8217;s heart.  This book has never done a
single thing to upgrade or to help an individual.  It&#8217;s just a book that went around the world, time
and time again, several million miles for 94 hours and 33 minutes in outer space.  When it came
back the astronauts signed it, and then it was given to me.  As I said, it hasn&#8217;t done a bit of good. 
These other books have been wonderful; they have blessed my life; they have kept me on the
straight and narrow path; they have been with me night and day in airplanes and trains and ships. 
And wherever I&#8217;ve gone, they have been by me as companions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The 
		<i>Book of Mormon</i> has lots of uses.  I hope you use it properly.  I gave a speech one night in a
home in our ward where there were some inactive people who wanted to ask questions. As we
sat in a circle, I said to the lady of the house, &#8220;By any chance do you have a 
		<i>Book of Mormon</i>?&#8221; 
She said, &#8220;Oh yes, we have a big one.&#8221;  And she went over to the bookcase and among all the
books there was a nice <i>Book of Mormon</i>.  She handed it to me.  It was brand new and looked to
me like it had never been opened.  When I opened it (we were sitting in a circle), out of the 
		<i>Book
of Mormon</i> fell 20 or 25, $20 bills.  Four or five hundred dollars fell on the floor.  Her husband
almost fainted.  He jumped straight up, and she fainted.  She didn&#8217;t faint, but she got pale. 
Everybody looked, and there was not a sound.  She finally said, &#8220;I knew no one would ever read
that book so I've been hiding money in it, holding out on my husband.&#8221;  Well, she had used it as
a bank.  She had used it because she knew it was never going to be touched in her home.  I don&#8217;t
want any of you to use your <i>Book of Mormon</i> that way, it is not a bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I remember meeting a man down in Alabama years ago.  I went down to put him in charge of the
welfare work in that part of the world.  I said, &#8220;Stan, how did you get into the Church?&#8221;  He told
me he was a convert.  He said, &#8220;Well, when I was a young boy I worked for the city, and I
worked out at the city dumps.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;I was out one day, and they had just dumped a lot of
garbage, and my job was to spread it out.&#8221;  And he said, &#8220;Right on the top of a big pile laid a
book.  It had a picture on it.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;It looked brand new.  I picked that book up, and it
was brand new.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;It looked to me like no one had ever opened it, and it said on the
cover <i>Book of Mormon</i>.  He said, &#8220;I thought, this is too good to throw away, so I put it in my
back pocket and took it home.  I put it on the dresser in my bedroom, and I went to school the
next day and forgot about it.  When I came home, my mother was all upset.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Stan
where did you get the horrible book that is full of lies and terrible stories and awful things.  You
go get it right now and throw it in the garbage.&#8221;  Stan said, &#8220;That&#8217;s where I got it!&#8221;  She said,
&#8220;Whatever you do, promise me you won&#8217;t ever open it, or read it, or have anything to do with
it.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He said, &#8220;You know she made such a fuss.  She kept after me and made such a terrible fuss, that
I decided I better read it.  So, I read it.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;After I read it, I got a hold of the Elders
and I had them baptize me into the Church.&#8221;  At the time he told me this he was on the High
Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have friend who grew up in the Catholic Church with a desire to be a Catholic minister all of
his life.  He wanted to become a priest and a bishop.  The old Catholic father who taught him
prophesied.  He said, &#8220;Gary, if you&#8217;ll just live the way you ought to, someday you&#8217;ll be a priest
and someday you&#8217;ll be a bishop.&#8221;  Gary said, &#8220;I was headed for the ministry, and then just by
chance someone gave me a book called the <i>Book of Mormon</i>.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;I read that book.  I
knew it was true.  I got a hold of the Elders."  He said, &#8220;You know, believe it or not, I became a
priest.  I was baptized, and then I was a priest.&#8221;  Then he said, &#8220;A few years passed and I became
a bishop.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You know that old Catholic father really knew how to prophesy, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221; 
He said to me, &#8220;That book changed my whole life.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Today that man is not only a priest and bishop, but he is one of the General Authorities of the
Church presiding as a member of an area presidency in one of the foreign countries.  While I was
a General Authority, I toured his mission and had him tell me all of his stories about how he
grew up as a Catholic and what the <i>Book of Mormon</i> had really done for him.  
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">When you read the 
		<i>Book of Mormon</i>, you young people, I hope you'll meet individual people.  I
hope they are not just names on a page&#8211;Lehi, Nephi, King Benjamin, Mosiah, Alma the
Younger, Alma the Elder, and other great people like Abinadi and the brother of Jared.  You
know those were real people.  They did live.  They lived here on the American Continent.  You
know I hope someday in the hereafter I will be able to go to stake conference and hear some of
them preach.  No one has ever told me they are going to do that, but I've got an idea they will.  I
think we will be holding many conferences, and the Brethren that will come around speaking
will be men like Alma and King Benjamin and some of those others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, I have traveled for years and years with the modern prophets of God. Men like President
Harold B. Lee, who helped raise me and who married my wife and me and who was so good to
us.  Men like President Kimball, President Benson, President Hunter and President Romney.  I
traveled with these great men who led the church and went with them on many assignments.  I
traveled with President Hinckley, President Packer, President Monson, President Perry, Elder
Haight and President Faust.  These men are great men because of the <i>Book of Mormon</i>.  They are
what they are today because of the <i>Book of Mormon</i>.  So, I wanted to say something to you about
it.  I hope that you will just resolve in your heart to fall in love with this magnificent book. 
There is no other book in all the world like the Book Mormon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, I have a friend who is a sculptor. When he was a young man, he went on a mission.  While
he was on his mission, they had a little fair back in Des Moines, Iowa, and he sculptured a small
statue of the angel Moroni.  It was in the Church exhibit in the fair.  While he was there, Elder
Spencer W. Kimball, then of the Quorum of the Twelve, was in Iowa and he saw this little
sculpture and he shook hands with this young man.  He said to him, &#8220;Young man, you&#8217;ll do
much work for the Church.&#8221;  That little prophesy is coming true today because he is the man
who is sculpturing all of the Moroni&#8217;s that are being put on the small temples that are built all
around the world.  He recently did one for the Nauvoo Temple.  He made a sample and took it to
President Hinckley.  On the original Nauvoo Temple the angel was laying down horizontal, so
he made a sketch of that and then he did a standing one.  President Hinckley said he wanted
Moroni standing up for that marvelous temple back in Nauvoo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now that statue is 6-foot, 8-inches tall and is now on the top of that great temple.  He did another
one like it for the Reno Temple.  I said to him, &#8220;How big is the one on the Salt Lake Temple?&#8221; 
He said, &#8220;It is about 12- to 13-feet high.&#8221;  But he said, &#8220;The largest Moroni in the whole Church
is the one on the Los Angeles Temple; it is over 18-feet tall.&#8221;  Then he told me an interesting
story.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">He said, &#8220;I have a granddaughter.  This granddaughter is a sweet, lovely girl.  She came to me
one day and said, 'Grandpa, if I read all of the scriptures all the way through will you make a
Moroni for me?'&#8221;  And he told me this while we were working in the temple one day and in the
hallway.  He said, &#8220;I told her I would be glad to do that if she would read all of the scriptures.&#8221; 
And I smiled and said, &#8220;I hope she can do it.&#8221;  Then I said, &#8220;Now Karl, if you are going to do
that for her, you know I am always reading the scriptures.  I read them all the time.  What do I
have to do?&#8221;  You know I have a kind face, and he looked at me and he said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll make
one for you.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">So, in a few months, this young girl came to her grandfather and told him that she had read the
scriptures.  Now I would like to invite Julie Quilter to come up to the stand with me.  Julie is
here.  She&#8217;s a senior at this great school.  Where are you Julie?  </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Julie, your grandfather made you a special Moroni, didn't he?  "Yes."  Did you read the
Scriptures?  "Yes.&#8221;  Good for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">This is her sculpture.  I got it from him the other day.  So we brought it up here.  Would you pick
it up?  Are you strong enough?  Isn&#8217;t that wonderful to read the scriptures?  Isn&#8217;t it wonderful to
have a grandfather who can do something like this?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My wife and I have been worried about this since the other day when Julie&#8217;s grandfather put it in
the trunk of my car.  We hope we get it home.  But, Julie, if it gets broke, it is not my fault. 
You&#8217;re the one who put it up here on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I want to talk to you now about Moroni.  Moroni is one of the great men in all of the history of
the world.  What a tremendous thing to think about an individual who lived on this earth and did
what he did and accomplished all he did.  I want to ask you a question, and you ask yourself,
How long has it been since anyone came right up to you and said, "<i>What do you know about
Moroni</i>?"  I don&#8217;t suppose anybody has asked you that very much lately.  
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I have a friend down in Florida in the mission who used to sell automobiles, mainly used cars.  A
man by the name of Dale McCullers came to him one day.  Dale was an All-American football
player and played four years in professional football.  He moved to the little town of Live Oak,
Florida.  He went to my friend Morris Poole and said, &#8220;Mr. Poole, I would like to buy a car off
you, a little truck.&#8221;  And Morris said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you a truck.  It will take me two or three weeks. 
What color?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what color or what kind, just a little old pick-up truck.&#8221;  So
he said to him as he was leaving (Morris Pool, a member of the Church, said to Dale, a
nonmember), &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you your truck, but I have got to ask you a question.  What do you know
about Moroni?&#8221;  And Dale McCullers looked at Morris and said, &#8220;Moroni who?&#8221;  And he said,
&#8220;Oooh, I don&#8217;t think he has a second name.  I have never thought of that my whole life, but
you've got to learn all about Moroni.&#8221;  Dale said, &#8220;If he hasn&#8217;t got a second name, I don&#8217;t want to
hear anything about him.&#8221;  Morris said, &#8220;I am coming to your house tomorrow night because I
have to tell you all about Moroni.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">So he and his wife went over and told him the story, talked to him about the gospel, and three
weeks later Morris delivered the truck and baptized Dale into the Church.  Dale became an
active member of the Church.  Right now, he is serving as a stake president in one of the stakes
just north of Jacksonville, Florida, in the southern part of Georgia.  Just about a month ago now,
Morris died and Dale drove over to Live Oak to be a speaker at his funeral. 
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">That question, 
		<i>What do you know about Moroni</i>, is a magnificent question.  When you are going
out into the mission field or when you just meet people, this is a good question to ask them.  And
then tell them about him.  You know, he is one of the most influential men that the world has
ever known.  He was a prophet, a warrior, a scribe, and many other things.  He was the son of a
great man named Mormon.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Mormon was also a prophet, a leader, and the person who translated much of the 
		<i>Book of
Mormon</i>.  Both Moroni and Mormon wrote that they had been visited by the Savior of the world
and the three Nephites who were still living on the earth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We know that Moroni lived a long time after the Nephites were killed off, by the unrighteous
Laminates.  He lived alone for about 36 or 37 years, all by himself.  He finished writing what he
had to write; then he hid up the plates.  We know nothing about the loneliness of this great soul
except that he did die.  We don&#8217;t know when or how or how old he was.  Some of the Brethren
have felt that he was 80 years of age.  Some say he was over 70.  So he was pretty well up in
years when he passed away.  But, he was a resurrected being who after 1400 years appeared at
the bedside of the Prophet Joseph Smith on the 21st day of September in 1823.  That was three
years after Joseph had the original first vision.  Moroni lived in the fifth century of time.  He was
the last witness of the people who lived in that area of time.  He testified that he had seen the
resurrected Christ.  He is also the most recent person who has lived and died on this earth who
we know has been resurrected.  This great man I&#8217;m talking about, I see him in my mind; a great
soul.  I&#8217;ll bet he was about 6&#8217;3" or 6'4" and had muscles bigger than mine and was really
handsome and wonderful; but you wonder what happened during those years of loneliness. You
wonder how many times he might have been nursed in sickness or in accident or warned of
danger by the three Nephites who did appear to him.  (They had the privilege of living on the
earth and doing whatever they were allowed to do.)  And he testified, &#8220;But behold, my father
[Mormon] and I have seen them, and they have ministered unto us.&#8221;  He tells us that we shall
know that, &#8220;I have seen Jesus."  That you should know, and that is the testimony for each of you. 
This is a man who had seen the Savior.  He bore his testimony, and he said, &#8220;that he talked with
me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility, even as a man telleth another in [his] own
language, concerning these things [that he wanted to tell him].&#8221;  </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now let me tell you a little something, an interesting story, that some of you may not have heard. 
In the early days of the Church, Orson Hyde was called to be one of the original Twelve
Apostles by the Prophet Joseph.  He served under three presidents of the Church&#8211;the Prophet
Joseph, Brigham Young, and John Taylor.  He was one of the great Apostles of this dispensation
of time.  He gave a talk in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on July 4, 1854.  That&#8217;s only seven years
after they came into the valley.  (Now, it&#8217;s not the Tabernacle we know now, but the one they
originally built.)  That talk was a patriotic talk about America.  He called Moroni the &#8220;guardian
angel of America.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;That same angel of God that appeared to Joseph Smith presides
over the destiny of the United States of America.&#8221;  Elder Hyde said that he [Moroni] was in the
camp with George Washington.  He [Moroni] helped George Washington when he had trouble. 
He said that same angel was with Christopher Columbus and gave him deep impressions and
dreams and visions respecting the new world.  He said that same angel was with Columbus on
the stormy deep.  He guided his frail vessel to the desired haven, and he calmed the troubled
elements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Most people never think much about him; but Moroni is still active and busy and doing all those
necessary things to help bring about the full restoration of the gospel.  We honor Moroni.  There
are 14 Latter-day Saint hymns that we sing like, "The Morning Breaks," that&#8217;s about Moroni;
and &#8220;What Was Witnessed in the Heavens?&#8221;; &#8220;An Angel from on High"; &#8220;I Saw a Mighty Angel
Fly&#8221;; and ten others.  These beautiful hymns that we sing in the Church are all because of the
angel Moroni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Moroni had the great privilege, as he walked across this American Continent, of finding a place
and designating the place where the St. George temple was to be built.  He also designated where
the Manti Temple was to be.  And it&#8217;s been written that he designated Kirtland and Nauvoo and
probably others.  Moroni appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith 22 different times during the life
of the Prophet Joseph that we know of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, I want to tell you the names of some of the people that saw Moroni.  We all know he
talked to Joseph Smith who saw him.  We know that Oliver Cowdery saw him as did David
Whitmer and Martin Harris.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Oliver Cowdery was excommunicated from the Church and was out of the Church for ten years,
and then he was rebaptized and brought back into the Church and had a strong testimony of the
great vision, the great experience that he had with the angel Moroni where he had seen those
plates.  Oliver Cowdery incidentally died in the Church.  He was hoping to come across the
country out to the valley, but he got sick and died.  He was only 43 years of age and one of the
greatest men in the history of our Church. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">David Whitmer, one of the witnesses of the 
		<i>Book of Mormon</i>, was also excommunicated. He
lived until he was past 80 years of age.  He never came back into the Church, but he never
denied that he had seen the angel Moroni and had seen the plates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Martin Harris was excommunicated, and was out of harmony with the Church but finally came
out West. He was invited to speak in the Tabernacle. He was re-baptized into the Church and
lived out his life in the northern part of the state of Utah. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, those four men saw him.  But so did Emma Smith, the wife of the Prophet Joseph, and
Mary Whitmer.  Mary Whitmer was the mother of David Whitmer and the four other Whitmers
who were all witnesses of the <i>Book of Mormon</i>. It was in her home that the Brethren organized
the Church; and while they were there holding the meetings of organization, she was doing the
cooking and all the hard work for the men.  She went out into the barn to milk a cow; and while
she was out in that barn, Moroni appeared to her and showed her the plates and gave to her a
testimony that she never forgot.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Moroni appeared to a man by the name of Luke Johnson.  I don&#8217;t know why, but I&#8217;ve always had
a warm feeling toward Luke.  I guess I like the name Johnson.  I guess I like the name Luke. 
Anyway, he saw the angel Moroni.  He handled the plates.  He was one of the original Apostles,
but he was excommunicated from the Church.  However, he saw the error of his ways and came
back and was rebaptized into the Church. Luke came out West with Brigham Young and the
others and went down into the west part of Utah out south of Tooele, Utah.  There he was
ordained a bishop and served as a bishop in the Church. He had been one of the original Apostles
and was a humble wonderful man and one who had seen Moroni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Lucy Harris, the wife of Martin Harris, was a problem.  If my wife wasn&#8217;t here, I&#8217;d say she was a
pain in the rear end as far as the Brethren all went because she was constantly causing trouble to
Joseph Smith.  She wanted to see those plates so bad.  She went out digging out in the field.  And
one day she was digging out there trying to find where the plates had been hidden and a big
snake came up and scared her half to death, and she quit digging.  For some reason I don&#8217;t know,
she had some kind of a dream where Moroni bore his testimony to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The ninth man to see Moroni was a man named Zera Pulsipher.  He was a minister of another
church.  He had a vision in his barn.  While he was out in the barn one day, a light descended
upon him in the middle of this barn, and he looked up and saw Moroni.  And Moroni blessed his
life and showed him the plates.  He became a Seventy in the Church.  He became a high priest
and became a patriarch.  He&#8217;s the man who converted and baptized Wilford Woodruff into the
Church in 1833.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I tell you W. W. Phelps saw Moroni. He was cut off from the Church twice; but he kept coming
back.  He died in full fellowship.  He wrote "Praise to the Man" and some of the other wonderful
hymns that we sing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">John P. Green saw Moroni.  He was a brother-in-law of Brigham Young, and he gave the book to
Brigham Young.  Rhoda Young, his wife, who was the sister of Brigham Young, also had the
privilege of seeing Moroni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">John Taylor, who became one of the Apostles and later the President of the Church, as a young
man had a vision.  Long before he joined the church, he had a vision and he saw an angel of
heaven holding a trumpet in his mouth sending a message out to the nations of the world.  He
didn&#8217;t understand what it was until he joined the Church, and then he understood the great
mission of this man Moroni.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Oliver Granger was met by Moroni.  Moroni actually knelt down and prayed with him and put
his arm on the back of this man so the man could feel him as he talked with him.  
		</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Just before Heber C. Kimball died (Heber C. Kimball was one of the original Apostles who
became a counselor to Brigham Young for many, many years), 21 years after they entered into
the Salt Lake Valley, Heber C. Kimball had a visit from Moroni.  Moroni explained to him that
his work on earth was concluded and that he would soon die.  I think if I remember right, it was
just the night before he passed away.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, I have given you the names of sixteen people who had the privilege of seeing the angel
Moroni.  There&#8217;s one other; I can&#8217;t find the truth on this one, but I am positive in my own mind
that Hyrum Smith, the Prophet's brother, also had a chance to see Moroni.  </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, you&#8217;ve got a chance to see a statue of him on the temples, not all of them, but on most all
of the temples there is an angel Moroni sculpture.  It&#8217;s there to remind us of the 
		<i>Book of
Mormon</i>.  It is there to remind us of what a tremendous thing it is to have lived, and died, and to
have been resurrected.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I hope with all my heart that you wonderful young people will fall in love with the 
		<i>Book of
Mormon</i>, that when you read about these great men in the <i>Book of Mormon</i>, that they will come
off of the pages to you not only as a name but as an individual.  They were all different.  Some
were tall, some were quiet, and some were short.  I don&#8217;t know what they all were; but I have
kind of fallen in love with them.  And some day, if the Lord let&#8217;s me in the next world, I want to
go to conference and hear them preach.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">May God bless you now.  May he bless you to be strong in the faith.  May he bless you to live
the way the <i>Book of Mormon</i> teaches us to live.  May he bless you to be worthy of the prayers of
your mothers and your fathers, especially you girls.  Remember they pray.  They do more than
just worry.  May God bless you all.  And may he bless this great school and all who have to do
with it.  May he be close to us and aid and strengthen you as you journey through life.  God is
good to us.  I hope that you let Him give you every blessing He wants to give you.  And this I do
as I bear testimony to you that the gospel is true, in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ, 
		amen.

<p style="margin-top: -20px">Brothers and sisters, if the Prophet Joseph Smith were to appear to you in a dream, and you could ask him one question, what would you ask?&nbsp; And if he found it important enough to come from the spiritual realms to deliver you a message, what do you think it would be?</p>
<p>Well, President Brigham Young had just such an experience in February of 1847.&nbsp;  In a dream, the Prophet Joseph appeared to President Young.&nbsp; Brigham spoke of his sorrow that he had lost the companionship the two of them had once shared and expressed a desire to come with him.  Joseph said that he must wait a while.&nbsp; Then Brigham asked the Prophet if he had a message for them, &quot;and the Prophet stepped toward him, looking [at him] very earnestly, and said:</p>
<p>Tell the brethren to be humble and faithful and be sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord, that it will lead them aright.&nbsp; Be careful and not turn away the still, small voice; it will teach them what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom.&nbsp; Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction, so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them, their hearts will be ready to receive it</p>
<p>That was the messageÂ—the important thing the Prophet Joseph had come to say.&nbsp; Why would he return in this way to re-emphasize this point?&nbsp;  The brethren had been taught the principle before, and they should have known what they should do without being prompted.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was important enough to be taught again in this dramatic way.&nbsp; 
And, if so, it is doubly important for us to emphasize it here today.</p>
<p>Keep the Spirit of the Lord.&nbsp; Do not turn away the still, small voice.&nbsp; That is good advice, and if you were to analyze it, most, if not all, of the problems in the world today are caused because men and women do not take that advice.&nbsp; What!?&nbsp; You might ask.&nbsp; Can such blame be laid upon the rest of humanity, outside of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who do not so much as know what the Spirit of the Lord is?&nbsp; Nevertheless, I believe you will see that the statement is true if you ponder some of the things described by the sacred term, the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p>Please turn to the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 88, beginning with verse 6.&nbsp; In these verses we learn something of the Light of Christ, sometimes called a &quot;portion&quot; of the LordÂ’s Spirit, given to all mankind.&nbsp; And as we discuss this subject, it is good to keep in mind that the Lord uses several terms as synonyms referring to the same thing.&nbsp; 
&quot;For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and 
whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ&quot; (Doctrine and 
Covenants 84:45).&nbsp; And in another place He says, &quot;The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth&quot; (Doctrine 
and Covenants 93:36).&nbsp; Recognizing that truth, light, spirit, glory, and intelligence may all be synonymous, let us begin by reading from the 88<sup>th</sup> Section.</p>
<p>6 <i>He </i>[that is, Jesus Christ]<i> ascended up on high, as also he 
descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things, that he might be 
in all and through all things, the light of truth</i>;</p>
<p>7 <i>Which truth shineth. This is the light of Christ.  As also he is in the sun, and the light of the sun, and the power thereof by which it was made.</i></p>
<p>8 <i>As also he is in the moon, and is the light of the moon, and the power thereof by which it was made;</i></p>
<p>9 <i>As also the light of the stars, and the power thereof by which they were made</i>;</p>
<p>10 <i>And the earth also, and the power thereof, even the earth upon which you stand</i>.</p>
<p>11 <i>And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings</i>;</p>
<p>12 <i>Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of spaceÂ—</i></p>
<p> 13 <i>The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things</i> (Doctrine 
and Covenants 88:6-13, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Can you see why the Light of Christ is so important?&nbsp;  It is the power of God who created all things.&nbsp; It is the law by which all things are governed.&nbsp; It is the light which gives life to all things.&nbsp; It is the light of the sun by which we see.&nbsp; It is the light that gives us understanding.&nbsp; I believe the Lord refers to it by many different terms, such as truth, light, and intelligence, so that we may have some remote chance of understanding what it is.</p>
<p>Now, we were in the process of laying blame for the ills of the world upon people who do not keep the Spirit of the Lord but who turn away the still, small voice.&nbsp; Of course, no one, who did not know better, can be blamed for anything.&nbsp; Please turn to Doctrine and Covenants, Section 84, beginning with verse 45.</p>
<p>In connection with this subject, Mormon taught that &quot;the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil&quot; (Moroni 7:16).&nbsp;  John wrote that the Light of Christ is &quot;the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world&quot; (John 1:9).&nbsp; Now let us see the harmony of these statements with the scripture you have found in the 84<sup>th</sup> Section.</p>
<p>45 <i>For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ</i>.</p>
<p>46 <i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit</i>.</p>
<p>47 <i>And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 84:45-47).</p>
<p>Now keep your thumb on that page for a moment while we ponder what we have just read.&nbsp; How many people in the world receive the Light of Christ?&nbsp;  If you recognize that the word &quot;man&quot; in this context means &quot;person,&quot; it is easy to see that every person born into the world receives this light.&nbsp; In addition, this light brings two very important gifts with it.&nbsp; First, it gives every personÂ—EVERY personÂ—a knowledge of the difference between good and evil.</p>
<p>Would you like to test it to see if it works?&nbsp; Then imagine this scenario.</p>
<p>Frank is a devoted young husband who, with his wife Jill, is attending classes at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; He is majoring in accounting, while she is only majoring in English, so naturally his life is more stressful.&nbsp;  The only relaxation he gets is to watch an occasional football game on Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; One Saturday, Frank is planted in front of the TV watching the final minutes of his game while Jill is fixing dinner.&nbsp; Jill is having a little stress of her own at this point, but Frank doesnÂ’t notice.&nbsp; The clock is running out, and his teamÂ—down by only one pointÂ—has the ball on the other teamÂ’s ten-yard line.&nbsp; The quarterback drops back to pass.&nbsp; Suddenly a receiver is in the clear.&nbsp; The ball is in the air and--*click*--Jill turns off the television.&nbsp; &quot;I canÂ’t take it any more,&quot; she says.&nbsp; &quot;You need to talk to me.&quot;</p>
<p>What is the right thing for Frank to do?&nbsp; I am not asking what YOU would do in this situation.&nbsp; I am asking what the <u>right</u> thing is.&nbsp; Now, what is the wrong thing for him to do?</p>
<p>Everyone knows!&nbsp;  IsnÂ’t that amazing?&nbsp;  Every soul here knows what is right and wrong in this situation, regardless of how he or she would actually react to such a test.&nbsp; For that reason, we are all left without excuse.  </p>
<p>If you have ever thought that the Lord is unfair because some are born rich while others are poor, and some are born to freedom while others are born into slavery, and some are born whole while others are crippled, you may now revise your thinking.&nbsp; Circumstances make no difference.&nbsp; Everyone, who is mentally competent and can become accountable, begins with an equal knowledge of what is good and what is evil.&nbsp;  Since returning to GodÂ’s presence matters more than any advantage in this world, the Light of Christ levels the playing field.&nbsp; Your choices, and not your circumstances, make the difference.&nbsp; All a person has to do is hearken to the voice of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Paul the apostle was born into favorable circumstances and became an influential Pharisee; yet, when the Spirit struck him hard enough, he hearkened to the voice.&nbsp; Joseph Smith was born poor in a society of religious turmoil and confusion, yet he hearkened to the voice of the Spirit rather than to the false preachers of his day.&nbsp; As a result, he was visited by God.&nbsp; Laman and Lemuel were born into favorable circumstances and were taught the gospel from their infancy.&nbsp; Nonetheless, even though they saw an angel and witnessed mighty miracles, they did not hearken to the voice of the Spirit, and fell into darkness and apostasy.&nbsp; Joseph, the son of Jacob, spent years in the Egyptian prison.&nbsp; Others in his circumstances may have given in to anger and resentment, but Joseph hearkened to the voice of the Spirit and was delivered in a miraculous way.  </p>
<p>As the gospel is being preached by the missionaries today, people are coming into the Church, &quot;one of a city, and two of a family&quot; (Jeremiah 3:14), rising out of circumstances that keep the majority of the human race subject to the devil.&nbsp; How do they escape the snares of the adversary?&nbsp; By hearkening to the voice of the Spirit.&nbsp; Refer to verse 46 again.&nbsp; The Spirit enlightens the person who hearkens, making it easier and more desirable for him to understand spiritual things.&nbsp; And verse 47.&nbsp; Whosoever hearkens comes unto God.&nbsp; Now if Alice comes unto God, God will come unto her, and she will eventually have the opportunity to partake of the gospel in its fullness.  As the large rocks in a shaken bucket of gravel work their way to the top, so people who hearken to the light of Christ may work their way into the celestial kingdom.</p>
<p>It is clear that the Light of Christ gives every person a knowledge of good and evil.&nbsp;  I believe the second thing it gives is a conviction, deep in the heart, that there is a God.&nbsp; 
How can one know good without knowing the source of good?&nbsp;  How can the person who hearkens come unto God without having some intimation that there is a God?&nbsp;  How can knowledge of God be obtained by any other means than by the Spirit?</p>
<p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie said:</p>
<p>There is no other foundation upon which the Lord could build his Church and kingdom.  The things of God are known only by the power of his Spirit.  God stands revealed or he remains forever unknown.  No man can know that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost</p>
<p>If you still have your thumb in Section 84, you will see that the Lord himself gives the reason for the worldÂ’s problems and lays the blame in verses 49 and 50.</p>
<p>49 <i>And the whole world lieth in sin, and groaneth under darkness and under the bondage of sin</i>.</p>
<p>50 <i>And by this you may know they are under the bondage of sin, because they come not unto me</i> (Doctrine 
and Covenants 84:49-50).</p>
<p>Atheists say they do not believe in God.&nbsp; Frankly, I do not believe in atheists.&nbsp; Let me remind you of the classic atheistÂ—a man by the name of Korihor.&nbsp; You may find him in the 30<sup>th</sup> chapter of Alma.&nbsp; Korihor went about preaching that there is no God, there would be no Christ, and that &quot;whatsoever a man did was no crime&quot; (Alma 30:17).&nbsp; He apparently had success among some of the Nephites, but the people of Ammon cast him out of the land of Jershon, and the people of Gideon got tired of listening to him, so they bound him and took him to the authorities.&nbsp; Eventually, he was taken to Zarahemla to appear before Alma and the chief judge.&nbsp; You will recall that there was a long discussion between Alma and Korihor in which Korihor asked three times for Alma to give him a sign that God exists.&nbsp; After the third request, Alma obliged by saying, &quot;This will I give unto thee for a sign, that thou shalt be struck dumb. . .that ye shall no more have utterance&quot; (Alma 30:49).&nbsp; Immediately, Korihor lost his voice and apparently his hearing, since the chief judge had to write a question for him.</p>
<p>Now, let us read verses 52 and 53.</p>
<p>52 <i>And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it were the power of God could bring this upon me; yea, and I always knew that there was a God</i>.</p>
<p>53 <i>But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I taught them because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great curse upon me</i> (Alma 30:52-53).</p>
<p>You see, Korihor always knew there was a God, but he hearkened to the teachings of the devil rather than to the Light of Christ because the teachings of the devil are pleasing to the carnal mind.  </p>
<p>Let me make a similar point by sharing with you the words of a modern atheist.&nbsp; These are the first two paragraphs of an article called &quot;Man Against Darkness&quot; by W. T. Stace.&nbsp; They are quite instructive.&nbsp; Remember that I am now quoting from Stace:</p>
<p>&#9;<i>The Catholic bishops of America recently issued a statement in which they said that the chaotic and bewildered state of the modern world is due to manÂ’s loss of faith, his abandonment of God and religion.  For my part I believe in no religion at all.  Yet I entirely agree with the bishops.  It is no doubt an oversimplification to speak of the cause of so complex a state of affairs as the tortured condition of the world today.  Its causes are doubtless multitudinous.  Yet allowing for some element of oversimplification, I say that the bishopsÂ’ assertion is substantially true</i>.</p>
<p>&#9;Stace goes on to say:</p>
<p>&#9;<i>M. Jean-Paul Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher, labels himself an atheist.  Yet his views seem to me plainly to support the statement of the bishops.  So long as there was believed to be a God in the sky, he says, men could regard him as the source of their moral ideals.  The universe, created and governed by a fatherly God, was a friendly habitation for man.  We could be sure that, however great the evil in the world, good in the end would triumph and the forces of evil would be routed.  With the disappearance of God from the sky all this has changed.  Since the world is not ruled by a spiritual being, but rather by blind forces, there cannot be any ideals, moral or otherwise, in the universe outside us.  Our ideals, therefore, must proceed only from our own minds, they are our own inventions.  Thus the world which surrounds us is nothing but an immense spiritual emptiness.  It is a dead universe.  We do not live in a universe which is on the side of our values.  It is completely indifferent to them</i> (DeNitto and Leary 175).</p>
<p>If you listened carefully, you will note that Stace argues there are no such things as God or good or evil.&nbsp; He says these concepts are invented by manÂ—that they come from our own minds.&nbsp;  The interesting irony is that WHAT he says is directly contradicted by HOW he says it.</p>
<p>In the first place, he makes a moral judgment based on absolutes of good and evil, expecting that the audience will understand and agree with his evaluation.&nbsp;  The world, he implies, was not tortured, chaotic, and bewildered at some time in the past.&nbsp;  Obviously, that was good.&nbsp;  Then he says that the world today is chaotic, bewildered, and tortured, which no one could take as anything but bad.&nbsp; His judgment of better and worse implies the existence of a good and evil not created by the mind of man.&nbsp; You may have seen other interesting implications in this statement as well, but this is the one I wish to emphasize.&nbsp; While Stace adamantly declares that good and evil do not exist except in the mind of individuals (which means there would be as many definitions of good and evil as there are people), he cannot help using universal meanings of good and evil that have nothing to do with individual preferences or prejudices.&nbsp; This is good evidence that, even though he would deny it, the Light of Christ is still operative in his life.</p>
<p>The person whose soul longs for light will find that light within and will follow it.&nbsp; Then something wonderful happens.&nbsp; To read about it, turn to Doctrine and Covenants, Section 50, verse 24.&nbsp; It tells us of a growth and refinement process brought about by light.&nbsp;  We could make a comparison here.&nbsp; Imagine you have been wearing warm clothing with long sleeves all winter.&nbsp; Your arms have not been exposed to sunlight, and you know what happens.&nbsp; They become lighter and more sensitive to the sunÂ’s rays.&nbsp; Then, on the first sunny day of spring, you rush outside with short sleeves and drive to the lake to go boating.&nbsp; After a few hours, you realize, painfully, that you have a severe sunburn.&nbsp; Too much light, too quickly, if you are not prepared, can be harmful to your health.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you were to expose your sensitive skin to a little sunlight, just a few moments a day, soon you would be able to endure longer sessions, and eventually be able to go boating without getting a sunburn at all.&nbsp; Remember that physical and spiritual light come from the same source and have similar effects.&nbsp;  For instance, if we, in our corrupt state, were suddenly to be exposed to the full glory of God, we would be consumed.&nbsp; We are told that &quot;the presence of the Lord shall be as the melting fire that burneth, and as the fire which causeth the waters to boil&quot; (Doctrine 
and Covenants 133:41).&nbsp; But there is a plan to &quot;condition&quot; us, if I may use that word, to spiritual things, so that we may stand in the LordÂ’s presence.&nbsp; Let us now read Section 50, verse 24.</p>
<p>24 <i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day</i> (Doctrine 
and Covenants 50:24).</p>
<p>There is little chance of &quot;spiritual sunburn&quot; if we receive the light incrementally, in small amounts, through obedience, first to one principle, and then to a greater principle.&nbsp; The light within us grows brighter each time we obey until we become perfect, like our Heavenly Father.  </p>
<p>Now please turn to Doctrine and Covenants, Section 88, verses 66 and 67.&nbsp; These verses explain the same concept in a different way, helping us to see what we must do to grow in light and in truth, and what the ultimate end will be.</p>
<p>67 <i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things</i>.</p>
<p>68 <i>Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will </i>(Doctrine 
and Covenants 88:67-68).</p>
<p>As you can see, a great blessing awaits those who sanctify themselves so that their eyes (or, in other words, their minds) become single to God.&nbsp; While the Light of Christ gives everyone in the world a knowledge of good and evil, and while a person may hearken to that Spirit, something else is needed for the individual to become sanctified.&nbsp; Please turn to 3 Nephi 27:20.</p>
<p>As the Nephite disciples of Jesus were journeying about preaching the gospel, they met together and joined in mighty prayer and fasting.&nbsp; While they were so engaged, the Lord appeared to them and taught them some important principles.&nbsp; Let us read what Jesus said in verse 20:</p>
<p>20 <i>Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day </i>(3 Nephi 27:20).</p>
<p>There is a chain of causes and effects here.&nbsp; We have learned that, to come into the presence of the Savior and to comprehend all things, a personÂ’s whole body must be filled with light.&nbsp; In order to be filled with light, the person must first have a mind single to the glory of God, or, in other words, desire to do the will of the Lord to the exclusion of all other considerations.&nbsp; Before the person can have an eye single to the glory of God, he or she must become sanctified.&nbsp; And we have just learned, from verse 20, that the individual is sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>If you have been baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, shortly after your baptism, hands were laid upon your head, and you were given the Gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Reflect upon that ordinance, and you will recall these words being said to you: &quot;Receive the Holy Ghost.&quot;</p>
<p>That does not sound like in invitation or a suggestion, does it?&nbsp; It is not.&nbsp; It is an imperative sentence expressing a command.&nbsp; By the ordinance, a person is confirmed a member of the Church, but the responsibility for receiving the Holy Ghost rests entirely upon the individual.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost will force Himself upon no one.&nbsp; If a person is commanded to receive the Holy Ghost, and then refuses or neglects to do it, there are consequences.</p>
<p>Perhaps the word &quot;receive&quot; needs an illustration.&nbsp; Jay and Carlos are friends.&nbsp; Jay tells Carlos he would like to ask Sandra for a date.&nbsp; Carlos suggests that he go to SandraÂ’s house and ask her.&nbsp; Jay takes the advice and knocks on SandraÂ’s door.&nbsp; Sandra answers the door, sees who it is, says: &quot;Not you again!,&quot; and slams the door.  Jay goes back to Carlos and says, &quot;I took your advice and knocked on SandraÂ’s door.&quot;&nbsp; Carlos asks, &quot;How were you received?&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps that helps to define the word.&nbsp; Some people receive the Holy Ghost in the same way.&nbsp; Reception of the Holy Ghost begins with the realization that the Spirit desires to come into your life to sanctify you.&nbsp; Then it requires some effort and desire on your part, to open the door, so to speak, and let Him in.&nbsp; A person receives the Spirit by the prayer of faith (Doctrine  
and Covenants 42:14, 63:64), so there must also be a personal invitation, a fervent desire on your part for the companionship of the Spirit, and diligent effort to be worthy.&nbsp; He will not enter if your house is not swept clean.</p>
<p>If you receive the Holy Ghost as your constant companion, walk with Him daily, and allow Him to sanctify you, He will begin to enlighten your mind and to fill your soul with light.&nbsp; He will show you all things that you should do (see 2 Nephi 32:5).&nbsp; But remember that the Spirit is very sensitive.&nbsp; Do not do anything to offend Him, or He will leave you, because the Holy Ghost does not dwell in unholy temples.</p>
<p>Our desire is to become filled with light, as Heavenly Father is, so that we may dwell in His presence.&nbsp; To prepare us for that, we have the privilege of receiving a member of the Godhead into our lives while we yet dwell in mortality.&nbsp; Think of the great blessing it is to have the influence of that Holy Being at all times if we keep ourselves worthy.</p>
<p>The result of receiving the Holy GhostÂ—that is, of consciously, willingly, and gladly receiving the Holy GhostÂ—is that it has marvelous effects upon the body and the mind.&nbsp;  Parley P. Pratt explains some of those effects in the following quotation:</p>
<p>An intelligent being, in the image of God, possesses every organ, attribute, sense, sympathy, affection, of will, wisdom, love, power, and gift, which is possessed by God himself.</p>
<p>But these are possessed by man, in his rudimental state, in a subordinate sense of the word.  Or, in other words, these attributes are in embryo; and are to be gradually developed.  They resemble a budÂ—a germ, which gradually develops into bloom, and then, by progress, produces the mature fruit, after its own kind.</p>
<p>The gift of the Holy Spirit adapts itself to all these organs or attributes.  It quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands, and purifies all the natural passions and affections; and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use.  It inspires, develops, cultivates, and matures all the fine-toned sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings, and affections of our nature.  It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness, and charity.  It develops beauty of person, form, and features.  It tends to health, vigor, animation, and social feeling.  It develops and invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man.  It strengthens, invigorates, and gives tone to the nerves.  In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being</p>
<p>If any of us have not experienced some of these things, perhaps we should become more aware and make more of an effort to receive the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; We must be cautious, however, that we recognize the Spirit of the Lord and are sure it is the Spirit we have.&nbsp; The devil can appear as an angel of light and can counterfeit a spiritual experience.  </p>
<p>The person who talks excessively about spiritual manifestations is likely to be under the wrong influence.&nbsp; Such things are sacred and must be spoken of only by constraint of the Spirit (see Doctrine 
and Covenants 63:64).  The person who tries to exercise compulsion upon those who disagree, or who becomes angry when others do not accept what he adamantly advances as correct principles, has the spirit of contention, and that spirit is not of God.&nbsp; The person who insists that a spiritual experience can be gained through carnal, sensual art or entertainment has been deceived by the adversary.</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith said, &quot;Nothing is a greater injury to the children of men than to be under the influence of a false spirit when they think they have the Spirit of God&quot; (<u>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</u>, 205).</p>
<p>When the Prophet Joseph appeared to Brigham Young and directed him to tell the brethren to keep the Spirit of the Lord, he also gave this bit of advice:</p>
<p>They can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits; it will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take malice, hatred, strife and all evil from their hearts, and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness, and build up the kingdom of God </p>
<p>Mormon taught the same doctrine in Moroni, Chapter 7, verses 13-16.&nbsp; Let us read his words together.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>13 <i>But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God</i>.</p>
<p>14 <i>Wherefore, take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the devil</i>.</p>
<p>15 <i>For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night</i>.</p>
<p>16 <i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God </i>(Moroni 7:13-16).</p>
<p>It is my hope that we can all live by the light of the Holy Spirit, though we may, at times, as Nephi, be led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things we should do (see 1 Nephi 4:6).  The Spirit of God will always lead us right.  I bear testimony that this is true in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
amen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>MOTHERS<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span> WEEKEND WELCOME</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>Brigham Young
University-Idaho </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>March 21, 2003</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>President David A.
Bednar</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, welcome.Â  We are delighted that you
are here.Â  I especially love this occasion each year on our campus because
young men, who think they are so big and so tough, sit with their moms and put
their heads on her shoulder during an event like this.Â  Though you think you
are big and tough, you are just a little boy when you are with your mom.Â  And
to observe daughters with their mothers having fun together is truly
delightful.Â  It is a joy to watch those interactions, and we appreciate the opportunity
to meet you.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I invite all of you to now help create a very large
classroom.Â  If you have your scriptures with you, please get them out.Â  While
you are opening your scriptures, you also might want to find a scrap of paper
and a pen or a pencil<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>certainly
not to jot down anything I will say, but to write down the impressions that
will come to your mind and to your heart as they are placed there by the Holy
Ghost.Â  Please help me and everyone in attendance by inviting the Holy Ghost to
be here as we learn together.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before I specifically address the theme of <i>No Ordinary
Cause</i>, I would like to make an observation related to the troubling times
in which we live.Â  To do so, I want to use a statement by Brigham Young:Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>It was revealed to me in
the commencement of the Church, that the Church would spread, prosper, grow,
and extend, and that in proportion to the spread of the gospel among the
nations of the world so would the power of Satan rise<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> (<u>Discourses of Brigham Young</u>, p. 72).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The very clouds of darkness we see in the world and the
increase in evil are powerful witnesses of the spreading, the growing, and the
prospering of the kingdom of God in all the world.Â  Juxtapositioned against the
dark is the light.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>The
morning breaks, the shadows flee; Lo, Zion<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
standard is unfurled!<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
(<u>Hymns</u>, No. 1).Â  So, indeed, these are troubling and perplexing times.Â 
But the disciples of the Savior will <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>stand
in holy places, and [will] not be moved (D&amp;C&nbsp;45:32).Â  I hope we will
always remember that gospel perspective as we watch events unfold around the
world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Last Saturday Sister Bednar and I were in Salt Lake City to
attend a President<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
Club Banquet.Â  Friends of BYU-Idaho who financially and in other ways support the
university are invited to attend this activity.Â  The banquet is held at the top
of the Church Office Building, and we were blessed to have President and Sister
Hinckley attend with us this year.Â  I want to share several things that we
talked about with President and Sister Hinckley.Â  I want to begin with Sister
Hinckley.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the dinner began, Sister Bednar helped Sister Hinckley
get her plate of food.Â  Then, as we were seated at the table, I asked President
Hinckley, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Based on
your travels throughout the world, if you could have any dessert from any place
in the world, what would you have?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
I had not even finished saying the word <i>have</i> when Sister Hinckley said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Me!<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What I am about to describe is one of the sweetest and most
tender things I have ever seen in my relationship with Sister Bednar<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>and, as of yesterday, we
have been married for 28&nbsp;years.Â  Following the banquet, we went to the
tabernacle to watch an oratorio performed by the BYU-Idaho orchestra and
choirs.Â  We climbed into a golf cart near the Church Office Building and drove
through the tunnels to the tabernacle.Â  As you arrive in the basement of the
tabernacle, there is a very small elevator that takes you up to the main
floor.Â  Barely three or four people can squeeze into that elevator at one
time.Â  President and Sister Hinckley walked into the elevator; then President
Hinckley said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Come
on, David and Susan.Â  Come with us.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
So the four of us squeezed into the elevator; we were very, very close to each
other.Â  Susan was next to Sister Hinckley, and I was next to President
Hinckley.Â  Sister Hinckley reached over, took both of Susan<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s hands, and said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I really like you a lot.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  Susan responded and said,
<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Well Sister Hinckley,
I like you a lot back.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
It was such a tender thing to see the prophet<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
wife and my wife reciprocate such love for one another.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The reason I share that episode is because I think it is
expressive of what so many of you feel about Sister Bednar.Â  She has an uncanny
ability to connect with sisters<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>to
share episodes and simple, ordinary things that warm and touch the hearts of
sisters.Â  We are delighted to be able to reverence womanhood and pay tribute
especially to mothers on this weekend.Â  I pay particular tribute to my wife.Â  I
really like her a lot too.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Back to my story.Â  During the course of the evening, I
turned to President Hinckley and said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>President
Hinckley, this coming week we will be celebrating Mothers<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span> Weekend at BYU&#8209;Idaho.Â 
Sister Bednar and I will be speaking.Â  We are focusing on a theme from an
address you gave in the late 1980s.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
I indicated the theme was <i>No Ordinary Cause</i> and said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>President Hinckley, is
there a particular message you would have me deliver to those who will be in
attendance?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  He did
not hesitate.Â  He said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Yes.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  This was his message:Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Tell them to love the
gospel, to love one another, and to have respect for their parents<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>and for their mothers in
particular.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sister Bednar has already indicated the context of this year<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s theme.Â  I want to repeat
it.Â  This is the teaching from President Hinckley in 1989:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">I need not remind you that this cause
in which we are engaged is not an ordinary cause.Â  It is the cause of Christ.Â 
It is the kingdom of God our Eternal Father.Â  It is the building of Zion on the
earth, the fulfillment of prophesy given of old and of the vision revealed in
this dispensation.Â  (<i>An Ensign to the Nations</i>, October 1989)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I have reflected on the statement <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>no ordinary cause,<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> I have considered both the word <i>ordinary</i>
and the word <i>cause</i>.Â Â  The word <i>ordinary</i> suggests average, common,
customary, plain, standard, or usual.Â  The word <i>cause </i>relates to a
reason, a motive, a belief, a purpose, mission, or undertaking.Â  Thus the cause
of Christ and the building of His kingdom on the earth in this day are not
average undertakings.Â  The cause of Christ is not common.Â  It is not a
customary belief, purpose, or undertaking.Â  Why?Â  Why is this not an ordinary
cause?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, because the author and sponsor of this cause is the
Savior of the world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Second, because the scope and the reach of this cause and
this undertaking are expansive and extensive.Â  I do not want to go through a
long laundry list, but please consider that the gospel is established in more
than 140 nations around the earth.Â  Consider the sheer logistics of moving
30,000 missionaries every year.Â  How would you like to be in charge of
arranging airline tickets for missionaries going to the field and the
missionaries returning home?Â  Think of the reach and the scope of communication
capabilities in the kingdom of God<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>television,
radio, Internet, satellite.Â  If you consider the magnitude, the reach, and the
scope of what takes place in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
truly, this is no ordinary cause.Â  It is not paralleled by any other
organization on the earth.Â  Most importantly, it is not an ordinary cause
because of its importance in and to the world and the impact it has in the
lives of individuals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I want to refer to an exchange the Prophet Joseph Smith had
with President Martin Van&nbsp;Buren.Â  The Prophet Joseph went to Washington
seeking redress for the wrongs perpetrated against the members of the Church.Â 
When asked by President Van&nbsp;Buren how Mormonism differed from other
religions of the day, the Prophet Joseph is reported to have said the
following:Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A&gt;</span>We [differ] in mode of
baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>Â  All other considerations,
the Prophet said, are <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>&gt;</span>contained
in the gift of the Holy Ghost<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=@</span> (<u>History of the Church</u>,
4:42).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â The Prophet<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
statement suggests that the distinctive characteristic of the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s people, and this would be
so in all generations of time, has been the companionship of the Holy Ghost and
the attendant manifestations of the gifts of the Spirit.Â  In large measure, it
is the testifying power, the confirming witness, and the spiritual gifts
associated with the Holy Ghost that make this no ordinary cause.Â  Let me repeat
those three elements:Â  the testifying power, the confirming witness, and the
spiritual gifts associated with the Holy Ghost.Â  Brigham Young said the
following:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Our faith is concentrated in the Son of
God, and through him in the Father; and the Holy Ghost is their minister to
bring truths to our remembrance, to reveal new truths to us, and teach, guide,
and direct the course of every mind until we become perfected and prepared to
go home, where we can see and converse with our Father in Heaven.Â  (Brigham
Young, November 29, 1857, <u>Journal of Discourses</u>, 6:98)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I invite you to turn with me to 2 Nephi 26:12-13.Â  This
scripture highlights the central role of the Holy Ghost and the testifying
power and the confirming witness that can come only from the Holy Ghost.Â  Have
you ever been reading the scriptures only to find new things have been inserted
since you read them the last time?Â  Well, as I read these verses recently, I
found a phrase that I have never before seen.Â  Beginning with verse 12:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And as I spake concerning the
convincing of the Jews, that Jesus is the very Christ, it must needs be that
the Gentiles be convinced also that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And that he manifesteth himself unto
all those who believe in him, <b>by the power of the Holy Ghost</b>; yea, unto
every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and
wonders, among the children of men according to their faith.Â  (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Central in that responsibility of convincing both Jew and
Gentile that Jesus is the Christ<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>those
of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>is
the testifying power and the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please turn with me in the Book of Mormon to Mormon 9:7-9.Â 
Again, I keep coming back to the theme <i>No Ordinary Cause.Â  </i>Why is this
no ordinary cause?Â  One of the primary answers to that question is the Holy
Ghost<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>the testifying
power, the confirming witness, the spiritual gifts associated with the Holy
Ghost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And again I speak unto you who deny the
revelations of God, and say that they are done away, that there are no
revelations, nor prophecies, nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with tongues,
and the interpretation of tongues;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Behold I say unto you, he that denieth
these things knoweth not the gospel of Christ; yea, he has not read the
scriptures; if so, he does not understand them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">For do we not read that God is the same
yesterday, today, and forever, and in him there is no variableness neither
shadow of changing?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, what is it that makes this no ordinary cause?Â  Many
things.Â  But one of the primary reasons is the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the
Spirit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to suggest a perspective and perhaps teach a
principle.Â  I want to draw our attention to the sacrament prayers.Â  Please turn
with me in your Doctrine and Covenants to section 20.Â  We will begin reading in
verse 77:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee
in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the
souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the
body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they
are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, . . .</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is important to note that we do not covenant to take
upon us the name of Christ; rather, we covenant that we are willing to take
upon us the name of Christ.Â  This statement has many important implications<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>one of which is that we
commit and covenant to go to the house of the Lord and, through receiving the
ordinances of the temple, continue the process of taking upon ourselves the
name of Christ.Â  Elder Dallin Oaks has indicated that a willingness to take
upon ourselves the name of Christ means that in His name and by His authority
we do His work.Â  So that is one of the key elements of the covenant into which
we enter at the time of baptism.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another key element of the covenant is that of remembering:Â 
<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>. . . always remember
him&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . .<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
And finally, we pledge to <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>.
. . keep his commandments which he has given . . . .<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thus, in this sacred covenant, we pledge that we will
(1)&nbsp;walk and work in His name by property authority, (2)&nbsp;remember
Him, and (3)&nbsp;obey His commandments.Â  As we do those three things, then
comes this promise:Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>.
. . that they may <b>always</b> have his Spirit to be with them<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So we highlight four key elements:Â  work, remember, obey,
and the promise that if we are diligent in pursuing those three objectives,
then we may always have his Spirit to be with us.Â  Now, let us compare that to
the blessing on the water.Â  This is verse 79:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee
in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this water to the
souls of all those who drink of it, that they may do it in remembrance of the
blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they may witness unto thee, O
God, the Eternal Father, that they do always remember him, that they may have
his Spirit to be with them.Â  Amen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â The prayer on the water highlights remembering, and there
is no promise of always having His spirit to be with us.Â  Remembering is
important, but it is not enough.Â  If we would qualify for the constant
companionship of the Holy Ghost, which makes this no ordinary cause, then it
requires work and remembering and obeying.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here is the perspective, the principle, I want you to think
about:Â  Given the promise that we can always have his Spirit to be with us, why
do we only talk about recognizing and responding to the Holy Ghost when it
prompts us?Â  Obviously, we are not perfect; obviously, the Spirit will come and
go.Â  But the Spirit ought to be with us more than it is absent.Â  But do we not
typically, in our Sunday School and Relief Society and priesthood classes and
seminary, always talk about recognizing the Holy Ghost when it comes?Â  I think
we have the perspective backwards.Â  The question should be:Â  What are the
events, the circumstances, the conditions when we recognize the Spirit
leaving?Â  It should not be the case that we <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>gear
up<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> and become
spiritually supercharged in order to recognize the Holy Ghost on the <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>rare<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> occasions when it comes.Â  If we are working,
if we are remembering, if we are obeying, then the Spirit ought to be with us
more than it would not be with us.Â  So my question is, why do we primarily
focus on when it comes instead of when it leaves?Â  If we take the perspective
of recognizing the Spirit when it leaves and not just when it comes, then we
have, in literal fact, a Liahona to guide our day-to-day lives.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please listen to the characteristics of the Liahona as
described in Alma 37:38-40:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And now, my son, I have somewhat to say
concerning the thing which our fathers call a ball, or director<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>or our fathers called it
Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And behold, there cannot any man work
after the manner of so curious a workmanship.Â  And behold, it was prepared to
show unto our fathers the course which they should travel in the wilderness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And it did work for them according to
their faith in God; therefore, if they had faith to believe that God could
cause that those spindles should point the way they should go, behold, it was
done; therefore they had this miracle, and also many other miracles wrought by
the power of God, day by day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What would our lives be like, brothers and sisters, if we
saw something, if we read something, if we heard something, and we felt the
Holy Ghost depart and then we just quit doing whatever it was that caused the
Spirit to withdraw?Â  What if we did not look at it, did not listen to it?Â  The
Holy Ghost would come back.Â  What does it say about us if we go to a form of
entertainment where there is inappropriate language or things that we should
not see and the Holy Ghost leaves, and you and I say, <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Oh, it was not that bad of movie<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>just a few swear words.Â  It
was not that bad.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
Well, the Holy Ghost thought it was pretty bad and left!Â  And you and I ought
to have a Liahona that would say, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I
know when the Holy Ghost left.Â  I did not like that, so I ought to quit doing
whatever it was that caused the Holy Ghost to leave.<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That is what makes this no ordinary cause.Â  I hope we do not
treat this supernal gift as just an ordinary gift. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Alma 37:41-42 we read:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Nevertheless, because those miracles
were worked by small means it did show unto them marvelous works.Â  They were
slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those
marvelous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Â Therefore, they tarried in the
wilderness, or did not travel a direct course, and were afflicted with hunger
and thirst, because of their transgressions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, I would simply suggest that we ought
to focus at least as much on the Holy Ghost leaving as we do on recognizing
when it comes.Â  That helps us in the process of working and remembering and
obeying such that we may always have His Spirit to be with us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, just a couple of considerations.Â  First, the Holy Ghost
has a distinctive pattern by which he works; it is called <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>line upon line, precept
upon precept<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> (2 Nephi
28:30).Â  Rarely does the Holy Ghost provide answers all at once.Â  Answers
generally come in small packets over an extended period of time.Â  Sister Bednar
and I meet with 150 to 200 students almost every Monday night for home
evening.Â  The question we are asked most frequently is, <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>How can we recognize the difference between
the Holy Ghost telling me what I<i> need </i>to know and me telling me what I <i>want</i>
to know?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  There is a
fundamental obstacle that we often put in our own way in trying to understand
the answer to that question.Â  And that obstacle is the expectation that we get
one big answer all at once.Â  But throughout the scriptures, throughout the
Restoration, we see evidence of how help from heaven comes <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>line upon line, precept
upon precept, here a little and there a little<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
(2 Nephi 28:30).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For the last three years we have been trying to create
Brigham Young University-Idaho.Â  President Hinckley announced the change and
then said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>President
Bednar, you and your team get to work.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
There was no overarching plan.Â  The transition was not strategically designed
before the announcement was made.Â  Prophets announce, then you get to do it.Â 
The transition has come <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>line
upon line, precept upon precept.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
And everyone on this campus who has been involved in the transition, as we step
back and look at what has come over time in this incremental way, finds it to
be a thing of awe and wonder.Â  It did not come all at once.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If our expectation is that we offer a prayer and will have
an answer before we get up from our knees, we likely will be disappointed.Â 
Answers come <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>line
upon line, precept upon precept<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
as we move in a direction that is in accordance with gospel principles and with
what we feel is right.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Consideration number two:Â  There is a very important
relationship between keeping confidences and receiving revelation from the Holy
Ghost.Â  Brigham Young taught the following:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Should you receive a vision of
revelation from the Almighty, one that the Lord gave you concerning yourselves
or this people, but which you are not to reveal on account of you not being the
proper person or because you ought not to be known by the people at present,
you should shut it up and seal it as closed and lock it as tight as heaven is
to you and make it as secret as the grave.Â  <b>The Lord has no confidence in
those who reveal secrets for he cannot safely reveal Himself to such persons.</b>Â

<p class="MsoNormal">I have heard the Brethren indicate that we would have more

<p class="MsoNormal">I would simply recommend, brothers and sisters, that we
consider the guideline taught by both Brigham Young and President Packer as it

bishop or to the Relief Society president.Â  Obviously, such gifts are available
to the Apostles.Â  But those gifts do not apply to me.<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  I would simply suggest that no office or
formal position is a prerequisite to the gifts of the Spirit.Â  The most
ordinary, simple, common member of the Church, without visible or highly
responsible position, can and should enjoy the gift of discernment, the gift of
judgement, the gift of wisdom, the gift of knowledge.Â  I have frequently said
to the students on this campus, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Why
do we think that the gift of tongues only operates after you receive a mission
call and you must learn to speak Spanish, or Finnish, or German?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  Would the gift of tongues
not operate for a freshman student taking an introductory Spanish class?Â 
Absolutely.Â  And would such a young man or young woman then not be better
prepared to enter the Missionary Training Center having already experienced the
gift of tongues while struggling as a freshman student?Â  Absolutely.Â  The gifts
of the Spirit are available to all of us.</p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">It requires the utmost care upon the
part of the people who have received the Spirit of the Lord by the laying on of
hands to distinguish between the voice of that Spirit and the voice of their
own hearts or other spirits which may take possession of them.Â  Experience and
watchfulness will enable the Saint to recognize the voice of the Holy Spirit.Â 
It is a still, small voice in the hearts of the children of men.Â  It is not
boisterous, loud or aggressive, and if those who receive it carefully watch its
suggestions it will develop more and more within them, and it will become an
unfailing source of revelation.Â  But the necessity always remains of exercising
care in distinguishing its voice from the voice of other influences in the
heart.Â  (<u>Gospel Truth</u>, 1:182)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, the Holy Ghost is available to all of
us.Â  Its influence is not typically overwhelming; it is not dramatic.Â  I
visited briefly yesterday with one of the employees in the Executive Office

you?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  The answer was,
<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I didn<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t know. Â I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>m just over here on
business.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  Many would
say such an event was a coincidence.Â  It was not a coincidence.Â  I can think of
instances when I have been seated in my office and I just had a feeling that I
needed to be out and about.Â  So I walked across campus and ended up saying
hello to a faculty member who asked, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Did
you get my message that I needed to visit with you?<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  And I answered, <span style='font-family:

you.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  How do you
happen to get to the right place at the right time for somebody who needs you
and you had no idea the need existed?Â  Certainly, this is no ordinary cause.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One final episode, and then I will conclude.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just a few weeks ago on a Friday night as I was preparing
for a stake conference assignment, I felt unsettled.Â  I could not explain it; I
could not define it.Â  I just did not feel settled.Â  I said to Susan, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I am going to drive to Salt
Lake City tomorrow to catch my flight instead of departing from Idaho Falls.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  It made no sense to do
this.Â  We watched the news and learned there was a forecast for thick fog
Saturday morning.Â  So I said to Sue, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I
guess the fog is going to be a problem.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
The next morning as I was driving through Idaho Falls on my way to Salt Lake
City at 6 o<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>clock,
there was no fog.Â  I thought to myself, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Maybe
I should go home and catch my 9:30 flight as I had planned<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>because there is no fog.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  But I just kept driving.Â 
I arrived at the Salt Lake City airport and went through all of the hassle
incident to having not taken the initial flight on my itinerary.Â  Everything
was resolved, and I went to board my flight.Â  As I was walking to the gate, I
looked at the screens with the information about the departing and arriving
flights.Â  The flight that was scheduled to depart Idaho Falls at 9:30 (on which
I had originally been scheduled) would not arrive until 11:10 a.m.Â  My flight
out of Salt Lake City was scheduled to leave at 11:10 a.m.Â  If I had gone back
home earlier that morning and taken the 9:30&nbsp;flight, I never would have
made it to my stake conference assignment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is no ordinary cause.Â  That episode says absolutely
nothing about Dave Bednar; it says everything about this cause.Â  When we are on
the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s errand, we
will get where we need to be.Â  You might think, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Of
course, those things happen to somebody with the responsibility of a Seventy.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  But they happen to all of
us every day<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>if we
have eyes to see and ears to hear.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, this is no ordinary cause<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>nothing common, nothing
average.Â  It is the cause of Christ.Â  I testify that the Savior lives.Â  I know
He lives.Â  This is His cause.Â  He directs it in all the earth.Â  It will never
fail.Â  It will continue to grow and prosper and spread.Â  I so witness and
testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -20px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: -20px">Aloha, and greetings from your sister campus in Hawaii.&nbsp; &quot;Mabuhay,&quot; &quot;Malo hoÂ’omou lelei,&quot; 
&quot;Iorana,&quot; &quot;DaÂ’jy<font face="Times New Roman">&#259;</font> hao,&quot; &quot;Talofa,&quot; 
&quot;Konnichiwa,&quot; &quot;Kiaora,&quot; &quot;FakaÂ’ofa atu,&quot; &quot;Bula Vinaka,&quot; &quot;Anyany Hasaio.&quot;&nbsp; Sister Shumway and I are honored and thrilled to be here with you all, and with President and Sister Bednar whom we love and respect deeply. </p>
<p>In Matthew chapter 25 we find three of the Savior's most poignant parables, the parables of the ten virgins, the talents and the sheep and the goats.&nbsp; Uttered in the closing days of his earthly ministry, these parables deal with the most compelling realities human beings can contemplate.&nbsp; They embrace the fundamental purposes of this life and the state of our after life.&nbsp; They are metaphorical narratives about the second coming of Christ, focusing on three central themes, preparation, human capacity and performance, and divine judgment.&nbsp; These parables speak to the crowning moment of truth in time and eternity for you and me.  </p>
<p>I want to concentrate today on the third parable.&nbsp;  As I read it here, listen carefully to the sound as well as the sense of these magnificent lines.&nbsp; For me there is a haunting quality about these verses, the cadences of which are almost like a pounding conscience.&nbsp;  Cadences, I believe, that need to get into our souls, burn into our brains and drive our conscious behavior as disciples of Christ, until righteousness and holiness become unconscious and natural.&nbsp; 
Beginning with verse 31:</p>
<p> When the son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:  </p>
<p> And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats</p>
<p> <i>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</i></p>
<p> Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, come, ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</p>
<p> <i>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in, </i></p>
<p> Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>
<p> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee?&nbsp; Or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  </p>
<p> When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in?&nbsp; Or naked, and clothed thee?</p>
<p> Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>
<p> <i>And the king shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i></p>
<p> Then shall he say unto them on the left hand, depart from me, ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels:</p>
<p> <i>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty and ye gave me no drink: </i></p>
<p> I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</p>
<p> <i>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord when saw we thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison and did not minister unto thee </i></p>
<p> Then shall he answer them saying, Verily I say unto you, in as much as ye did not to one of the least of these, ye did not to me.</p>
<p> <i>And they shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.</i></p>
<p>A number of insights come to mind to help us appreciate and understand this parable.  First, we notice that Christ focuses here on six or seven basic human needs without which a happy existence is impossible:  Food, water, general health, the need to belong and feel accepted, warmth and protection, comfort and freedom.&nbsp; Those who will be on the right hand of God constantly help to fulfill these needs within a suffering humanity.</p>
<p>Of course, each of these conditions has spiritual, psychological and emotional counterparts.&nbsp; Most people around us, for example, are not literally hungry and thirsty, but some may be spiritually starved, even emaciated.&nbsp; Most people are not physically sick, but many hack and cough and are barely breathing spiritually.&nbsp; Most of our acquaintances have numerous social contacts, but many are witheringly lonely inside, feeling left out, unrecognized, unappreciated.&nbsp; Few are literally naked, but many are exposed and vulnerable to the storms of life because they have removed the protective covering of faith and hope.&nbsp; And we donÂ’t need to go to the prisons to discover people who have lost their freedom.&nbsp; Many are incarcerated by their own addictions, caged and fettered by habits they canÂ’t seem to break and attitudes from which they have not yet escaped.</p>
<p>This parable accentuates the human behavior side, or the &quot;works&quot; side, of the Atonement equation.&nbsp; For as Nephi teaches, &quot;we are saved by grace after all we can do&quot; (2 Nephi 25:23), this narrative explains <u> <b>what we must do.</b></u>&nbsp;  It makes it clear that many of the things we value in our religion will not be enough to save us.&nbsp; Personal testimony, for example, is not enough, a temple recommend wonÂ’t do it, visions and ministering of angels, personal healings, a brilliant grasp of the gospel, a righteous lineage; all of the ordinances put together will not do it; the celebrity and universal good opinion of your friends and colleagues in the Church will not do it.&nbsp; Each of these is necessary, but without reaching out to the &quot;least of these, my brethren&quot; they donÂ’t qualify us.</p>
<p>Notice in the parable the shift in perspective away from the point of view of doing as Christ did (as in &quot;Come Follow Me&quot; or &quot;As you see me do, so do ye also,&quot;).&nbsp; In this parable the Lord seems to say &quot;whatever good <u>you do</u> or <u>donÂ’t do</u> to someone else you do it or donÂ’t do it to me.&quot;&nbsp; From this perspective not only do the disciples represent Christ as authorized emissaries, but so do the people themselves represent Christ to whom the disciples are supposed to minister.&nbsp; Thus, Christ becomes either a beneficiary or victim of our actions.&nbsp; We bless and nourish and sustain Christ in the act of blessing, nourishing, and sustaining even the <u>least</u> of human kind.&nbsp; Or we ignore Him, neglect and despise Him, as we ignore, neglect or despise even the least of mankind.  </p>
<p>Hence Mother Theresa could point to the bitterest examples of human wretchedness and say &quot;Behold Jesus Christ in all His distressing disguises.&quot;&nbsp; ChristÂ’s identification with needy humanity signals how precious they are to Him and Heavenly Father.&nbsp; The worth of souls idea is also captured in previous parables such as that of the Prodigal Son, the Lost Sheep, and the Lost Coin.</p>
<p>This sheep and goat parable offers another insight, namely that the righteous seem to be surprised that theyÂ’ve done anything good to Christ personally.&nbsp; They seem unaware of their own goodness.&nbsp; Their works are driven by a righteous nature and a righteous motive unaware and perhaps unconcerned about rewards for their behavior.  </p>
<p>Likewise those who are condemned are astonished, perhaps a bit indignant, that they stand accused of victimizing Christ because they didnÂ’t treat others with the regard and love and service Christ expected of them.&nbsp; Again, notice that each one of the items listed does not automatically imply any of the trappings that are commonly attributed to a religious life, such as church attendance, Church position or rank, priesthood authority, or eloquent public prayers.&nbsp; These things have meaning only as they mesh with and magnify the <u>works</u> of discipleship.</p>
<p>What this constitutes is a private, personal ministry that flows out spontaneously and naturally, often in unrecorded, unacknowledged, even unremembered acts of kindness. </p>
<p>Clearly, serving a mission for the Church puts us in a concentrated learning mode for persistent daily selfless service, where your own ministry becomes the LordÂ’s ministry, a ministry that carries you to many of the &quot;least of these, my brethren.&quot;&nbsp; Our daughter, Emily, when serving in Austria, wrote home the following:</p>
<p>Sister Hopkins and I were asked to go sit with our non-member friend, a manic-depressive lady who gets so stricken with depression and anguish over her immoral behavior, when in her panic spells . . . she wants to commit suicide.&nbsp; We sat with her for eight hours.&nbsp; Part of the time she was thrashing, weeping and wailing in her bed, in the gall of bitterness.&nbsp; She felt that she had ruined her life and that of her family and that everyone would be better off if she were dead.&nbsp; I could feel my heart bleeding real blood for her and I was filled with the desire to do anything to help her.</p>
<p>We reviewed all of the usual wonderful doctrines about the atonement, forgiveness, her </p>
<p>I remember the example of another sister missionary just returning back to our community.&nbsp; I asked her, &quot;Besides seeing an investigator baptized, what was your favorite activity in the mission field?&quot;&nbsp; Sister T<font face="Times New Roman">&#333;</font>f<font face="Times New Roman">&#257;</font> looked at me and said, &quot;I believe I liked Â‘the searchÂ’ the most, knocking on doors.&nbsp; We would get yelled at a lot and doors would slam in our faces.&nbsp; Some people thought I was crazy and would ask Â‘how can you keep going when you are so violently rejected so often.Â’&nbsp; I simply answered them saying, Â‘I keep going because I know that despite multiple rejections, some day, somewhere, I am going to knock on a door and someone will open it and say to me, &quot;Oh, please come in, we have been waiting for you.Â’&quot;</p>
<p>Those of us who have served missions, when we returned, what were the impediments or distractions that gradually hardened our hearts and dulled our sensibilities to the needs of &quot;the least of these, my brethren?&quot;&nbsp; First, I believe is that we cease to pray the way we did in the mission field.&nbsp;  Some of us no longer specifically ask with the same fervor for opportunities to help others.&nbsp; Remember in the mission field, our prayers were filled with petitions to find and teach and baptize.&nbsp; How often did we fast and pray for a struggling family or a confused and wayward investigator or member.  </p>
<p>In the mission field we didnÂ’t just say prayers, we lived and breathed your prayers.  The language of our prayers was constantly filled with the names of others, their challenges, and their predicaments.&nbsp; After our missions, things change.&nbsp;  Obviously we now have many worthy and often required activities that fill our time.&nbsp; But, we must not let our prayers become shallow and self-centered, filled again with clich&eacute;s and thoughtless phrases.&nbsp; We need to continue to ask the Lord for his spirit to prompt us to pray for others.&nbsp; Yet, in all of this we must remember especially that even eloquent and specific prayers must be connected to righteous service.&nbsp; Consider again AmulekÂ’s long list of what we should pray for as recorded in Alma 34, beginning in verse 20.&nbsp; Notice how this series of cries to the Lord constitute a crescendo that climaxes in verses 26, 27, 28 and 29:</p>
<p>26.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9;<i>But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.</i></p>
<p>27.<i>&nbsp; Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto Him continually for your welfare, <b>and also for the welfare of those who are around you.</b></i></p>
<p>28.<i>&nbsp; And behold my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in needÂ—I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold your prayer is vain and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.</i></p>
<p>29.<i>&nbsp; Therefore if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, who the refiners do cast out,</i> (it being of no worth)<i> and is trodden underfoot of men</i> 
(emphasis added).</p>
<p>I remember a touching testimony by a mother with three little children.  Speaking at the pulpit, she carried her new baby.  Another was tugging at her skirt.  She said:</p>
<p>When I see on TV little children and mothers suffering, when I see their emaciated and starved little bodies, itÂ’s like a knife in my heart and I cry out Â‘what can I do, I am poor, far away, with three needy children of my own.  I am helpless.Â’&nbsp;  But then it dawns on me that there are two things I can do.&nbsp;  I can pray and I can cry and the Lord will consecrate my tears in their behalf.</p>
<p>My own mother was semi-invalid for many years before she died, a shut-in who was absolutely delighted when anyone came by to visit or just to say hello.&nbsp; Coming up to meetings in Provo, I would stay with her, looking forward to our prayers together.&nbsp; But then in the middle of the night, I would often hear her from the bedroom next to ours.&nbsp; It was a conversation between her and someone.&nbsp; One time I stood at the door and eavesdropped on my sweet motherÂ’s prayers that went on for 30 or 40 minutes.&nbsp; I was amazed at how far and wide her prayer ranged.&nbsp; The specificity.&nbsp; Each child, each grandchild, and even beyond her posterity.  </p>
<p>I believe that righteous prayers will deploy angels to the spot where we cannot go ourselves.&nbsp; I believe that it is in our prayers that our own souls are shaped and tutored, again when they are linked to personal action where we are able.</p>
<p>A few years ago, in a prayer on our campus, someone asked a blessing upon the President of the United States by name.&nbsp; This PresidentÂ’s immorality was public knowledge.&nbsp; There seemed to be a disturbance among some of our students.&nbsp; &quot;How can you pray for such a man in such a meeting?&nbsp; His name is a pollution to an environment like ours.&quot;&nbsp; The answer came from the person who offered the prayer.  &quot;Are we to pray for only the righteous?&nbsp; If so, who among us could we pray for?&quot;</p>
<p>Lately, we have heard and offered countless prayers for and in behalf of our armed forces.&nbsp; We beg for their safety, their families, we suffer for those who have lost spouses, daddies, even mommies.&nbsp; We beg for their safe return and a quick resolution to this conflict.&nbsp; I was very touched by a childÂ’s prayer recently that included the frightened children in Iraq who also have lost mommies and daddies and who are terrorized by the bombs, and an invading army whose intentions they do not understand but fear the worst.&nbsp; These are children and parents who have been abused and oppressed by one of the most evil dictators of our time, but who are also in harmÂ’s way, being used as human shields, facing the most fearsome fire power in the planetÂ’s history.&nbsp; This child prayed for them, too.</p>
<p>Besides shallow prayers, there are other impediments to our doing unto &quot;the least of them, my brethren.&quot;&nbsp; One is a subtle cynicism and mockery of those who do try to do good the best way they know how.&nbsp; I remember the heartbreak of a story about a new convert who was so full of the joy and light of his own conversion that he wanted to express his love and appreciation to everybody.&nbsp;  He would come early to sacrament meetings and go about shaking hands with everyone, old and young.  Perhaps he was a little too effervescent, but I think his enthusiasm for greeting people did the ward good, until one poor irritated soul said to him, &quot;Oh, go sit down, George, people will think youÂ’re running for Bishop.&quot;&nbsp; A few people around him laughed at the joke.&nbsp; George, however, was absolutely crushed that his genuinely loving behavior was held up to public ridicule.&nbsp; He sank within himself and was never the same again.  </p>
<p>Sometimes we donÂ’t do good things to the &quot;least of these my brethren,&quot; because we judge them.&nbsp; We put a label on them and then rationalize our misbehavior or our non-behavior toward them.&nbsp; Years ago, we moved in next door to an older couple who yelled so loud at each other, I was first disturbed, then disgusted by what sounded like constant quarreling.&nbsp; My resentment of the couple for all this noise kept me from making their acquaintance.&nbsp; &quot;Little wonder no one visits them,&quot; I thought.&nbsp; As time went on, however, I suspected that they must be lonely.&nbsp; I was not aware of any family coming to see them.&nbsp; After many months, I mentioned this to another neighbor and wondered if I should visit them.&nbsp; This neighbor said, &quot;I think it would be a great idea, but when you visit them, youÂ’ll have to yell because they are both nearly deaf.&quot;</p>
<p>There is abundant scripture warning against judging others or withholding our attention or our comfort because they &quot;arenÂ’t our type,&quot; or they donÂ’t quite fit in our circle of friends.</p>
<p>One of the great things about a mission is that you seldom hear a missionary say, &quot;I canÂ’t teach this family the gospel.&nbsp; They arenÂ’t my type.&quot;&nbsp; One of the blessings of missionariesÂ’ desperation to find investigators is that they learn very quickly that everyone is their typeÂ–fat, thin, rich, poor and outcast.&nbsp; The genius of the Church includes the policy that we all worship within our ward boundaries.&nbsp; Unlike many other denominations, we donÂ’t shop around for a Bishop we like or the congregation we want to associate with.&nbsp;  We take the ward family that we get.&nbsp; And in most wards and stakes, there is wonderful diversity, numerous people who fit all of the needy requirements of Mathew 25, literally and figuratively, hungry, lonely, naked, and in prison.</p>
<p>Another reason some of us donÂ’t reach out to the &quot;least of these, my brethren,&quot; is that sometimes we donÂ’t think we have anything to offer.&nbsp; We are intimidated by our lack of resources or personality.&nbsp;  Sometimes we are paralyzed by fear, fear of rejection or our own incompetence.&nbsp; We say, &quot;What could I say or do to lift or help the likes of him?&quot;  </p>
<p>Years ago, as a campus stake president, I called a local Tongan brother to serve on the stake high council.&nbsp; &quot;But how can I serve in a university stake?&quot;&nbsp;  He protested, &quot;I know very little English.&nbsp; IÂ’ve had no formal education.&nbsp;  I will be a laughing stock among all those smart students.&quot;&nbsp; This man recited a list of reasons why he couldnÂ’t possibly serve among smart people.&nbsp; I held to my conviction that this appointment was from the Lord.&nbsp; His wife finally said in her own native tongue, &quot;I know my husband.&nbsp; I know his weaknesses.&nbsp; He is a good man and if the Lord wants him to speak in any language, I know he will find a way to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>This man did serve in the BYU-Hawaii Stake for several years.&nbsp; For the first few weeks, he was in torment with fears and feelings of inferiority but he took his calling seriously.&nbsp; When he had to speak in his role as high councilor, he prepared with all his might, mind and strength.&nbsp; He practiced in front of his mirror.&nbsp; He memorized and recited and repeated over and over the difficult lines.&nbsp; You can all predict what happened.&nbsp; This brother became one of the most popular speakers in the Stake.&nbsp;  He never became fluent in English but he had a humble style and a fervor and wonderfully fresh ways of putting words together.&nbsp; That made him beloved and appreciated.&nbsp; When he stood at the pulpit before all those smart people, they paid rapt attention.&nbsp; He fed the hungry, gave drink to the thirsty and liberated the captive.</p>
<p>Another impediment to personal, tender service unto the &quot;least of these,&quot; is our addiction to amusement.&nbsp; Personal amusement fills up our leisure time, our time off from school or work.&nbsp; Entertainment becomes an obsession, a way of life, looking for new thrills or the same thrills over and over.&nbsp; IÂ’m talking about <b>amusement abuse</b>, not the occasional soul-restoring recreation or exercise.</p>
<p>But some of us may be amusing ourselves to death, perhaps to spiritual death.&nbsp; We accumulate myriads of toys.&nbsp; Our lives are stretched out along the vast continuum of all kinds of sports, going out to dinner, TV programs, extended vacations, movies, video games.&nbsp; Addictive amusement keeps some people even from missions or locks them into the same set of long-time wealthy friends, golf buddies, or fishing buddies.</p>
<p>Let me share with you how some &quot;sports-nuts&quot; transform their addictions into wonderful service opportunities.&nbsp; One of our employees at BYU-Hawaii, a brilliant athlete in his day, loves BYU-Hawaii basketball.&nbsp; He shows up before the lights are on, tingling with anticipation.&nbsp; He told a congregation recently how his joy in basketball has increased by the companions he keeps at the games.  </p>
<p>One night he brought with him an elderly man from an assisted living center next door.&nbsp;  The man hadnÂ’t been out at night for years.&nbsp; My friend said, &quot;My elderly companion was absolutely mesmerized by the lights, the crowds, the excitement.&nbsp;  I became excited myself.&nbsp; I bought him popcorn.&nbsp;  At half time I went down to the athletic director and secured a BYU-Hawaii t-shirt and presented it to my elderly friend.&nbsp; He was so thrilled that he pulled off his shirt right down to the skin and put on his BYU-Hawaii Seasiders t-shirt.&quot;&nbsp; The punch line to my friendÂ’s address was, &quot;In all my life I have never enjoyed a basketball game so much.&quot;</p>
<p>I love the story of the golf addict who in a spiritual moment decided to take a new set of friends each time he went to play golf.&nbsp; That decision led to his inviting troubled teenagers from the inner city to come and learn a game of skill in a beautiful setting with clean air and clean company.&nbsp; Every golfing outing became a highlight in his life, not because of the game itself but the company he kept.&nbsp; Their gratitude knew no bounds and many of these youth were benefited emotionally and spiritually by the things they learned about discipline, concentration, coordination, and other things you learn when you gain a skill. </p>
<p>A similar story is told about a fly fishing fanatic who decided to organize a little fly fishing club among poor minorities in the inner city.&nbsp; They, too, were greatly improved as human beings getting out into nature, learning the art of fly fishing.&nbsp; He was a catch-and-release man.&nbsp; Many of his troubled learners were malnourished and asked if they could catch-and-keep, at which point he taught them how to prepare a delicious trout or bass.</p>
<p>In the end, my dear young friends, brothers and sisters, the art of nourishing even &quot;the least of these, my brethren,&quot; begins at the heart, to see as Christ sees, and feel as Christ feels toward those who carry burdens that we cannot see or appreciate, or comprehend if we did see.&nbsp; This unconscious flow of righteousness outward must begin in and be nourished by the home, and then in the wonderful ward assignments we have, home teaching and visiting teaching in the true sense of being caretakers of souls.&nbsp; Our love for Christ is best measured by our love and caring for the &quot;least of these, my brethren.&quot;</p>
<p>Surely personal worthiness, total and complete chastity, and all of the personal qualities of holiness are important.&nbsp; But in the end, all goodness must be translated into the manner of how we treat each other, and especially, how we treat those who have for whatever reason been damaged by the vicissitudes of this world.</p>
<p>We have talked today about a personal, private, largely silent ministry; about worshipping by serving suffering humanity, about the power of sincere prayer meshed with spontaneous acts of kindness, about GodÂ’s business becoming our business, his errand becoming ours; we have talked about position and authority and public responsibility being only part of our larger stewardship to help, to lift, and to inspire the &quot;least of these, my brethren.&quot;</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to share a tender story a close friend recounted to me recently.</p>
<p>It is about his son who was discouraged and miserable just after arriving in a foreign mission.&nbsp; No matter how the parents and others pleaded with the young missionary, he said he couldnÂ’t take it and wanted to come home.&nbsp; In a reception during a training session with some general authorities, the distraught father just mentioned in passing to President Hinckley about his sonÂ’s struggle.&nbsp; The parents continued to plead with the son to stay, but his early return home seemed imminent.  </p>
<p>The following week an envelope from the First PresidencyÂ’s office arrived at the parentsÂ’ home.&nbsp;  Inside was a copy of a letter that had been sent to their son.&nbsp; The letter had been hand-typed from a typewriter and very tenderly addressed to the discouraged Elder.&nbsp; It was a several-page letter, full of encouragement and the writerÂ’s own missionary experiences about faith and sticking to it.&nbsp; The letter was warm, loving, thoughtful, personal, and signed, &quot;Sincerely, your brother, President Gordon B. Hinckley.&quot;</p>
<p>It is little wonder that shortly thereafter, the Elder wrote to his parents and said he was staying.&nbsp; This Elder not only stayed, but flourished and became a mighty power for good among the people of his mission.</p>
<p>Think of it!  President Hinckley, in spite of his age, is such a public figure, revered for his extensive speeches, books, and his general leadership in the Church.&nbsp; Yet, he conducts a private, silent ministry as well to bless others individually.&nbsp; Can you imagine how that single unselfish act of a Prophet will be treasured not only in this young manÂ’s life but in his posterity?</p>

had the opportunity this past weekend to receive counsel from prophets, seers,
and revelators and others of our leaders who love us and want us to be the very
best that we can.Â  How blessed we are to be living during this season of the
history of the Church when the fulness of the gospel has been restored.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thank you for
that kind introduction.Â  A few things were left out, however, that I think are
note worthy, so I hope you will indulge me for a few moments while I add a
little.Â  I think you may be interested to know that I never lost an election
for school office.Â  I</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ve never once had a bad landing while sky
diving, or have had to quit before finishing a marathon, and I haven</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:

major magazine.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All of this
could be quite impressive unless you understood that I have never failed in any
of these efforts because I have never attempted to do any of them.Â  So, in
reality, lack of my failure in these areas cannot at all be construed as any
sort of success or accomplishment.Â  In fact, if no failure were the desired
measure, we could spend our entire lives being very safe but experiencing
minimal progress in many realms of our existence.<sup>1 </sup></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Perhaps failure
is on my mind because as I look to the future only a few short weeks, I</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:

fast approaching.Â  For some this will be a happy culmination of all your hard
work, and the stream of A</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>s covering your report card will once
again reinforce why you have such a healthy self-esteem.Â Â  For others, in spite
of hard work and months of sleep deprivation the results of your efforts could
cause you to question if you are even college material. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I well remember
one of my first semesters at the university.Â  I was taking a physics course and
had dutifully attended each session, taking copious notes.Â  There were times I
had actually picked up the text and read portions of it, and so I felt somewhat
confident as I walked into class the day of my first midterm.Â  That was a
memorable experience for me, and one I am not likely to soon forget.Â  I sat down
at my desk with the exam and read through the questions on the first page, and
then the following pages.Â  I just sat there dazed for a few moments, unable to
answer any question, when finally a brilliant thought occurred to me.Â  I got
up, walked to the back and checked the number on the door with the hope that I
had accidentally walked into the wrong room.Â  That hope quickly died as I
immediately realized that I was indeed in the correct room, on the correct day,
with the correct test in front of me.Â  Sadly, as I returned to my seat with
pencil in hand and an untouched answer sheet next to the test, I had to come to
grips with the fact that there was hardly a question that evoked even an
inkling of familiarity for me.Â  So, I did the only thing I could, under the
circumstances.Â  I panicked and burst into tears </span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
and in the end gave a much less than stellar performance on the exam.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My father was a
professor at that same university, and he highly valued both education and hard
work.Â  He often used to tell us children, </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You can do anything in this world you
want if you are willing to pay the price.Â  And if you really want it, the price
will be worth it.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Â  I really wanted to not fail physics,
but it was clear that the price I would have to pay would be much more than I
had given to my studies in high school.Â  I moped and worried, got angry and
then depressed.Â  Finally, I paid the price meaning in this case, I put in the
kind of hard work a college physics class demanded and, although definitely not
the class star, I am happy to report that in the end I passed the course.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That was
actually a critical point in my life as I had to acknowledge that no matter how

us that </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No one was foreordained to fail...Let us

self-discipline and good work habits, he still would have great opportunities

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sometimes
rejections come from others.Â  At other times we do a very good job of creating
our own difficult circumstances because of lack of thought or preparation or
because we let our emotions take over.Â  Regardless, in the end each of us
individually must decide how we will respond, one by one, to situations which
confront us.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let me share one
more personal experience, if I may, that occurred when I was 20 years old,
about the same age as many of you.Â  I was invited by a group of acquaintances
to go on a five day river trip here in Idaho.Â  This was a group who had run a
number of rivers and there just happened to be an extra opening for this
particular trip.Â  I must confess that I gave little thought to what this
adventure would actually involve.Â  As I was preparing, my concerns were more
focused on coordinating outfits and making sure I had my water proof sun
block.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The first touch
of reality hit when I saw that our bags were being lashed onto the rafts.Â  It
had made sense to me that we put everything in waterproof bags since water from
the river might, of course, splash into the boat.Â  It just hadn</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>t occurred to me that anything from inside the boat might go
over the edge into the river.Â  This reality was reinforced as we were given
gear to wear.Â  First, a super duper extreme life jacket made specifically to
turn the wearer face up in the event that she might be knocked unconscious <u>when</u>
</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> not if </span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
but when she was plummeted out of the raft while going through a set of
rapids.Â  Added to that was a life belt and a helmet.Â  This was followed by a
brief lesson on how to go through the rapids without a boat </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'> hands and feet first so that we could push off of rocks as
we were being swept down river.Â  Images of sun bathing and leisurely floating
along were fast disappearing from my thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While standing
there, trying to reconcile my rather undefined but definitely mild expectations
with what was right in front of me, I noticed the leader of our group having an
animated conversation with the forest ranger.Â  I moseyed over to see if I could
hear what was being said.Â  The forest ranger was trying to discourage our group
from beginning our trip.Â  The river was extremely high and, in this case, that
meant that it would be more dangerous than usual.Â  In fact, just the day before
a man had been killed going over the first falls.Â  There were two bits of very
important information for me from the comments I overhead.Â  First, while at
that age I was typically game for high adventure experiences, drowning on a
river trip was a little higher than I was willing to go.Â  Second was the word </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>falls.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Â  No one had mentioned anything about
going over a waterfall.Â  In reality, it turned out to be only about 10 feet
high, but 10 feet from the security of solid ground off shore looks quite
different than 10 feet when you</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>re sitting in a little, flimsy rubber
raft while gazing at white water swirling wildly below.Â  After much discussion,
and in spite of my concerns, we were finally given permission to go and the
river trip began.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After only a
brief time on the river, we pulled to the side and hiked up a short distance to
see what was ahead of us and to make plans for negotiating the rapids.Â  We
first had to go through Ping Pong Alley, so named because the large boulders
caused the small rafts to bounce along like little ping pong balls.Â  This was
not a particularly dangerous area, but Velvet Falls followed right after.Â  This
is where the man had died the day before because his boat had gone over the
edge side-ways and had rapidly filled with the backwash of the falls, making it
impossible for him to float ahead out of harm</span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>s
way.Â  Once through Ping Pong Alley, the critical point was to go over the falls
with the raft facing straight on.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There were a few
boats ahead of us and we could see them disappearing one by one over the edge.Â 
Finally it was our turn and just as we approached the waterfall, our boat was
knocked sideways.Â  Terror filled my heart.Â  I wondered what my water logged
body would look like in a casket.Â  Would anyone come to my funeral?Â  Fortuitously,
just at the critical moment, the person in the middle seat of our raft took the
oars and turned us around backwards </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> but straight.Â  I think I will never
forget the feeling, as I looked over the edge of the boat, literally hanging on
for dear life to the ropes attached to the sides of the boat as we plummeted
over the edge.Â  I</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>m happy to report that we survived.Â 
There was no time to relax, however, because we had to immediately begin
bailing out the water which had filled our boat.Â  Then we paddled wildly to get
into position for the next rapids.Â  And that</span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>s
how it was the entire day.Â  Paddle like crazy.Â  Hang on for dear life.Â  Bail.Â 
Paddle.Â  Hang on. Bail.Â  By the time we pulled onto shore for the night I was
exhausted.Â  My hands and knuckles were bloodied from being knocked around
through the rapids.Â  My muscles were sore.Â  I had lost one of my sneakers along
the way.Â  It was raining and I was cold.Â  I had never gotten unscared the
entire day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I went up to the
leader of the group that night and said, I</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>m not normally a quitter, but I just can</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>t do this for 4 more days.Â  This is too hard and I can</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>t stay terrified for this long.Â  He was so kind and so
understanding and finally he said, </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>re right. You can</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>t do it.Â  You</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ll never make it to the end.Â  You should
just quit right this minute.Â  But there</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>s a detail you ought to know before
making a decision, and it</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>s that there are only two ways out of
here.Â  One is on the rafts with our group.Â  The other is to walk out on your
own.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Â  I looked down at my shoeless foot and
up the steeply rising mountains on both sides with no apparent trails
anywhere.Â  And immediately I rejected his rejection and determined to ride the
river.Â  I finally got the hang of river running and was even able to enjoy the
trip.Â  It was still hard work, and my stomach churned with each rapid, but in
the end it turned out to be one of the most powerful experiences of my life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I tell you this
story to make two points.Â  Sometimes we are valiant and noble and just refuse
to be defeated.Â  Other times we don</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>t give in, not because of any seeming
greatness of character on our part, but because there really isn</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>t a viable choice.Â  Regardless, not allowing ourselves to be
overcome by despair reaps benefits.Â Â  We still learn and grow by working
through the difficult tasks of life.Â  The second point is that a lot of those
difficulties cannot be controlled by us.Â  There are natural laws with resulting
consequences, everyone around us has the right to exercise agency, we do not
have the power to fix every problem.Â  Life presents us with all kinds of white
water rapids and the best we can do is be prepared before they hit, remain as
calm as possible when we</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>re in the middle of them, and that may
mean relying on a higher power than ours, and then do those things that will
give us maximum control afterwards.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even the most
holy and elect of God</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>s servants have had moments of facing
their own version of white water rapids </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> of feeling out of control and uncertain
about the journey ahead, and thus being hesitant to proceed.Â  When the Lord
first approached Enoch with a special calling, Enoch</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>s response was this as recorded in Moses 6:31: </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>I am but a lad and all the people hate me.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Â  He wasn</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>t just being humble or exaggerating the
challenges ahead of him.Â  In truth he was young and the people really did not
like him or want to hear what he had to say.Â  He didn</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>t know how he was going to accomplish what was asked of him,
but he was prepared and he trusted that the Lord would help him.Â  Because he
didn</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>t give up, because he hung on through the
ups and downs, an entire city of his brothers and sisters were taken back to
our Father in Heaven in the most special of ways.Â Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In Exodus we
read of another of our great prophets, Moses.Â  You recall his response to the
Lord</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>s calling for him to lead the children of
Israel out of bondage.Â  </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I am slow of speech,</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><sup><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>7</span></sup><span style='font-family:

countries or who have learned another language know how quickly you can lose
ability with that language when you haven</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>t used it for a while.Â  Remember that at
the time of Moses</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>s calling, it had been 40 years since he
had spoken either Egyptian or Hebrew.Â  The prospect of trying to communicate
effectively with Pharoah and his leaders as well as with the hundreds of
thousands of Israelites on such an important issue must have been daunting.Â 
Who could have blamed him had he refused to venture into such dangerous
unknowns, a journey that would last 40 more years?Â  But he didn</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>t say no.Â  He refused to fail the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The prophet

did.Â  He clearly felt the weight of such hefty responsibilities demanded of a
prophet a God, a prophet to the world.Â  Yet he moved forward and has continued
with extraordinary strength and wisdom.Â  Elder Neal Maxwell has reminded us
that </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>there is a difference...between being </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>&gt;</span><span style='font-family:

and growth opportunities, trusting that the Lord is there to help us negotiate
the rapids. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I promise that
each of you will have many white water experiences during your life times.Â  If
you are not in the middle of one right now, another is probably right around
the bend.Â  You can panic or be overwhelmed and quit, or you can hold on with
all your might.Â  Sometimes that may mean the white knuckle kind of holding on,
not just casual, gentle touches. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As righteous
youth of the Church, I know you are often compared to the armies of Helaman.Â 
Especially given the current events of the world, I too cannot resist the
comparison.Â  I reflect on what Mormon told us about his abridgement of the
sacred records which had been handed down from generation to generation; that
he could write only one-hundredth of what was there.Â  Obviously, with the Lord</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>s help he had to pick and choose what would be of most value
to the people of our day, the intended audience for the book, and the result is
that fully 1/3 of the Book of Mormon is about wars and fighting.Â  Perhaps now
is the very time that he foresaw.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For me, one of
the most dramatic of all these stories in the Book of Mormon is of the
Stripling Warriors.Â  This was a difficult time as the powerful Lamanites were
literally destroying everything of their enemies </span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
their homes, and lands, and families.Â  As terrible as it was, the
Anti-Nephi-Lehis feared for their eternal salvation more than for their lives
and the temporal things of this world, and they remained true to their promise
never to fight again.Â  Their children, the 2000 young men we now know as the army
of Helaman, or the stripling warriors, watched in horror at the atrocities of
the attacking army.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These young men
honored the promises of their fathers, but felt compelled to action
themselves.Â  I imagine those young men were very much like you students here in
Idaho </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> bright, hard working, caring, righteous
young people.Â  But...they were NOT soldiers, nor had they ever been trained to
fight or to go into battle.Â  And perhaps most telling of them is what they did
as they made their decision to try to protect home and family.Â  They did not
approach a great general or experienced military leader for help, as some might
have thought wise.Â  They went to their prophet, Helaman, who, as you recall,
also had not been trained in the ways of war.Â  The young people were clear that
if they had any chance of victory, it would not be because they had been
prepared in brilliant stratagem, by the standards of the world, but because the
Lord would be on their side.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As they prepared
for their first battle, they realized they would be facing the largest and most
powerful of the Lamanite armies.Â  What were they feeling as they had to come
face to face with the reality of the consequences that their commitment to
fight might personally mean?Â  The circumstances would have demanded that they
summon every ounce of faith and courage they could muster.Â  Undoubtedly they
must have had some feelings of trepidation, but they trusted their prophet and
had faith in the protecting power of the Lord.Â  I believe they understood as
Elisha had on another occasion that </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>they that be with us are greater than
they that be with them.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><sup><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>10</span></sup><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Â  They knew the Lord would enlist the support of divine
spiritual forces.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As we all know,
these young men fought and were victorious.Â  And, in spite of the obvious
imbalance of the two armies, as measured by the great differences in training
and experience, this is the only time I recall in the entire Book of Mormon
when it is specifically stated that not one soldier</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>s life of the winning army was lost.Â  Not one.Â  This was
nothing short of a miracle.Â  There is an explanation given to us in Alma 52 :21
which tells us the stripling warriors did </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>observe and perform every word and
command with exactness.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> How often could that be said of each of
us?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The fighting of
the Stripling Warriors and the current events we have been watching nightly on
the news represent one type of war.Â  Happily you are all safely here in Rexburg
for the time being, far from the reality of the war in Iraq.Â  I would suggest
to you that there is another more constant, pervasive and dangerous war
happening right here where we are, and it is the fight for our very souls.Â  The
attacks often come with surgical precision as the weapons of destruction
infiltrate our hearts and minds almost seemingly undetected.Â  They are
disguised as lyrics to music, harmless TV sitcoms, images in the media,
addictions, peer pressure.Â  Because Satan has been in battle so long, he has
become adept in the strategies that lure us into dangerous war zones away from
true security and protection.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This latter type
of war is not new to us.Â  In fact, President Gordon B. Hinckley has said,Â  </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>We are involved in the same battle that went on before the
world was created.Â  It is the battle between truth and error, between the
design of the Almighty and his Beloved Son, on the one hand, and Lucifer, the
son of the morning, on the other.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><sup><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>11</span></sup><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Â  There is little written about that pre-existent struggle,
but the scriptures have given us some important insights.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our Heavenly
Father presented a plan to His children.Â  He would create a world on which we
would be challenged, experience weakness and failure, but which would provide
the exact kind of training ground necessary for us to progress to an exalted
state.Â Â  I can picture the dilemma this created for us: The opportunity to
become as our Father in Heaven and to live with Him eternally, but
understanding that what would be required of us to reach that goal was beyond
any talents or power that we possessed on our own.Â  Lucifer presented an option
he said would guarantee we would make no mistakes.Â  All we had to do was
relinquish to him our right to make decisions for ourselves, and he would
handle everything.Â  From the perspective we now have that seems a ludicrous
proposal since it would obviously defeat the very purpose of this earthly
estate.Â  However, on a simple, insecure level I can understand how appealing
this may have been.Â  There have been a number of particularly difficult times
in my life when I have wished that someone else could just take care of the
problems and resolve them to my liking.Â  I may have even petitioned the Lord to
deal with issues I didn</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>t fully understand were within my ability
and responsibility to handle.Â  I must confess there have also been those times
when I have wished I had the power to take control for my own children when
they have struggled.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apparently Satan</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:

one-third of the hosts of heaven we are told.Â  The Lord</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>s plan may have felt too risky, and perhaps Lucifer was able
to entice them to his way of thinking by capitalizing on their fear of failing
during this state of probation.Â  The result is that this one-third will never
have the blessing of being able to fail at or struggle with any of the earthly
challenges that have and will continue to confront each of us, and that is
because, at least in part, at a key time they chose not to try.Â  That decision
eliminated for them the opportunity to progress, which condemns them to a state
of misery forever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Lord wants
us to have choices and trusts that we will be able to deal with their

Heavenly Father to watch us blunder through some of life</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>s challenges, He would never deny us the opportunities for
growth that come by having us contend with difficulties, by refusing to be
defeated.Â  In fact, He has clearly stated that His work and His glory is to
bring us safely home and His plan would assuredly include a way for us to
fulfill his purposes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jesus understood
the plan.Â  He understood that each of us individually must travel the path that
leads back to our Father in Heaven.Â  He also understood that we could not do it
alone, that what we had to offer would not be enough.Â  It was He who volunteered
to make up the difference for what each of us would lack in all ways </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span><span style='font-family:

the part of the test designed to make it difficult to return to Him, it is what

faith is not to see what we will do without Him but to see what we can do with
Him.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><sup><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>12</span></sup></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Good afternoon, brothers and sisters.Â  It's good to be with
you.Â  I have unbounded respect and admiration for President Bednar who presides
over this University.Â  I treasure the experiences he and I have shared in the
past.Â  Further, in the past we have had daughters and grand daughters attend
what was then Ricks College.Â  I consider it a rare privilege to be invited to
speak at this devotional.Â  It seems that it has been only a few months since I
last had this opportunity, but realizing that it will likely not come againÂ—I have struggled in an
unusual way for guidance in selecting a subject and developing some thoughts
that would do justice to your being here this afternoon.Â  My prayers and
pleadings have been many.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It seems to me that our needs and interests change as we
pass thru the different seasons of our life.Â  As I have grown older and have
experienced many of the needs that are common to every season, I have come to
realize that each period has its own different and unique challenges.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have also come to understand that there are many many good
things that matter in life and that as each one is pursued, our joy and
happiness will increase.Â  But because we can't do every needed thing all at
once, we often get frustrated with our performance, as we try to pick and
choose our particular course of action.Â  We often speak of &quot;coming unto
Christ&quot;, but we are not always sure just what that means, or the path to
pursue, or the process we should follow.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are so many good choices to be made.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have found the greatest challenge in life<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>regardless of the season
you're in<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>is to find
those things that really matter the most and put them on center stage in our lives
and concentrate on their development.Â  As we do this, unnumbered and unusual
blessings begin to unfold.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the most important things are attended to first<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>then all else that is
really important in life will fall appropriately into place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most of us are busy doing a host of things that do matter in
our lives, however, some of them are being done at the expense of other efforts
that are even more important.Â  The weightier matters are too often set aside to
be attended to later.Â  I have also found out that often the issues we face are
not always decisions between right or wrong, but they can be and often are
between two right choices.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So the question, what does matter the most?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To begin with, I would like to visit with those of you who
have become discouraged in your personal prayers, the ones you say when no one
else is listening.Â  I'd like to visit with those of you who have stopped
praying or who don't pray as frequently or as fervently as you once did.Â 
Perhaps you find it difficult to pray because you aren't sure the Lord is
listening; maybe you aren't sure if He is even there; or maybe you feel guilty
or unworthy.Â  But whatever the reason, your communication isn't what it ought
to be<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>or what you
would like it to be.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Have you ever knelt down alone and asked the Lord for
something that is really important to you, and then found that your prayer
wasn't answered as you had hoped?Â  I have.Â  Have you ever prayed and prayed for
days and days for something special, and then found that it didn't work out the
way you had wanted?Â  I have.Â  In times past, on more that a few occasions, I
have gotten up off my knees and wondered in despair, &quot;what's the use?Â  He
isn't even listening,&quot;Â  or &quot;maybe I just don't understand the
signals.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A few years ago, after one such frustrating experience in
prayer, I was reflecting on my experiences with my earthly father, who has been
gone several years now.Â  I remembered that when he was alive, I could always go
to him and talk to him about anything, and he would listen to me, even when I
had made a mistake or had done something wrong.Â  My dad was not a perfect man
(but nearly so), but he would listen.Â  Surely a perfect Father in Heaven would
also listen<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>every
time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I want you to know that I knowÂ  that whenever one of Heavenly
Father's children kneels and talks to him, he listens.Â  I know this as well as
I know anything in this world; Heavenly Father does listen to every prayer from
His children.Â  I know our prayers ascend to heaven.Â  No matter what we may have
done wrong, he listens to us<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>he
hears our pleadings and cries for help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, I also believe He answers us.Â  Often we forget that His
time table for answering and ours are not always the same.Â  I do not believe He
ignores His children when they talk to him.Â  Often the problem in our
communication with the Lord is that not all of us have learned how to listen
for His answers, or perhaps we are not prepared to hear him.Â  I believe we
receive His answers as we prepare ourselves to receive them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now let me explain this.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Last year my wife and I went to the beautiful lake district
in Northern England.Â  There we saw some of the greenest lush meadows and
hillsides in the world.Â  They were very picturesque with scores of white sheep
contentedly grazing there.Â  On these rolling hills, we could see miles and
miles of stone walls made of slate rock of all sizes and shapes, held together
without mortar.Â  They looked like outlines in a giant puzzle.Â  The walls were
placed there, hundreds of years ago, built by sheep herders to separate their
flocks and to identify their lands.Â  We marveled at them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As we go through life, some of us build a similar rock wall,
as it were, between ourselves and heaven.Â  This wall is usually made up of our
uncorrected mistakes or un-repented sins.Â  For example, in our wall there may
be stones of many different sizes and shapes.Â  There could be stones placed
there because we have been unkind to someone.Â  Criticism of leaders or teachers
may add another stone.Â  A lack of forgiveness of others may place another.Â 
Vulgar thoughts and actions may deposit some rather large rocks in this wall.Â 
You may be sure dishonesty will set one in place, selfishness another, and so
on.Â  If we are not careful this wall will develop into a very formidable
barrier.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In spite of the wall we may have built between us, our
heartfelt cries do get through to him.Â  However, when He sends His messages
back to us, because of the wall we have built, his inspiration often cannot
penetrate our hearts<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>and
we suffer.Â  We may even say, &quot;He doesn't hear,&quot; or &quot;He doesn't
answer,&quot; or &quot;He doesn't really care&quot;.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of our greatest challenges in life is to destroy this
wall<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>stone by stone,
or if you please, to cleanse ourselves, to purify this inner vessel so that we
can be in tune and receive His answers to our petitions for help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We must also keep in mind that often He uses othersÂ  as His
helpers in taking care of our needs and answering our prayers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have found that even at times when a great effort has been
given towards cleansing and purifying this inner vessel, it is still possible
on occasion to be frustrated in our efforts to communicate with heaven.Â  I have
learned much from my study of the Ninth Section of the Doctrine and Covenants.Â 
The Lord's instruction to Oliver Cowdery is so clear as he attempted to
translate the Book of Mormon.Â  Remember what the Lord told him:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&quot;Behold, you have not
understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no
thought save it was to ask me.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that
you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if
it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you
shall feel that it is right.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>But if it be not right you shall
have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause
you to forget the thing which is wrong. . .<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></i>Â  (Doctrine and Covenants 9:7-9)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On more than a few occasions, I have put these instructions
to the test and have had an abundance of positive experiences in the answers I have
received.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However there have been those few times when I have drawn a
complete blank.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On those occasions, it seemed that no matter which side of
an issue I submitted for confirmation, I would get neither a positive nor a
negative feeling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I couldn't figure it out nor understand why.Â  Then some
years ago I received a startling personal revelation.Â  I was reading from one
of President Brigham Young's talks found in the Journal of Discourses.Â  Here
was the answer I had been praying for.Â  It let me know I was not left alone in
my request for help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Quoting from Brigham Young: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&quot;If I ask him to give me wisdom
concerning any requirement in life, or in regard to my own course, or that of
my friends, my children or those that I preside over, and get no answer from
him, and then do the very best that my judgement will teach me, He is bound to
own and honor that transaction, and He will do so to all intents and
purposes.&quot;</i>Â  (Journal of Discourses, 3:205)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So now I think I understand the process better than I did
before.Â  When I have studied it out in my mind and fervently prayed over the
issue and still do not get the positive or negative feeling I'm looking for,
then I just go ahead, using the best judgement my mind and heart can give me
and I have the assurance that the Lord will stand behind and support me in the
decision.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, I would like to tell you some of my feelings about
removing a couple of the larger stones that may be in your wall of spiritual
resistance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I suppose we have all had someone do something to us or say
something to us that we didn't like, and that made us angry.Â  We can't forget
it and we may not even want to forget it.Â  In other words, we are unforgiving.Â 
The Lord has had some very strong words to say to those who will not forgive one
another.Â  Remember those words in the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 64:8-10.Â 
We read:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&quot;My disciples, in days of old,
sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their
hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye
ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his
trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the
greater sin.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>I, the Lord, will forgive whom I
will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many years ago I had one of my experiences in being
unforgiving.Â  I felt I had been taken advantage of, and I did not like the
person.Â  I did not want to be around him.Â  I wouldn't talk to him unless I
absolutely had to.Â  Long after the issue should have been closed, it was still
cankering my soul.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One day my wife, who is very astute and knows how to read
me, said, &quot;You don't like so and so, do you?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;No, I don't,&quot; I said, &quot;but how could you
tell?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Well, your feelings show when you are around him.Â 
It's in your countenance<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>it
shows.Â  Why don't you do something about it?&quot;Â  she asked.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Like what?&quot; I said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Why don't you pray about it?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I said, &quot;Well, I did pray, and I still don't like
him.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;No, &quot; she replied, &quot;why don't you really
pray about it?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I thought, how do you really pray about something?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then I began to think, and I knew what she meant.Â  So I
decided that I was going to pray for a better feeling about this person until I
had one.Â  My spiritual life was on the line.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That night I got on my knees and prayed and tried to open up
my heart to the Lord.Â  But when I got up, I still didn't care for that person.Â 
The next morning I knelt and prayed and tried again to have a feeling of
goodness toward him; but when IÂ  finished, I didn't feel any different.Â  This
process continued for several weeks, with the same negative result.Â  Every
night and every morning I prayed, but finally I noticed that my prayers had
turned to pleadings.Â  I have found that pleading raises prayer to another
level.Â  It happens when you really open up your heart to the Lord and let him
see the real intent and purpose of your petition to him.Â  A petition based on a
deep love for the Lord as well as for each one of his children.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I don't remember a specific time that it happened, but I do
know that the time finally came when I knew that if I were asked to, I could
stand before the Lord and<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>at
least in this instance<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>He
would find that I had a forgiving heart.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The stone of unforgiveness needs to be removed from all of
us.Â  If it happens to be there, I suggest thatÂ  persistent prayer and even
pleading might be a way to remove it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the stones that presents a very real problem for many
is unworthy and unclean thoughts.Â  Many are the stones that are placed in the
wall between us and heaven because of vulgar thoughts and actions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remembering the words of Moroni 10:30 we read:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&quot;And again I would exhort you
that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch
not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing.&quot;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The very devil and the father of all lies, has slyly and
slowly lowered the social norms of morality to a tragic and destructive level.Â 
In magazines and books, on CD's and tapes, on our television, computer and theater
screens is portrayed more and more often a lifestyle that might even rival the
excesses of those who lived in Sodom and Gomorrah.Â  The screens, music, printed
materials, etc., are filled with a profusion of sex, nudity, vulgarity and foul
language.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the great tragedies is that too many of us are
watching and listening to this type of so-called entertainment.Â  Some do it
only casually at first.Â  They think they are spiritually strong and will be
immune to its influence.Â  This trash leads to nothing more nor less than
pornography one of the master deceiver's most effective products.Â  Part of the
tragedy I speak of is that many do not recognize they are trapped or soon will
be.Â  Unfortunately, I fear even some within the sound of my voice have an addiction
and do not realize it.Â  They see this as a form of entertainment that serves as
a relief from the troubles of the day.Â  In point of fact, and in reality, it is
only relieving them of their spirituality and their capacity to draw on the
powers of heaven in times of need.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We must come to understand fully the consequences of having
an appetite for such trash.Â  None of us here today can look at, read about, or
listen to such explicit vulgarity, even in its mildest form, without bringing
sorrow to a loving God and a terrible injury to one's own spirit.Â  We cannot
look at or listen to these unholy depictions without suffering the consequences
and those consequences are very real.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We must remember, our rewards for righteous living are only
partially enjoyed in this mortal life.Â  Likewise, our miseries for breaking the
commandments of God will not all be realized fully as we live here on earth.Â 
Eternity is a long, long time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember, our mind is a wonderful instrument.Â  It will
record and keep whatever we put into it both trash and beauty.Â  When we see or
hear anything filthy or vulgar, whatever the source, our mind records it, and
as it makes the filthy record, beauty and clean thoughts are pushed into the
background.Â  The brightness of hope and faith in Christ begin to fade; and,
more and more, turmoil and discontent become our companions.Â  We are not as
happy as we used to be.Â  We find less peace and contentedness in our hearts and
in our homes.Â  We do things that later we wish we had not done.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, if you have this problem we speak of, if, imbedded in
the wall, are desires or habits that keep heaven-sent messages from entering
your heart, let me give you hope and help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You may need to go to your spouse, your parents or your
bishop for help.Â  Most certainly each of us must go to the Lord.Â  Stopping the
activity and cleansing the spirit of the impurities of which we've been
speaking will not be easy, and it will not be quick; but, it can be sure.Â  I
quote from an article found in the November 1980 Ensign.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&quot;The secret of cleansing the
spirit of impurities is not very complicated.Â  It begins with sincere,
heartfelt prayer every morning and ends with prayer every night.Â  This is the
most important step I know in the process.Â  It may simply be a prayer for strength
to turn from bad habits, or a prayer that sin will be distasteful to you.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&quot;Meanwhile, remember that not
all prayers are answered the same day or even the next day.Â  Sometimes it takes
a long time.Â  But with this step securely in place, hundreds of miracles have
taken place.Â  Without it, there is continued frustration, unhappiness,
ineffectiveness, and despair.Â  If you have tried and have given up, I plead
with you to try again and again and again.Â  Our Heavenly Father will not
forsake your efforts if you sincerely persist.&quot;</i>Â  </p>

</p>
<p align="CENTER"></p>
<p align="CENTER">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement<br />
April 26, 2003<br />
President James E. Faust</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">President Bednar, members of the Board of Trustees, faculty and staff, graduates and parents, as I open my address today, I am reminded of a statement made by Senator Robert Dole to the graduating class at Colby College in Waterville, Maine.  He noted, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Being a commencement speaker is like being a corpse at a funeral.  They need you in order to hold the event, but nobody expects you to say very much.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
  You graduates are anxious to receive your diplomas, and perhaps your parents and families are more so.  You will be relieved to know I have long been of the opinion that speeches do not have to be endless to be eternal.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">As vice chairman of the board of trustees of the Church Board of Education, I express appreciation to Commissioner Hal Eyring for his continued excellent service as Church Commissioner of Education.  I also express appreciation to President Bednar, his associates in administration, and staff and faculty for their inspired leadership in the challenging task of enhancing this institution to a four-year university.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">To have any degree from this university is a singular recognition. BYU-Idaho, along with your sister institution in Provo, are the only universities in the world where the majority of the Board of Trustees are prophets, seers, and revelators.  This ensures that this institution<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s spiritual moorings will be maintained over its life.  Only in this way can we justify the expenditure of millions of dollars of tithing money this institution requires.  This money is <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
impressed with a holy trust.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I know your professors and teachers have tried very hard to prepare you to go forth into the business and professional world.  We appreciate the faculty of this university and hope they are not too happy to see you graduates leave!  We all thank them for their considerable efforts to help you qualify for your degrees.   Parents, wives, husbands, and other family members share in full measure the honor and pride of this day because of their sustaining support. </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">To look into your faces today is inspiring.  You represent well the splendid young people of our Church, and we applaud you.  A few of you, perhaps, may have felt that some of the standards at BYU-Idaho are repressive.  I think President Bednar and his predecessors are trying to tell you that how you look will affect how you think and act.  This is projecting to the future.  It is part of your education.  When you walk down the street, when you sit in councils, when you speak, people will see you as truly enlightened, liberated, and educated individuals.  They will know that you are trying to live above the debasing and confining feelings, thoughts, and actions being merchandised in this finite world. </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I am grateful to see the sisters who are graduating today.  This fulfills what President Brigham Young urged young women to do.  He said: <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
We have sisters here who, if they had the privilege of studying, would make just as good mathematicians or accountants as any man; and we think they ought to have the privilege to study these branches of knowledge that they may develop the powers with which they are endowed.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Today is a day for you and your family to savor.  It is a time of accomplishment, satisfaction, and joy.   Please cherish every moment.  But perhaps in the future, you will take time to reflect  on something I am going to say.  As a child, I recall my father struggling through law school as a disabled veteran of World War I.  He had a wife, who did not work, and three small boys.  We might have gone hungry at times except for the generosity of our grandparents who had a farm.  Some years later, when I was a teenager, I recall my father saying something very sobering.  He thought his graduation from the university would end his troubles, but he learned that the challenges were just beginning.  That has been my experience as well.  The years spent in the university are challenging, but in some ways they are the most rewarding of a lifetime.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Graduation opens up great challenges, opportunities, and blessings far beyond our wildest dreams.  You must continually learn to function and live in this increasingly complex world.  If you are to succeed, you will need to work very hard just to keep up with changes in technology.  You will need to be smart.  You will need to learn wisdom.  As President Hinckley has said to your generation, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
This is an age that requires that you really dig into it and master it.  You cannot just do it halfway.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">I urge you not to be afraid of the future.  Mark Twain said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
I have had a lot of problems in my day . . . most of which never happened.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
  Prepare for the future.  You have the heritage, training, and the faith to make remarkable achievements in the various roles you will play in life.   Obedience to the commandments of God and love and service to others are the grand keys to your happiness here and hereafter.  Upon these <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
hang all the law and the prophets.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">At the commencement of the University of Utah School of Medicine on Friday, May 25, 2002, President Cecil O. Samuelson, former dean of that medical school and vice-president of Health Sciences at the University, and newly appointed President of Brigham Young University,  gave some excellent suggestions to that body in 2002 and I would like to quote some of these in abbreviated form:</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">However, a divine facilitating gift can crown your efforts in any endeavor so that you may reach your profound potential.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">When asked which feature distinguished the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from all others, the Prophet Joseph Smith answered that <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
we differed in mode of baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
   In your learning, in your acquiring, in your progress, in all your labors always live so as to enjoy the compensating gift of the Holy Ghost.  In this way, you can be liberated from the groveling of this world.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Cultivating and seeking the gift of the Holy Ghost in our endeavors is entirely consistent with the direction given by Brigham Young, whose name this institution now memorializes.  This institution has had other names and has memorialized both people and stakes of Zion.  It was first called the Bannock Stake Academy, then was known as the Fremont Academy, and subsequently named Ricks Academy, honoring Thomas E. Ricks, a great pioneer.  Today we further memorialize the name of Thomas E. Ricks by breaking ground for the Thomas E. Ricks Building.  </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Thomas Ricks was with the Saints in Nauvoo and helped build the temple.  During the exodus, some Indians drove off their cattle.  Tom Ricks and others were sent to retrieve the livestock from the Indians.  When they came upon the Indians, Tom was hit with three shots, two came to rest in his kidneys, and the third in his backbone.  Thinking he was dying, his companions left him bleeding on the ground.  An Indian approached and raised his knife to scalp him.  Tom put his arm up to protect his head which unsettled the Indian and he grabbed Tom<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
s gun and left.  </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Later, recounting this to family members he said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
While I lay there weltering in blood, . . . I heard a voice say audibly and clearly, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#62;</font>
You will not die; you will go to the valley of the mountains and there you will do a great work in your day and generation.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
  This was literally fulfilled.  Returning from a mission in Las Vegas, he was sent to help save the Willie and Martin handcart companies.  He went on several missions, helped settle Tooele and Cache County and, at age 55, was called to leave Logan and settle the Rexburg area.  He became bishop of the ward, president of the stake, and founded the Bannock Stake Academy.</p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">At Thomas E. Ricks<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
 funeral, President Joseph F. Smith said, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
It may be a long time before we find another man his equal in honor, mind, and unswerving loyalty to the cause of God and his people.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
  I wish to pay tribute also to the considerable contributions of the descendants of Thomas E. Ricks to this community, this State, and to the Church.  It would be unfair to single out any one person but I have been personally acquainted with the several of them.  To you of the Ricks Family please accept of our thanks and appreciation for all that you have done, are doing, and will do in the future. </p>
<p align="LEFT"></p>
<p align="LEFT">In conclusion, I pray that as graduates of this institution, you will go forth as men and women of honor and loyalty.   May you persist one day at a time.  May you make a lasting contribution in your journey.  May you take your family with you every step of the way.  May you continue with faith in God and his duly called leaders, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">April 26, 2003</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am grateful to be with you on this day when graduates,
families, and faculty are honored.Â  You have my admiration and my thanks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My message is one of hope in a rapidly changing world.Â  I
hear frequently these words, spoken with concern: &quot;Nothing will be the way it was.&quot;Â  It is easy to
overestimate how rapidly and completely things are changing.Â  But one thing is
clear: what you have learned to date won't
be sufficient for the future.Â  Your hope and mine is that you have learned how
to learn.Â  That gift will turn out to be priceless.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The very nature of this university gives me confidence that
you have learned how to learn.Â  All we do here is founded in the restored
Gospel of Jesus Christ.Â  There is in it what might appear as a paradox: God is
an unchangeable God yet His Church is continually changing.Â  Well, it is not a
paradox.Â  It is perfectly logical.Â  The principles by which God works are
eternal.Â  And God reveals to His servants and to His disciples how to apply
those principles to fit changing conditions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, you have been taught to look for principles which will
endure no matter what the conditions and also to plead for the Spirit to help
you know how to apply them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For instance, your teachers in religion classes have taught
you this principle: &quot;wickedness
never was happiness.&quot;<sup>1</sup>Â 
That has always been true and always will be.Â  And you have found the need to
plead for the Holy Ghost to help you apply that principle in a world which has
turned things upside down, branding wickedness as happiness and trying to
convince you that misery is best treated medically rather than by repentance.Â 
It never was easy to apply that principle.Â  But you have been taught that it is
true and how to get the help you will need to apply it in a shifting world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You have had encouragement to learn how to find and apply
lasting principles from all of your teachers.Â  My teachers did that for me.Â 
Long ago I was taught in physics class the laws of motion.Â Â  You remember: To
every force there is an equal and opposite reaction.Â  It was true when Newton
proposed his third law of motion, it was still true after much of the rest of
what I learned in physics was replaced, and it will be true as long as the
world stands.Â  And those teachers gave me more opportunity than I wanted to
learn how to apply the laws of motion.Â Â  The problems I was assigned to work
seem to come back whenever I ride an elevator.Â  I still remember struggling to
solve problems about elevators in motion.Â  It wasn't fun, but it taught me that you only really
learn a principle by using it, over and over again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your political science teacher might have helped you
discover this principle: power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts
absolutely.Â  That's a
principle to ponder when you are in a position of power someday. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of you may go on to be trained in professions.Â  I've asked some great
teachers if there are principles you must learn to serve well in a changing
world.Â  One law professor told me that you should understand the principle of
due process.Â  He said that it means there is a proper way to do things.Â  You
will apply that principle differently in the English legal tradition than you
will in other legal systems. But the understanding of due process and the
ability to apply it will serve you wherever you may practice law.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A great teacher of accounting taught me the principle that I
was to provide my clients timely, accurate, and useful information to make good
decisions.Â  That was true for the clerk who sat on a stool near the cold
fireplace in the office of Ebenezer Scrooge.Â  It will be true in whatever world
of business may be ahead of us, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A great surgeon told me that he taught his students this
principle: collections of infected fluid must be drained thoroughly.Â  He
applied that principle once by leaving a large wound open until it drained.Â 
Your medical school professor will help you learn how to use that principle in
a variety of situations.Â  And you will be ready to be taught because you have
learned here to be eager to discover fundamental principles and have learned to
pay the full price to know how to apply them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your gospel study will give you confidence in that process.Â 
For example, take that maxim from the political science professor:Â  power
corrupts; and absolute power corrupts absolutely.Â  Your Book of Mormon study
taught you about that principle.Â  And so did your class in the Doctrine and
Covenants.Â  You learned that the principle applied exactly to wicked King
Noah.Â  But good King Mosiah and good King Benjamin seemed to escape the
corruption.Â  You learned from the 121<sup>st</sup> section that it is the
nature and disposition of <i>almost</i> all <i>men</i> to exercise unrighteous
dominion.Â  But Heavenly Father and the Savior have power which is absolute.Â 
Yet they are free of corruption.Â  That is because they know eternal principles
perfectly and they are perfectly obedient to them.Â  So, you have learned to
apply the principle as this:Â  "power <i>tends</i> to corrupt."Â 
By living true principles we can exercise power that blesses those we serve and
need not corrupt but can exalt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord ended that 121<sup>st</sup> section with this
principle of promise in the use of power: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&quot;Let
thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of
faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy
confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the
priesthood shall distill upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.&quot;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You have learned in your studies that God works by
unchanging principles. You will find that the search for enduring principles
has become natural to you in every field of study.Â  You have had success
seeking the wisdom to apply principles.Â  You have learned that obedience to the
laws and ordinances of the gospel will bring you the inspiration you will need
to be a learner forever.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Those habits of learning will serve you well wherever you
live, whatever changes come in the future, and whatever service you may give in
the world and in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I bear you my testimony that God lives and that He loves
us.Â  He canÂ  be trusted because He is bound by eternal principles.Â  His beloved
Son is our Savior.Â  Because of His Atonement we will be raised in the
resurrection.Â  And by obedience to His commandments we can have the Holy Ghost
as a companion.Â  With that spirit we can be led to find and apply principles
which endure.Â  The personal standards you have made your own will give you the
right to inspiration.Â  With your capacity to find lasting principles and to use
them wisely, you will make remarkable contributions in your families, in the
Church, and in the world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We send you forth with confidence, with our love, and with
great expectations for your future learning and future service.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The Importance of Small and Simple and Ordinary Things<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
</b></i>
</p>
<p align="CENTER"></p>
<p align="CENTER">Brigham Young University-Idaho Commencement<br />
April 26, 2003<br />
President David A. Bednar</p>
<p>This is a day you graduates have looked forward to with anticipation and excitement for a long time.  I hope each of you has a genuine sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.   Sister Bednar and I extend to you our congratulations and our love.</p>
<p>On this memorable and momentous occasion, I want to talk with you briefly about the importance of small and simple and ordinary things.  Let me simply suggest that ordinary people who consistently and diligently do simple things will produce extraordinary results.  This inspired and inspiring pattern of work and achievement is described many times in the scriptures.</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon, Nephi describes the Liahona and how it guided the course of Lehi and his family in the wilderness.  In verses 28 and 29 of 1 Nephi 16 we read:</p>
<p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which were in the ball, that they did work according to the faith and diligence and heed which we did give unto them.</p>
<p>And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was plain to be read, which did give us understanding concerning the ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it.  And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things.  (emphasis added)</p>
<p>In Alma 37 in the Book of Mormon, Alma explained to his son Helaman the seemingly small and simple ways by which the holy scriptures are preserved from generation to generation.  In verses six and seven he summarized:</p>
<p>Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.</p>
<p>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.  (emphasis added)</p>
<p>And in Doctrine and Covenants 64:32-33 we are instructed:</p>
<p>But all things must come to pass in their time.</p>
<p>Wherefore, be not weary in well doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.  And out of small things proceedeth that which is great. (emphasis added).</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, performance and accomplishment are rarely the result of gigantic and dramatic efforts expended in a relatively short period of time.  Rather, incremental, gradual, consistent, and persistent work and improvement lead to effective performance and satisfying accomplishment.</p>
<p>In the Church we often refer to the impact in our lives of a message from a General Authority or the work of an inspired stake president or ward Relief Society president.  May I suggest, however, that the great work of the Church is accomplished by humble and ordinary visiting and home teachers<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#67;</font>
men and women who are hardly ever acknowledged or recognized.   I am acquainted with a woman who has been a faithful visiting teacher throughout her life.  She is consistent, persistent, and unwavering in her service.  On one occasion this good sister was told by a woman she had served for many years as a visiting teacher, <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
I and my family are active in the Church today because of you.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
  This visiting teacher frankly was shocked to hear such a statement.  She had often wondered if she was doing any good or meeting the needs of the women she served.  But her steady and consistent and simple and ordinary service provided the necessary spiritual life preserver that helped to save a sister in need.  There was nothing flashy, nothing speedy, and nothing overpowering about her visiting teaching.   But the accumulation of small and simple and ordinary deeds and expressions of faith and love and testimony indeed produced something that was great. </p>
<p>I believe many of us tend to overlook the importance of small and simple and ordinary things.  Perhaps we believe in a <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
big bang<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 theory of accomplishment<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#67;</font>
that true success grows out of a superhuman effort expended swiftly just before a deadline.  And perhaps we <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
miss the mark<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
 and overlook small and simple and ordinary things because we expect our lives to be a continuous stream of exhilarating events and unending progress.  I find great comfort in the following citation used by President Gordon B. Hinckley:</p>
<p>I have enjoyed these words of Jenkins Lloyd Jones, which I clipped from the newspaper some years ago.  Said he:</p>
<p>[The fact is] most putts don<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#61;</font>
t drop.  Most beef is tough.  Most children grow up to be just people.  Most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration.  Most jobs are more often dull than otherwise . . . .</p>
<p>Life is like an old-time rail journey<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#67;</font>
delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of speed.</p>
<p>The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride.  (<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
Big Rock Candy Mountains,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
<u>Deseret News</u>, 12 June 1973, A4 as cited in <font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#65;</font>
A Conversation with Single Adults,<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#64;</font>
<u>Ensign</u>, March 1997, p. 60)</p>
<p>I know many successful individuals who attribute their career achievement in education, or in the professions, or in the trades to steady, sustained, consistent, and nondazzling work.   As we were taught by President Hinckley last October:</p>
<p>There is no end in sight for the good you can do.  Do you know it?  You are just simple kids.  You are not geniuses. I know that.  But the work of the world isn't done by geniuses. It is done by ordinary people who have learned to work in an extraordinary way<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#67;</font>
people of your kind who can do these things.  (Remarks at the dedication of the Gordon B. Hinckley Building, Brigham Young University-Idaho, October 22, 2002)</p>
<p>Let me suggest that many, if not all, of your most satisfying and memorable accomplishments in your home, in the Church, in your work, and in your community will be the result of simple and small and ordinary things.</p>
<p>As we reflect upon our roles and goals and responsibilities and challenges, may we all recall the imagery suggested in section 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p>You know, brethren, that a very large ship is benefited very much by a very small helm in the time of a storm, by being kept workways with the wind and the waves.</p>
<p>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.  (Doctrine and Covenants 123:16-17)</p>
<p>Now, I would like to conclude on a personal note.  Sister Bednar and I love you.  We have so much enjoyed visiting with you on campus and in your apartments, participating with you in home evenings, talking about your challenges and opportunities, answering your questions, and becoming better acquainted.  We will miss you.  And we would love to hear from you<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#67;</font>
please be sure to let us know about the things that are happening in your lives.</p>
<p>Today you graduates become official alumni of BYU-Idaho, and you now have the responsibility to help the world better understand who we are and what we do at Brigham Young University-Idaho.  You have been called to assist in fulfilling the prophecies about this remarkable institution.  How you live, what you do, and what you become will ultimately define this university.  May the Lord bless you as you always remember Him and serve Him with faith and diligence.</p>
<p>As our sons have left our home for college and on missions, Sister Bednar and I have shared with them the following counsel:</p>
<p><font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#36;</font> &#9;Remember that you represent the Savior.</p>
<p><font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#36;</font> &#9;Remember that you represent your family. </p>
<p><font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#36;</font> &#9;Remember that you represent The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>And as you now are leaving Brigham Young University-Idaho, may I add one more item to the list?</p>
<p><font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&#36;</font> &#9;Remember that you represent Brigham Young University-Idaho.</p>
<p>I bear my testimony and declare my witness that God lives.  I know that Jesus is the Christ.  And I testify that the fullness of the gospel has been restored to the earth in these latter days.  I further testify that, as graduates of this institution, you have a responsibility to build the kingdom of God on the earth; I know that you will do so with faith and with diligence.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When I was
sixteen years old I remember returning home early one evening from a social
activity, very much awake and not ready to go to bed.Â  I thought of going
outside to bounce the basketball but knew that the neighbors would not
appreciate this activity, as they probably <i>were</i> in bed.Â  I also thought
I might play some music on my phonograph but knew my parents would object to
this as their bedroom was below mine!Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Lying on my bed
stand was a copy of the Book of Mormon that my mother always placed there in
the hope that I would read it.Â  At that time, I had read <i>in</i> the Book of
Mormon but had not really <i>read</i> the Book of Mormon.Â  Indeed, the only
phrase I certainly remembered from the book was, </span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I,
Nephi, having been born of goodly parents.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Â  That evening, having not much motive
beyond having nothing better to do, I began to read the Book of Mormon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The next morning
at 11:00 a.m., being Saturday, my parents thought I was sleeping in as I did
not have to be at work until that afternoon.Â  I was, however, very much awake.Â 
I was reading the concluding words of Moroni, </span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yea,
come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourself of all
ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourself of all ungodliness, and love God
with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you...</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>(<i>Moroni 10:32</i>).Â  After having read the concluding
invitation and farewell from Moroni, I knelt by my bed and put to the test the
promise he made earlier: </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And when ye shall receive these things, I
would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of
Christ if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart,
with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto
you, by the power of the Holy Ghost</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> (<i>Moroni 10:4</i>).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That Saturday
morning I asked for the witness of the Holy Ghost, and I received it more
clearly and powerfully than any experimental conclusion or rational deduction
that I have ever made.Â  It became the foundation from which the most important
convictions arose.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The following
Monday morning at school, I met a good friend, not a member of the Church, with
whom I had many discussions about the gospel.Â  He said to me that he had a list
of 50 anachronisms in the Book of Mormon that demonstrated that the Book of
Mormon is not based upon a ancient text but was a nineteenth century
invention.Â Â  (An anachronism refers to a person or event or thing that is
chronologically out of place, a bit like saying that Julius Caesar drove his
SUV into Rome.)Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well, I told my
friend that he was too late, for I had a certain witness of the Book of
Mormon!Â  But, I said to him, </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Give me your list and I will keep it.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Â  I did keep that list and over the years, and as more
research and study were done by various analysts and academics, one item after
the other dropped off the list.Â Â  Finally, a few years ago, I was speaking to a
group at Cornell University and mentioned my list and noted that after these
many years only one item remained - but I could wait.Â  After my presentation, a
distinguished professor came up to me and said, </span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
you can remove your last item, for our studies indicate that it is not an
anachronism.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Think for a
minute what my life would have been like had I withheld my conviction of the
Book of Mormon until I had resolved all the questions that my friend had given
me.Â  I have often said that, when it comes to the most fundamental truths, I
have no doubts, although I may have some questions!Â  There are some things for
which we must have a certitude that transcends our incomplete understanding and
immediate questions.Â  Moroni pointed the way to receive real knowledge both of
the most fundamental questions and the most sublime truths.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On January 11,
2003, in the First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, President Boyd K.
Packer of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles called upon our leaders to </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>measure everything you learn about your ordination and
calling against fundamental truths</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> and outlined those truths.Â  Among them
are the divine mission of Jesus Christ and the Church He established; the loss
of the precious truths of the gospel, the changing of the ordinances, and the
loss of the apostolic keys in the Apostasy; the Restoration under the direction
of the Father and the Son and through the Prophet Joseph Smith of that which
had been lost; and the persistence of the apostolic and priesthood keys in the
Church today. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>President Packer
pointed to the Holy Ghost as the sextant that each individual receives at
baptism in order to discern and establish in our lives these truths.Â  Elder
Neal A. Maxwell, also of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, similarly addressed
our responsibility to receive personal revelation that each of us may have a
sure witness of those most fundamental truths.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What exactly <i>is
</i>the nature of the truth of revelation and the witness of the Spirit?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>FROM INFORMATION TO KNOWLEDGE</span></i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We are said to
be in the midst of an information revolution</span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>computers;
information storage, analysis, and retrieval systems; networks; artificial
intelligence; communication satellites; television and telephone systems.Â 
Though we are inundated with information, many are drowning in ignorance.Â 
Indeed, even within the context of this great secular revolution, a key issue
is how we translate information into knowledge</span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>how
we fit the bits and pieces, the data, into suchÂ  patterns that we can actually
say that we know something.Â  Once having integrated information into knowledge,
how do we know that <i>what</i> we know is accurate or complete?Â  Scientist and
philosophers alike agree that, in a fundamental sense, we don't.Â  All empirical
knowledge is provisional, subject to further information and different
interpretive models.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sometimes,
however, we confuse our provisional knowledge with the things known.Â  In a
headline in the <i>New York Times</i>, it read &quot;Mass Found in Elusive
Particle; Universe May Never Be the Same&quot; (5 June 1998).Â  The article
suggested that now that scientists know that neutrinos have mass, this will
slow the expansion of the universe.Â  Somehow I think the universe is the same
today as it was the day before the scientific communityÂ  revised its theories!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is possible,
therefore, to know without knowing.Â  In fact, it is written that in the Council
in Heaven, Satan, who certainly had lots of information, &quot;knew not the
mind of God...wherefore he sought to destroy the world&quot; (<i>Moses 4:6</i>).Â 
Paul spoke of those who are &quot;ever learning, and never able to come to the
knowledge of the truth&quot; (<i>2 Timothy 3:7</i>).Â  Amos predicted that in
our day there would be a famine of knowledge, and Moroni spoke of a veil of
unbelief that causes men to remain in the blindness of their minds (<i>Ether
4:15</i>).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On the other
hand, the Lord has commanded that we serve him with all our minds (<i>Doctrine
and Covenants 4:20</i>) and that we seek learning by study and by faith (<i>Doctrine
and Covenants 88:118</i>).Â  He has counseled us to search after knowledge of
countries and of kingdoms, of history and of nature, of things past, of things

it is a fearful thing to deny the witness of the Holy Ghost?Â  Unlike other

certitude unknown in any other area of thought.Â  There may be many
philosophical demonstrations relative to the existence of God or the divine

the arena of speculation, no matter how convincing. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once one has
sought and received the witness of the Holy Ghost, one assumes a life-changing

<p class="MsoNormal">The mall on the Potomac was dark and shadowy and the Viet

<p class="MsoNormal">Finding myself standing alone, I thumbed through the columns

Personal items such as books, pictures, frozen flowers, clothing, lockets,
letters, mementoes, and other items were tenderly placed in front of every
panel.Â  Ken had been a dear boyhood friend who like you attended BYUÂ–Idaho.Â  He
was obedient to the Lord in his youth, followed the commandments, went on a
mission, had plans for education and a family, but Ken died prematurely on the
jungle floor of Viet Nam.Â  As I ran my finger down the cold black marble wall I

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There also appears to be a <b>GEOGRAPHICAL</b> dimension to
Standing in Holy Places.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a young boy growing up in Firth, Idaho, population 292
and dropping, I approached my eighth birthday wondering about the boy prophet
and the hardships he faced at such a tender age.Â  I knelt on the banks of the
Blackfoot canal and prayed about the first vision and to my surprise no
startling revelation occurred.Â  Our church was a very old red brick building
with no air conditioning but large cottonwood trees in back for shade.Â  The
kitchen was our Sunday School classroom and because of limited space the boys
sat on the kitchen counter with the girls in front on a row of chairs.Â  On a
spring Sunday I sat squirming behind Janette Lyons and probably after pulling her
pigtail I was struck by a clear and powerful feeling.Â  I recognized this
feeling as an answer to my former prayer.Â  In essence, I knew from that time
forth that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and he had knelt in a sacred and
holy place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Years later, as I approached the Sacred Grove for my first
visit, the words of our sacred hymn flashed through my mind.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Oh, how lovely was the morning!Â  Radiant beamed the sun
above.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Bees were humming, sweet birds singing,Â  Music ringing
thru the grove,</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>When within the shady woodland Joseph sought the God of
love,..</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Humbly kneeling, sweet appealing<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C&gt;</span>Twas the boy<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s first uttered prayer<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>Â Â  When the powers of sin
assailingÂ  Filled his soul with deep despair;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>But undaunted, still he trusted In his Heavenly Father<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s care,..</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Suddenly a light descended,Â  Brighter far than noon day sun,</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>And a shining glorious pillarÂ  O<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>er him fell, around him
shone,</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>While appeared two heavenly beings,Â  God the Father and

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Joseph,

Oh, how sweet the word!</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Joseph<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
humble prayer was answered,Â  And he listened to the Lord.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Oh, what rapture filled his bosom,Â  For he saw the living
God...(Hymns, no 26)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Sacred Grove is one of the most sacred and holy places
on the earth today.Â  We are also reverent as we visit and think of the Hill
Cumorah, the Whitmer farm and the Three Witnesses, and Father Johnson<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s Farm in Ohio.Â  We are
humble as we approach the banks of the Susquehanna near Harmony and stand near
the Prophet and Emma<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
home site where much of the Book of Mormon was translated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Oliver Cowdery describes these events thus: <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>These were days never to be
forgotten<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>to sit under
the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven...day after
day...uninterrupted, to write from his mouth, as he translated...<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  (<u>Joseph Smith History</u>,
p. 58).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>TEMPLES</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other obvious holy places are the temples.Â  As soon as we
enter the house of the Lord the atmosphere changes from the worldly to the
spiritual.Â  There is a calm and tranquil feeling that permeates our being.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We go to the temple to perform ordinances, be sealed
together for time and all eternity, and do the work for the dead who have not
had the same opportunities that you and I have had. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord specifically
designated Independence as <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>AY</span>the
center place; and a spot for the temple is lying westward, upon a lot which is
not far from the courthouse<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
(Doctrine and Covenants 57:3).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On December 27, 1832, the Prophet Joseph Smith received a
commandment to <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>establish
a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a
house of glory, a house of order, a house of God<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
(Doctrine and Covenants 88:119).Â  In a subsequent revelation he was instructed
to build the Kirtland Temple, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>after
the manner which I shall show unto three of you<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
(Doctrine and Covenants 95:14), meaning the First Presidency. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Probably no other place was as sacred to the early Saints as
the Kirtland Temple.Â  The Saints were in a state of poverty and distress and,
with enemies raging and threatening destruction, it appeared impossible to
build the Temple.Â  The faithful Saints sacrificed and worked despite poverty
and tribulation.Â  On April 3, 1836, Joseph and Oliver <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>AY</span>saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of
the pulpit<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y</span>and under
His feet was a paved work of pure gold in color like amber.Â  His eyes were as a
flame of fire; the hair of His head was white like the pure snow, His
countenance shone above the brightness of the sun, and His voice was as the
sound of the rushing of great waters<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y@</span>
(<u>Joseph Smith<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
Kirtland,</u> Deseret Book Company, pp. 110-111).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On that same day, the Prophet Elijah appeared fulfilling
Malachi<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s prediction.Â 
President Joseph Fielding Smith explained, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>It
was, I am informed, on the third day of April, 1836, that the Jews, in their
homes at the Paschal feast, opened their doors for Elijah to enter.Â  On that
very day Elijah did enter<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>not
in the home of the Jews to partake of the Passover with them<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>but he appeared in the
house of the Lord, erected to his name and received by the Lord in Kirtland,
and there bestowed his keys to bring to pass the very things for which these
Jews, assembled in their homes, were seeking<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
(<u>Doctrines of Salvation</u>, 2:100-101).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord required the Saints of Nauvoo the Beautiful <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>to build a house unto<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y</span>me<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y</span>And ye shall build it on the place where you
have contemplated building it, for that is the spot which I have chosen for you
to built it<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> (Doctrine

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On July 28, 1847, four days after the arrival of the
Pioneers, President Brigham Young, while walking over the ground with some of
his associates, suddenly stopped, and striking the point of his cane into the
parched soil, exclaimed, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Here
we will build the Temple of our God<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
(<u>Temples of the Most High</u>, Bookcraft, Inc. p.128-129).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Historically, when temples were not available, mountains or
other designated geographical areas have been used by the Lord to communicate
with his children.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>And
the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top to the mount: and the Lord
called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> (Exodus 19: 20).Â  Here, the Lord gave the Ten Commandments to the children of Israel through
Moses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Brother of Jared carried stones up into Mount Shelem and
saw the finger of the Lord because of his great faith. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In our dispensation, President Brigham Young attested to
endowment ceremonies on the summit of Ensign Peak near Salt Lake City, thus
giving a new sanctity to the prominent peak (<u>History of the Church</u>, Vol.
3, p. 386).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you personally bring the sacred and the temple into your
individual lives, BYU-Idaho, resting on the side of the Rexburg Hill, will
become a more holy and sacred place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Additionally, there is another holy place where we should go
each week and partake of the Sacrament and be taught the gospel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>FAMILY</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The family is also a critical dimension of holy places,
which should be considered.Â  We should be Standing in a Holy Place when we
stand in our own home.Â  Our home today might be an apartment on campus or an
apartment off campus.Â  If we are prayerful in teaching our children or our
roommates that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, that Jesus Christ is our
Savior and our Father in Heaven lives, our homes can become be a holy place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There will always be some challenges in our homes, but as
Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>If
we wish to make our efforts count in meeting the vexing challenges of our time,
the ecology of our effectiveness suggests of the home that truly <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>&gt;</span>this is the place.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the mid-seventies our family moved to Boise, Idaho, where
my parents were living.Â  Cindy and I were grown adults with four kids.Â  After
several months passed, Dad started calling frequently and emphatically stating
he was low on firewood and wanted me to go with him to the Sawtooth Mountains
to replenish his supply.Â  I did not particularly want to cut firewood because
Dad already had a year<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
supply, but he was very insistent and always in a hurry.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Pick me up at 5:00 a.m. on the dot, we have a lot of firewood to gather and not very much time.Â  We have
a lot to do and little time.Â  Don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
be late.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  He also
mentioned more than once, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Son
you can never have too much firewood.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ten minutes into the trip, or passing Lucky Peak Dam, which
ever occurred first, he would religiously say, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Son,
why are you driving so fast?Â  You are hurrying too much.Â  You need to slow down
and relax.Â  The world won<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
end if we don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t get
fire wood.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  After my
protest ended he would say, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Pull
off at Banner Summit, I made a big lunch.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
He would then start talking about every imaginable topic<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>shoeing horses, the demise of the Yankees,
politics, religion, but mostly we talked about the family and whether I was
being a good father and husband.Â  For many years it never occurred to me that,
as an adult, I was being taught and instructed gently on how to improve our
family relations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During these wood-gathering trips over many years we had
Family Home Evening, Family Council, Fathers Interviews and Father<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s Blessings and Dad did it
in a way that I didn<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
even know it was happening.Â  It was never about firewood, it was always about
family.Â  Dad died in May of 1988 and at the time Mom had twenty cords of
firewood. (William Max Snow and Rhea Marriott Snow)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For several years we tried to develop a three or four word
phrase that we felt best described our family mission statement.Â  After
numerous attempts, failures and revisions we concluded with <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Circle at the Summit.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  This statement has given
us great direction and meaning.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Circle
At The Summit,<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> is an
attempt to keep our family compass pointed in the right direction.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The word <i>circle</i> contemplates endless and eternal
circles, family and temple prayer circles, temple marriage, circling the wagons
for safety and a plethora of other meanings.Â  The word <i>summit</i> has the
connotation of pointing the way to God, temples, and visions, and to ascend,
which requires team work, planning, preparation, mapping for those to come, and
much more.Â  The ramifications are seemingly endless.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">No matter the outcome, the effort put forth to preserve the
family will be rewarded.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Lee said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Remember

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>PERSONAL DIMENSION</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to a geographical dimension of Standing in Holy
Places, there is also a personal dimension.Â  It seems clear that Standing in
Holy Places has less to do with <u>where</u> we live and more to do with <u>how</u>
we live.Â  We, as our Savior<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
disciples, cannot Stand in Holy Places if we are not holy ourselves. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to enumerate three elements of the personal
dimension of Standing in Holy Places: sacrifice, obedience and the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, sacrifice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>SACRIFICE</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A core trait of those who Stand in Holy Places seems to be
sacrifice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Dennis B. Neuenschwander teaches, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>The words <i>sacred</i> and
<i>sacrifice</i> come from the same root.Â  One may not have the sacred without

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The daybreak of July 21, 1879, became a fateful day in the
lives of Elder Joseph Standing and his missionary companion, Elder Rudger
Clawson.Â  As a missionary serving in Northern Georgia, Elder Standing had been
harassed, threatened, abused and chased by hooded mobs in the vicinity of
Varnell Landing near the Tennessee border.Â  As the missionaries were walking
through the thick pine and cedar forest surrounding them, they came face to
face with the mob which was in pursuit of them.Â  There were twelve mobbers,
three on horseback, and the rest on foot; a ragged lot, all armed with pistols
or rifles.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Elders asked by what authority they were being held and
the leader replied, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>There<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s no law in Georgia for
Mormons.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  The mob
told them they were going to be whipped and then they would understand the
laying on of hands.Â  The threat of whipping most frightened Joseph.Â  Victims
were stripped, tied face down on a fallen log, and lashed with willow branches
until their backs were bloody.Â  The fear of this beating and impending death
caused the missionaries to become pale and shake.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They were led deeper and deeper into the secluded forest to
a spring.Â  Elder Standing made a bold move to seize a revolver. Â Instantly, one
of the assassins raised his gun to the Elder<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
head and fired.Â  At that critical point the leading mobber pointed at Elder
Clawson and said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Shoot
that man.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  Every
weapon was leveled at his head.Â  He realized there was no avenue of escape.Â 
His time had come to follow his companion Elder Standing to the grave.Â  He
folded his arms, looked at his assailants, and said <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Shoot.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
For whatever unknown reason one of the mobbers said, <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
shoot<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> and one by one
the guns were lowered.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Not yet knowing if he to was to be murdered, he told the mob
he was going for help and turning his back he walked slowly into the woods.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That night by flickering candle light, he carefully wiped
and washed the blood from Elder Standing<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
body in preparation for the long train ride back to Salt Lake City (David S.
Hopes and Roy Hoopes, <u>The Making of a Mormon Apostle: The Story of Rudger
Clawson,</u> New York: Madison Books, 1990, pp. 21-31).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Standing made the ultimate sacrifice that day and
later his companion Elder Clawson served forty-five years as a member of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.Â  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As you walk through the Northern Georgia woods to the
spring, which still flows today, you realize <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>There

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The notion of sacrifice permeates our senses as we stand at
Haun<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s Mill and recall
the nine-year-old Sardius Smith, son of Warren Smith, who earlier in the day
played on the banks of Shoal Creek. </p>

Willie and Martin handcart companies at Rocky Ridge, Rock Creek Hollow, Veil
Crossing and Martin<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Painfully, and with a broken heart, we remember the <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>&gt;</span>extermination order<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span> of Governor Boggs: death
and the threat of death, plundering, burning and premeditated theft of sacred
homes and property, and thousands of banished and innocent men, women, and
children walking, some barefoot, through snow and the brutal cold of a Missouri
winter, only to face crossing the Mississippi River at the Illinois border.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We solemnly and reverently reflect on the illegal sacrifices
at Carthage Jail where the boy prophet sealed his mission and works with his
own blood as did his beloved brother and others.Â  <span style='font-family:

they were not separated<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It has been said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Only
if you sacrifice for a cause will you love it<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y</span>As
noted in our sacred hymn, sacrifice does bring forth the blessings of heaven<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y</span>Let us take this principle
a step further.Â  Could this law of life perhaps explain, in some small way, why
the Savior loves us so much?Â  Is his infinite and unconditional love somehow
tied to His infinite and unconditional sacrifice?Â  His sacrifice was so great
as to be incomprehensible to us.Â  And in atoning for our sins in the shedding
of His blood, He demonstrated a love for us that knows no bounds.Â  Let us
follow the Savior<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
example in sacrificing and loving.Â  Let us sacrifice for each other for the
gospel and for great causes.Â  Then will our love grow commensurately<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> (<i>Church Ne</i>ws,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>OBEDIENCE</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another aspect of Standing in Holy Places is obedience.Â  If
sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven as noted in our sacred hymn,
then each of us must be obedient if we are to follow the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s admonition to be His
disciples and to Stand in Holy Places and not be moved.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In regard to obedience, I think we are off to a good start
today.Â  I have observed that your President has asked each of you to bring your
scriptures to devotionals and you have done so; so did I. (Hold up the
scriptures)Â  Therefore, we are off to a good start.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">President Hinckley has said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y</span>believe that God will
always make a way where there is no way.Â  I believe that if we will walk in
obedience to the commandments of God, if we will follow the counsel of the
priesthood, he will open a way even where there appears to be no way<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> (<span style='font-family:

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a recent stake conference, Elder Lance Wickman, speaking
on this subject, told an experience he had as a young soldier in Hawaii.Â  His
battalion had just been given a new commander who had seen many soldiers die
because of poor attention to details.Â  After a week of stiff training, the
commander came to Elder Wickman<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
company, ordering them to set up a defensive position while other companies
were dismissed.Â  Not only did the soldiers resent this, but digging foxholes in
volcanic rock was almost impossible and seemingly unnecessary.Â  When the
commander came to inspect, he looked at the small rock outlines where foxholes
should have been. <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>What<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s that?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> he asked. <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Sir, that<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s a simulated foxhole.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>A simulated foxhole.Â  What good will a
simulated foxhole do you?Â  You will not be dismissed until you have dug
foxholes according to the book.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
For several hours they chipped away at the volcanic rock, speaking
disparagingly of the commander but finally finished and were dismissed, well
trained.Â  Landing on a Viet Nam beach late in the evening with another company,
they decided to dig their foxholes while the other company decided to wait
until morning.Â  That night enemy fire was taken, and while others suffered
heavy damage, Elder Wickman<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
company did not.Â  The next morning nobody had any disparaging remarks to say
about the commander.Â  Elder Wickman taught that in our own lives we must be
careful not to rely on simulated foxholes. We need to prepare and to be
diligently obedient. (Utah Edgemont Stake Conference, March 2003)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">President Hinckley continues, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>The
prophet Elijah warned King Ahab of drought and famine to come upon the land.Â

<p class="MsoNormal">It is not always easy to be obedient to the voice of the
Lord.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>And Moses said
unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent...but I am slow of speech, and of a
slow tongue.Â  And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s mouth?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y</span>Now therefore go, and I

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>HOLY GHOST</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, I would like to briefly discuss the Holy Ghost as
an element of Standing in Holy Places. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If we live worthy of the constant companionship of the Holy
Ghost we will be guided, directed, and taught to Stand in Holy Places whether
we are alone, with friends, strangers or associates, or in a crowd.Â  Indeed, if
we stand with the Holy Ghost we will be in a holy place and that is the place
the Saints should not be removed from until the day the Lord comes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Regardless of what is going on around us, we can create an
environment filled with the presence of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Heavy rains had been falling for several days prior to September 11, 1990.Â  On this day the Han River began to overflow its banks flooding most
areas in the Korea Seoul West Mission. The situation was extremely dangerous.Â 
Dikes had broken leaving thousands homeless. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the mission secured we got to bed about midnight.Â  At
2:00 a.m. the telephone rang and a voice in clear English said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>President Snow, two of your
missionaries are dead on the north side (Seoul Mission side) of the Pampo
Bridge.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  The
telephone then clicked off.Â  Earlier the 8<sup>th</sup> Army news (AFKN)
reported several deaths near bridges and the Pampo Bridge was deathly hazardous
to cross.Â  Who could the voice be?Â  It seemed to resemble someone who might be
acquainted with the Church vocabulary.Â  In any event, I rose quickly, dressed
and told Cindy I had a distinct feeling I would not return alive.Â  After a
difficult goodbye, I ran for the car but on touching the car door handle, I had
a strong feeling almost physical in nature and not describable by words.Â  A
clear voice in my mind told me to stop and call President Shin of the Seoul
Mission. I listened, made the call and he told me not to attempt to cross the
bridge and after prayer, I agreed.Â  The most comforting calm came across my
mind.Â  Morning revealed no deaths to missionaries and the telephone voice is
unknown to this day. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If we are worthy to have the Holy Ghost be our constant
companion we will not only bless ourselves but we will bless others also.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On Saturday, June 5, 1976, the Teton Dam breached forming a
tidal wave that raged over the Upper Snake River Valley Plain.Â  The small
communities of Wilford and Sugar City were totally devastated.Â  Rexburg and
several other communities downstream received extensive destruction.Â  Homes and
buildings were torn from their foundations, trees toppled, rich dark farmland
was superimposed with boulders, silt, and debris, and business houses were
annihilated.Â  The inundated counties were declared a national disaster area.Â 
Of noticeable effect on the communities was the massive relief program of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Â  Ricks College, a small
church-owned school, provided thousands of victims shelter, clothing, and
medical assistance.Â  30,000 meals a day were served at the peak of the disaster
(Sonderegger v., US Department of the Interior, 424 F. Supp. 847).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Several months later in a judge<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s chamber after all the evidentiary hearings
were completed Judge Marion Callister was sitting under his favorite painting
of George Washington kneeling in prayer by his horse. Judge Callister was a
prayerful man.Â  After lengthy meditation and long silence, Judge Callister
spoke in a very soft voice saying he knew how the case should come out.Â  After
a couple more sentences it became crystal clear in my mind how the opinion
should read.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Federal District Court held that some personal
information from claims filed by the victims of the failure of the Teton Dam
was exempt from disclosure.Â  This decision prevented potential divisiveness,
gossip, innuendo, accusation, defense of integrity for every individual, every
family, every neighborhood, every village, every city, and every county
affected by the failure of the Teton Dam.Â  Many of those affected are in
attendance at this devotional today and have never heard of this court
decision, which personally affected each of them.Â  Judge Marion Callister was a
great God-fearing man who lived by listening to the Spirit.Â  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The greatest example of all we have talked about today is
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.Â  As we stand together with our Savior we are
in holy places.Â  Few of us can comprehend the total impact of Gethsemane or
Golgotha.Â  Those who have the spirit and are striving to Stand in Holy Places
are quieted with the words from our hymn:</p>

be sung this afternoon. In my mind, it best embodies the ideas and principles I
wish to discuss with you today. You will remember that the prophet Joseph
Smith, on the afternoon of his death at the hands of a blood-thirsty mob,
requested John Taylor sing this hymn, not once, but twice.Â  The message, so
beautifully contained therein, certainly must have had a calming and reassuring
effect on Joseph and those friends assembled with him in that upper room of the

this particular hymn has an additional meaning to my children, one of whom has
just helped calm my nerves as she sang today.Â  You see their great-great-great
grandfather was with the prophet in that second-story room on that fateful day
in June of 1844.Â  He, too, listened to the message of this hymn, undoubtedly
pondered its meaning, and would certainly have shared in the heavenly comfort
extended to this quartet of faithful disciples as John Taylor sang of the
seemingly unnoticed, unheralded, and unselfish acts of love shown to aÂ  </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:

you, even as I am</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></i><span style="font-family:Times"> (3 Nephi 27:27).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">May I share with you some
stories, some that I have personally witnessed on this campus and others from
the pages of scripture, that help me better understand what this Christ-like
love, or charity as the scriptures calls it, looks like.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">My fervent prayer today is
that as we listen and reflect on these stories, the Spirit of the Lord will
whisper, to both you and me, what each of us must do to more fully understand
and develop this Christ-like attribute of charity.Â  What you feel, the personal
impressions you may receive while we are together, will be of far more worth
and importance than anything I will say.Â  In such a case, we will have both
been edified and taught by the Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Brothers and sisters, if you
will act on any such impressions you receive, I witness to you, that you will
become more like He whom we are striving to emulate, even the Lord Jesus
Christ.Â  As President Bednar has taught us so often at this university: our
faith grows, our spirituality deepens, and our understanding of gospel
principles is enhanced when we receive, recognize and respond to the promptings
of the Holy Ghost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Many years ago, I had the
blessing of being called to serve in the bishopric of one of the marrieds wards
on campus.Â  I use the term </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:Times">blessing</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style="font-family:Times"> only in hindsight, for upon receiving the call,
having served previously in another campus bishopric, I knew firsthand of the
spiritual strength, dedication and abilities of so many of the young men and
women here. I confess that I was somewhat reluctant to leave my home ward and
family once again. I was at the time teaching fourteen Primary Blazers and I
loved that experience.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Surely there were more than
enough worthy and qualified students in the ward itself to fill this position.Â 
Most, if not all, were returned missionaries, many of whom had served as branch
presidents the world over. Many of these young men would make excellent
counselors to this good man who had been called as their bishop; and I told him
so. Surely, they didn</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times">t need me for this calling.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Well, I was right.Â  They didn</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:
Times">t need me, but as I accepted this calling from the Lord, I came to find
out that I needed them. I needed to learn from the strength of these valiant
ward members, to learn from their dedication, and specifically to learn from
their example of Christ-like love for each other.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">I witnessed so many acts of
selfless love in this student ward.Â  You see, the interaction of ward members
can change rather dramatically once the almost unavoidable, self-serving
motivation of church activity to </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:Times">check out</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style="font-family:Times"> members of the Priesthood or Relief Society as
potential dates has been removed.Â  Not that this student-ward phenomenon is all
bad, but if left unchecked, it can sometimes get in the way of the real reason
for church activity: to worship God and learn how to become more like Him; to
learn how to love and serve others as He did; to learn to sacrifice for others
as He did.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">After about a year in this
calling, I would witness such an act of selfless sacrifice that it continues to
affect me to this day.Â  At the beginning of our second year as a bishopric, our
bishop underwent a rather extensive surgery that left him hospitalized and then
homebound for several months.Â  For those months, as the first counselor, I had
the weighty and truly daunting responsibility of functioning as the </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:
Times">acting</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style="font-family:Times"> bishop in his absence.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Ask any counselor, in any
bishopric, in any ward how he feels when the bishop is out-of-town.Â  I</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:
Times">m sure thoughts such as </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:Times">please don</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times">t let anybody die or get arrested this week</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style="font-family:

special.Â  Something very real happens when hands are laid on an ordinary man</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:
Times">s head and that sacred mantle is bestowed.Â  Of that I bear personal
witness. But I also know that the Lord sustains and inspires counselors who are
called upon to assume, even temporarily, the duties of the bishop. It is still
a terribly humbling experience.Â  The counselor always knows that the mantle
remains on the shoulders of the absent bishop.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">For two or three months
everything in our ward ran fairly smoothly. We dealt with the usual concerns
common to many young couples.Â  The ward members were so good to look after each
other. Now, to those of you who are married and going to school here at
BYU-Idaho, what I am about to say will be no great revelation.Â  To those of you
who are single and whose parents</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times"> bumper sticker may appropriately read: </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:

carefully. The day is coming when you will very likely stand as a witness to
this next truth.Â  As a general rule, married students are poor, even what we
may call </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:Times">dirt-poor.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style="font-family:Times">Â  But they</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times">re happy!Â  One often hears older couples reminiscing
on their own early student years saying things like: </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:
Times">We were so happy, we had no idea how poor we really were.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Financial challenges are a
very real part of early-married life. And sometimes those challenges can be
truly overwhelming and frightening.Â  The members of our ward were no
different.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">At times, financial
situations can become so pressing that couples are forced to withdraw from
school.Â  Any of a number of situations, often including illnesses and/or loss
of employment can contribute to such circumstances.Â  As in most wards, we had a
few couples who were so struggling.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">One morning, just prior to
the end of Fall Semester, as everyone seemed to be getting ready to take final
exams and then leave for Christmas Vacation, a young couple called and said, </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:
Times">Brother Call, we really need to talk to you.Â  Can we come see you this
evening?</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style="font-family:Times">Â  Every possible problem scenario I could imagine
flashed through my mind.Â  This couple was relatively new to the ward.Â  There
was nothing out-of-the-ordinary about them that I knew of.Â  What was their
problem?Â  Why did they need to see me so urgently? Would I be able to help?Â  Were
they in financial trouble, or worse?Â  All daylong I worried about what their
problem might be and if I would be able to help them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">That evening, as they sat
side-by-side in my office, I asked how I could be of help.Â  </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:
Times">Oh, it</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times">s not us, Brother Call.</span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style="font-family:Times"> Â They
immediately began to talk not of their problems, but rather about another
couple in the ward who I knew were struggling with both serious health concerns
and financial challenges.Â  This couple would probably be withdrawing from
school.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">To my knowledge these two
couples were not significantly closer to each other than any other couples in
the ward. Neither the young husband nor wife in my office held what would be
called a leadership position in the ward.Â  The concerns they were expressing
were not the result of any official church </span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:Times">duties.</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style="font-family:
Times"> I was moved that they were simply concerned about the welfare of
another struggling brother and sister.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">They handed me an envelope
and said </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:Times">Brother Call, what we would like you to do is deliver
this for us without telling them where it comes from.Â  Will you do that for us?</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style="font-family:

their generosity and concern.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">After they left, I sat alone
in my office with the unsealed envelope on my desk. I pondered on the example
of love that I had just witnessed.Â  Then my wonderment was multiplied as I
looked in the envelope.Â  The envelope contained what today would be the
equivalent of about five hundred dollars.Â  I was physically stunned.Â  Five
hundred dollars for a young couple in college who were working minimum wage
jobs, paying tuition, setting up a household, getting ready for Christmas.Â 
This was truly a small fortune.Â  I had just been witness to an example of the
principle taught by the Lord as He and His disciples observed the widow casting

willingness to sacrifice our lives, as were Willard Richards and those others
with Joseph in Carthage Jail. Will you open the scriptures that you have
brought with you today and read with me the words of Paul found in First
Corinthians, chapter thirteen?Â  This is found on page 1454 of the New

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">May I share with you another
true story and example of this kind of love that I again witnessed at this university.Â 
A few years had passed since the previous story.Â  I was now serving in my first
year as the bishop of a campus singles ward.Â  If I needed the Lord</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:
Times">s help before while our bishop regained his health, my need was now
ten-fold.Â  I felt so keenly the need for the Lord</span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times">s direction as
I often struggled to know how to serve and teach and counsel the young people
in my ward.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Brothers and sisters, may I
once again bear my personal witness to you that our Heavenly Father sustains,
leads and guides those imperfect and weak vessels He calls to serve in His
kingdom. Something very real happens when priesthood hands are laid on an
ordinary man</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times">s head and the sacred mantle and keys of a bishop are
bestowed. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">We are each so blessed to
always have close in our lives, our <i>own</i> bishop.Â  Listen to his
teachings.Â  Follow his counsel. He has been given special keys designed to
bring down the blessings of heaven upon those whom he serves, if they will
sustain him.Â  If you will, throughout your entire life, always follow the
counsel of your bishop, no matter who the man happens to be at any given time, I
know blessings will come into your life that you will otherwise miss.Â  I know
such blessings have come into my life in direct proportion to the measure in
which I have sustained and followed my own bishop.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Well, the Lord certainly
blessed and sustained me as a new bishop as I wrestled with knowing how to help
and serve the members of my ward.Â  In particular, I remember pleading with the
Lord to help me know how to help one specific sister.Â  I</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:
Times">ll call her Susan.Â  Understand that Susan was not a bad person, but a
history of family conflicts and interpersonal crises had resulted in some
difficult challenges that often surfaced in Susan</span><span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times">s life. Susan
often felt alone, and her actions and attitude did not always bring harmony
into her apartment.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">In fact, it was often just
the opposite.Â  It seemed that Susan would always test anyone</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:
Times">s offered care and concern by pushing back, and pushing back hard.Â  As
some of you will know, such apartment situations can be very challenging and
difficult for everyone involved.Â  Towards the end of the first semester, Susan</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:
Times">s roommates had reached the end of their patience.Â  While I know they
each loved Susan, things came to a head because of some unwise choices Susan
had made which resulted in a trip for everyone to the Dean</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:
Times">s Office.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">It seemed that a solution
just could not be found to this difficult situation other than having Susan
withdraw from school the next semester. Shortly thereafter I was visiting one
day with another sister in the ward.Â  I</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times">ll call her Mandy.Â  During the course of our
interview, Mandy shared with me an experience of a few days earlier. In the
middle of the afternoon, Mandy had come home from school to her apartment,
something she rarely did. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">While home, she did
something even stranger for her, something she had never done before in the
middle of the day. She decided to go to the commons area of her apartment
complex and shoot some pool.Â  Mandy was <i>not</i> the type of girl one would
normally find shooting pool in the middle of the afternoon at the end of a
semester with finals rapidly approaching.Â  But something impressed her to do so
on this day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">When she arrived, there was
no one else in the area, except a girl she recognized from the ward but had
never spoken with, Susan. At Mandy</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times">s initiative, a conversation ensued during which
Susan, for some reason, felt comfortable sharing much of what was happening in
her life. This was unusual for Susan. She usually shared very little with
anyone, including her bishop.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Something impressed Mandy to
come home that afternoon, go to the Commons, and approach a stranger.Â  Brothers
and sisters, you and I know what that something was.Â  It</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:

She continued to follow impressions, including a challenging one that she volunteer
to switch apartments with Susan</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times">s current roommate. Due in large part to the effects
of this selfless act of love, Susan was able to stay in the apartment complex

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Mandy made this switch
knowing that challenges would certainly follow, and much to the amazement of
her many friends in the ward. Several knew something of the difficult situation

However, both Susan and Mandy</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:Times">s lives were changed for the better.Â  Both became

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Even the choices we make,
which on the surface may appear to be only for ourselves, can and should

nothing to do with a miraculous healing of the sick or the feeding of hungry
thousands.Â  It was a small decision, unknown to hardly any but his closest
disciples; a decision to do something that was not required of Him; a decision
made because of his love and concern that others might misunderstand and
falter. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Now you need to understand
what this tribute was to understand what the Lord says next to Peter.Â  This was
not a government tax but an annual religious assessment levied on all men older

pay the tax for the support of what was, in actuality, his own house? Verse
twenty-five continues:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">In my position as the
bishop, I was aware of the influence many such returned missionaries had on the

those who would shortly find themselves called as ambassadors of the Lord Jesus

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">I remember one day as one of

brethren. He was an outgoing and seemingly carefree person that seemed to
thoroughly enjoy life. Today he was wearing a most unusual and bold necktie.Â 
It literally screamed at you, so much so, in fact, that it spawned several
comments from those around him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">He explained that he had
purchased the tie while on his mission but that his mission president didn</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:

all successful missionaries must do to some extent, to come to an understanding

understanding any easier. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">As the literal sons and
daughters of an eternal and divine Father in Heaven, our ultimate goal should
be to become as He is, to dwell where He dwells, to be glorified as He is
glorified by helping to bring to pass the eternal life and exaltation of man.Â 
To achieve that divine destiny our feelings and actions towards others, <i>our
neighbors,</i> must parallel those feelings and actions of Christ, Himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">You will remember the Lord</span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-family:

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span style="font-family:Times">Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Could it possibly be that
the difference between those who ultimately achieve their divine destiny, and
those who dwell eternally in non-celestial realms, will have more to do with
how they understood and lived the second commandment than the first?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Ultimately, charity is a
gift from God given only to those who truly love Him and ask for this gift in
faith.Â  As with all things, faith is demonstrated through action.Â  Faith
without works truly <i>is</i> dead. <i>(James 1:17)Â  </i>The many acts of love
I have witnessed on this campus over the past twenty years, are but examples of
that living faith shown by those who, I am certain, have also spent time on
their knees pleading for Heavenly Father to grant them this most desirable and
greatest of all gifts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">Brothers and sisters, I bear
to you my personal witness of the divine origin of this gift.Â  I have been
blessed of the Lord on occasion to taste of this gift in some small degree.Â 
Perhaps in no more profound way, than the first time I stood in front of 150
students like you, having been called several weeks earlier to serve as their
new bishop.Â  We were to be a new ward when school reconvened.Â  I was called
while they were gone for the summer. None of us knew each other. For the three
weeks before school began I had only a list of 150 names.Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">How could I learn to
properly serve these brothers and sisters?Â  How long would it take me to come
to truly love them? Time was spent on my knees as I anxiously awaited their
arrival and our first meeting together.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">I remember vividly that
Sunday morning, as these choice sons and daughters of God raised their hands,
itself an act of faith and love on their part, to sustain me as their new
bishop.Â  As I stood in front of them for the first time, I felt a love so deep,
so profound, and so eternal for people I had never before seen, that I knew I
was being offered a taste of this divine gift of charity - the very love that
Christ feels for each of us.Â  The Lord had heard and answered my prayers. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Times">I bear witness that He will
continue to do so in each of our lives, if we will ask in faith, demonstrated
by our seeking for, recognizing and following impressions born of the Spirit to
love and serve one another.Â  Of these things, and especially of His divinity
and love for each of us, I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let's begin with a scripture. Please turn with me to
Proverbs 3:5-6.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="WP9BlockText">Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto
thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct
thy paths (Proverbs 3:5-6).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What does it mean to trust with all thy heart? Webster's
Dictionary defines the word trust as: &quot;to rely on, to hope, to believe, to
have confidence in, to have implicit faith in.&quot; Implicit means:
&quot;complete, absolute, without doubt.&quot; So, to restate that scripture,
&quot;Have confidence in, rely on, believe in, have complete, absolute faith in
the Lord.&quot; The second part of this scripture admonishes us to &quot;lean
not [or rely not] unto [our] own understanding.&quot; Why is that important,
even necessary, if we are to <b>fulfill </b>our individual missions in this
life?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To illustrate, I would like to tell you &quot;A Tale of Two
Prophets.&quot; The first one is Moses. Let's turn to Exodus 3. Now you recall
the story of Moses who was found in the bulrushes by the daughter of Pharoah.
She adopted him and brought him up in the courts of Egypt. When he grew to be a
man, however, it tells us in verse 11 of chapter 2 that </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:31.5pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">he went out unto his brethren [the
Hebrews who were at that time in captivity] and looked on their burdens: and he
spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren...he slew the Egyptian
and hid him in the sand (Exodus 2:11).Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:31.5pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because of this, Moses was forced to flee into the land of Midian.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now let's pick up the story in Chapter 3, verse 1, &quot;Now
Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he
led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God,
even to Horeb.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And the presence of the Lord appeared
unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and,
behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed (Exodus 3:1-2,
JST).Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I suppose Moses was a bit astonished at that, but probably a
bit more astonished when in verse 4, &quot;God called unto him out of the midst
of the bush and said, Â“Moses, Moses&quot; (Moses 3:4).Â  In verse 6 he
identifies himself. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:27.0pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:27.0pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">I am the God of thy father, the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for
he was afraid to look upon God (Moses 3:6).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now I'm not sure how I would respond if something like that
happened to me, but probably much the same way Moses did.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In verse 7 the Lord explains his purpose in coming, &quot;I
have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard
their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; And I am
come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians&quot; (Moses 3:7-8).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now if you were Moses, wouldn't you be thinking, &quot;Okay,
but why are you telling me this?&quot; Then comes the big surprise in verse 10,
&quot;Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest
bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt&quot; (Exodus 3:10).Â 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now think about Moses' background. He has had to escape from
Egypt; they don't particularly like him there, and now he's being asked, or
commanded rather, to go back and try to talk Pharaoh into letting thousands of
slaves go free. He has reason to be a little nervous about this assignment,
doesn't he? And he reacts as I think many of us would. In Verse 11, he replies,
&quot;Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth
the children of Israel out of Egypt&quot; (Exodus 3:11)?Â  What he is saying is,
&quot;WHAT? WHO, ME?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Have you ever been given an assignment that you just felt
absolutely inadequate to do? If not, just wait, you will! I have always thought
that the worst thing that could ever happen to me would be to be called as a
Gospel Doctrine teacher. It was my worst fear. It's even worse than being a
nursery leader. It would just be way too scary for me. So when I was called to
be a Gospel Doctrine teacher, I couldn't believe it. I literally said,
&quot;WHAT? WHO, ME? Are you sure?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now Moses is being asked to do something much more scary
than teaching a Gospel Doctrine class.Â  I think I can understand how he must
have felt.Â  But the Lord is prepared for that, and He comforts him in verse 12
by saying, &quot;Certainly I will be with thee&quot; (Exodus 3:12).Â  At this point,
however, I don't think Moses really hears that or believes it. He just wants
out of this!Â  Verse 13, &quot;And Moses said unto God, [Â…] when I come unto the
children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent
me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say&quot;
(Exodus 3:13).Â  Verse 14, &quot;And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM [...]
Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto youÂ”
(Exodus 3:14).Â  Moses is still not convinced.Â  And in chapter 4 verse 1 he
says, &quot;They will not believe me&quot; (Exodus 4:1).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord then reveals His power by showing Moses a couple of
miracles. Miracle # 1 - He tells Moses to cast the rod in his hand on the
ground. Moses does so and it becomes a serpent. Then the Lord tells him to take
it by the tail and it becomes a rod again. Miracle # 2 - (verse 6) &quot;Put
your hand into your bosom, [Moses]&quot; (Exodus 4:6).Â  He does that and his
hand comes out &quot;leprous as snow&quot; (Exodus 4:6).Â  The Lord tells him to
do it again and this time it comes out clean. &quot;And if they will not
believe also these two signs,&quot; He says, &quot;take of the water of the
river, and pour it upon the dry land: [Â…] and shall become blood upon the dry
land&quot; (Moses 4:).Â  I think He's saying to Moses, &quot;You know I have the
power to do this.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Moses tries another excuse.Â  He really doesn't want this
job.Â  In verse 10, &quot;O my Lord, I am not eloquent...but I am slow of
speech, and of a slow tongue&quot; (Exodus 4:10).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Can you sense the Lord getting a little frustrated here?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Verse 11: &quot;Who hath made man's mouth [Moses]?Â  Or who
maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? Have not I the
Lord?&quot;Â  In other words, have a little faith, Moses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Verse 12: &quot;Now therefore go, and I will be with thy
mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say&quot; (Exodus 4:12).Â  Moses still
doesn't think he can do it.Â  Have you ever had the experience of trying to
teach a child to do something and he/she just says, &quot;I can't&quot; and
won't even try? This is what Moses is doing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now the Lord is pretty upset with Moses. Verse 14: &quot;And
the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses&quot; (Exodus 4:14).Â  Finally,
he appoints Aaron to be a spokesman for him. Now the scriptures don't say this,
but I think Moses lost an opportunity there. The Lord is promising to be his
mouth, but he doesn't quite have the faith to believe it or to try it. He is
not &quot;trusting implicitly&quot; in the Lord.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now let's take a look at another prophet, Enoch, who had a
similar experience. Please turn with me to Moses 6 in the Pearl of Great
Price.Â  Beginning in 6:26, it says, &quot;And it came to pass that Enoch
journeyed in the land, among the people; and as he journeyed, the Spirit of God
descended out of heaven, and abode upon himÂ” (Moses 6:26).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And he heard a voice from heaven
saying: Enoch, my son, prophesy unto this people, and [tell them to repent]
(Moses 6:27).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another direct call from God. And how does Enoch respond?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Why is it that I have found favor in
thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech;
wherefore am I thy servant (Moses 6:31).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sound familiar? Same response as Moses, right?Â  &quot;Why
me, Lord? I am slow of speech.&quot;Â  I can't do that! However, there's one
significant difference here. When the Lord says to Enoch in verse 32, &quot;Go
forth and do as I have commanded thee...Open thy mouth, <b>and it shall be
filled, and I will </b>give thee utterance&quot; (Moses 6:32). Enoch is
satisfied, he does not argue or try to get out of it. Unlike Moses, who said,
&quot;I just don't think I can do that,&quot; verse 37 tells us that,
&quot;Enoch went forth in the land, among the people, standing upon the hills
and the high places, and cried with a loud voice, testifying against their
works&quot; (Moses 6:37).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Enoch believed that the Lord was capable of magnifying his
abilities so that he could accomplish whatever the Lord wanted him to do. He
did trust in the Lord implicitly and went forth to do what he was commanded.
Let's look at the result.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And it came to pass when they heard him
[Enoch], no man laid hands on him; for fear came on all them that heard him;
for he walked with God (Moses 6:39).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And so great was the faith of Enoch
that he led the people of God, and their enemies came to battle against them;
and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains
fled, even according to his command; and the rivers of water were turned out of
their course; and the roar of the lions was heard out of the wilderness; and
all nations feared greatly, so powerful was the word of Enoch, and so great was
the power of the language which God had given him (Moses 6:13). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I love that!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do you think Moses could have used a gift like that when the
children of Israel were complaining in the desert? The Lord gave them both the
same promise that he would put the words into their mouths. Enoch believed and
accepted the word of God and became mighty in speech; Moses complained and made
excuses and lost the opportunity to grow. Now I'm not saying that Moses was not
a great prophet; he certainly was, but could he have been greater? Could he have
been more persuasive by accepting the gift that the Lord offered him? Enoch was
able to take his city up to heaven; Moses wandered in the wilderness for forty
years and then was not permitted to enter the Promised Land. It's something to
think about.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So what can we learn from these two prophets? How many of us
fall short of our potential because we lack faith in ourselves or in God's
ability to make us better than we are? To make us equal to the tasks he sets
for us? Do we, like Moses, say, &quot;Oh, I don't think I can do thatÂ—I'm not
good enough,&quot; or &quot;people will laugh at me,&quot; or &quot;I'm too
busy,&quot; or &quot;I'm too tired,&quot; and we lose the opportunity to grow?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is my testimony to you that the Lord has a plan for each
of our lives, and that when we turn our lives over to him, He can make us much
greater than we ever could become on our own. President Thomas Monson has said,
&quot;Some of you may be shy by nature or consider yourselves inadequate to
respond affirmatively to a calling. Remember that this work is not yours and
mine alone. It is the Lord's work. And when we are on the Lord's errand, we are
entitled to the Lord's help. Remember that whom the Lord calls, the Lord
qualifies&quot; (Ensign, May 1996, 44).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes it's uncomfortable, even painful, but that is how
we grow. You may not be called to be a prophet or a general authority, but you
might. We are all given opportunities for callings that may take us out of our
comfort zone, and we might say, like Enoch and Moses, Â“Why me?Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Joseph Smith must have been pretty overwhelmed when the Lord
commanded him to translate the gold plates and to organize His church upon the
earth. Talk about a big assignment! Now Joseph Smith had very little formal
schooling, and he was young, but he had faith; he believed that the Lord would
help him accomplish whatever he was assigned to do. He did not doubt but
trusted, and what amazing things he accomplished. In Doctrine &amp; Covenants
135:3 we read the testimony of John Taylor, a witness to the martyrdom of
Joseph and Hyrum: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer
of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this
world, than any other man that ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty
years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift
and power of God, and has been the means of publishing it on two continents;
has sent the fullness of the everlasting gospel...to the four quarters of the
earth, brought forth the...Doctrine &amp; Covenants...gathered many thousands
of the Latter-day Saints, founded a great city, and left a fame and name that
cannot be slain. (Doctrine and Covenants 135:3)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You and I are now reaping the rewards of his faith and
absolute trust in God. What if he had said, &quot;No, I don't think I can do
that.&quot; Where would we be today?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is evident that Nephi understood this principle as well.
When the Lord commanded him to build a ship to take his people to the promised
land, Nephi did not make excuses and say, Â“I've never built a shipÂ—I don't know
how.Â  I don't think I can do that.Â” He simply said, &quot;Lord, whither shall I
go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the
ship&quot; (1 Nephi 17:9)? No hesitation, no excusesÂ—just absolute faith and
trust. Laman and Lemuel did not have that kind of faith. Their response was,
&quot;Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and
he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters&quot; (1 Nephi 17:17).
Right! He's just a dreamer like our father. We can see the effect these
different attitudes had in their lives.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Alma, after having been rejected by the people of Ammonihah
who &quot;reviled him, and spit upon him, and . . . cast [him] out of their
city,&quot; left feeling pretty discouraged, but when an angel of the Lord
appeared to him and told him to go back to Ammonihah and try again, he didn't
say, &quot;I've done that already, and they won't believe me. It's no
use.&quot; The scriptures tell us that, &quot;he returned speedily&quot; (Alma
8:13,18).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Savior, of course, is our primary example. Even before
he came to this earth he said, &quot;Here am I, send me&quot; (Abraham 3:27).
This shows, first of all, a willingness to do the will of his father. That is
the first step. We must be willing to put the Lord's will first in our lives no
matter what it costs us personally. At a very young age, Jesus' first recorded
mortal words were &quot;I must be about my Father's business&quot; (Luke 2:49).
Jesus never lost sight of his Father's will or his own mission. Even in his
incomprehensible suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, when great drops of blood
fell from every pore as he paid the atoning price for all our sins, he did not
surrender to the power of the adversary; his focus was firmly fixed on his
mission. He could have called upon legions of angels to rescue him, but he did
not (New Testament Gospel Doctrine Manual, p.111). What if he had failed? What
if he had said, &quot;This is too hard; I don't think I can do this.&quot; He
did say, &quot;Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:
nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done&quot; (Luke 22:42). Even in his
intense agony, when he surely would have liked to give up, he still submitted
to the will of his father. Where would we all be if he had failed because it
was too hard?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes, well most of the time, the things we are asked to
do are not easy. Sometimes we may have to sacrifice or give up some of the
things we want to do. Many of you have already given two years of your life to
serve as a missionary; that is only the beginning. I've heard President
Hinckley say, &quot;Sure, I'd like to sit home in the rocking chair like other
people my age, but that would not be making a contribution.&quot; President
Hinckley is a marvelous example of obedience and dedication to <b>fulfilling
the will </b>of the Lord. All of his life he has followed the promptings of the
spirit which have prepared him to be our prophet today. What if he had said,
&quot;That sounds like too much work; I don't think I want to do that.&quot;
What a sad thing it would be if we had been deprived of his great leadership
because he chose not to trust in the Lord to guide his life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes we may have to struggle or even be persecuted
because of our beliefs. The scriptures are full of accounts of the suffering,
persecution, and trials that people have gone through to do the will of the
Lord. Last year when we were studying the Old Testament, I got kind of a
chuckle from reading about the prophet Jeremiah. Jeremiah had a pretty tough
job of trying to turn apostate Israel away from idolatry. He had a life full of
sorrow and grief, and his life was constantly threatened. At one point he said,
&quot;Cursed be the day wherein I was born&quot; (Jeremiah 20:14). Sometimes we
might feel like that. But Jeremiah, even though he endured overwhelming
opposition, went ahead and courageously delivered the message he was asked to give
and was faithful in his assignment as a prophet of God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Joseph Smith certainly did not have an easy life either, did
he? In Doctrine and Covenants 127:2 he says, &quot;The envy and wrath of man
have been my common lot all the days of my life...deep water is what I am wont
to swim in. It all has become a second nature to me&quot; (Doctrine and
Covenants 127:2).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes we may even try to avoid spiritual experiences
because they can be physically exhausting, and we're not quite ready for that.
An account is told when Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon saw the vision of the
degrees of glory, which is recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants Section 76.
According to witnesses who were in the room, &quot;Joseph sat firmly and calmly
all the time in the midst of a magnificent glory, but Sidney sat limp and pale,
apparently as limber as a rag, observing which, Joseph remarked smilingly,
`Sidney is not used to it as I am.&quot;' You may recall that Joseph Smith,
after his first visits from Moroni, did not have the strength to work the next
day either. It takes a lot out of you. Like other principles of the gospel, you
learn step by step.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You students of this generation have been given great gifts
of the spirit. You have been told that you have a responsibility to be leaders
in the church and in the world, and you must be prepared. You must have faith
in the Lord and faith in yourselves that you have the capacity to be great with
his help. I love the quote by Nelson Mandela given at his 1994 Inaugural
Address: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Our deepest fear is not that we are
inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our
light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to
be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to
be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There's
nothing enlightening about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure
around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light
shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are
liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Whatever our particular missions in life are, I am convinced
that we can only fulfill them effectively by listening to the spirit and
following its promptings. Often we are asked to do things, and we don't
understand why, but we must remember that God sees the whole plan from
beginning to end and we do not. Thus we should &quot;lean not unto [our] own
understanding&quot; (Proverbs 3:5). Elder Boyd K. Packer relates the following
story:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Shortly after I was called as a General
Authority, I went to Elder Harold B. Lee for counsel. He listened very
carefully to my problem and suggested that I see President David O. McKay.
President McKay counseled me as to the direction I should go. I was very
willing to be obedient but saw no way possible for me to do as he counseled me
to do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">I returned to Elder Lee and told him
that I saw no way to move in the direction I was counseled to go. He said, `The
trouble with you is you want to see the end from the beginning.' I replied that
I would like to see at least a step or two ahead. Then came the lesson of a
lifetime: `You must learn to walk to the edge of the light, and then a few
steps into the darkness; then the light will appear and show the way before
you' (&quot;The Edge of the Light,&quot; <i>BYU Today</i>, Mar. 1991, 22-23).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have learned from personal experience that this is true. A
few years ago, when my youngest child was in junior high, I began to get a
prompting that I needed to go back to school and finish my education. I had
only had one year of college before I was married; all I ever wanted to do was
be a mom, and I loved being a mom; it was my favorite job ever, but life
doesn't always work out the way you planned. It's full of surprises, so be
prepared to adjust! Anyway, at that time I had a very strong impression that I
needed to get an education and that I needed it NOW. I thought about all the majors
that would get me a job making lots of money, but that just didn't seem to be
what I was supposed to do. My great love was literature, so after some
consideration, I decided that what I really wanted to do was major in English
and teach at Ricks College. I prayed about it and had a confirmation of the
spirit that that was what I should do. I finished my associate's degree at
Ricks College and then I had to move on to a 4-year university. Just to see
what my chances of teaching at Ricks College were, I went to visit with the
person who was the English Department chair at that time (I won't mention any
names, and I'm sure that person won't remember this). He told me that the
department had all the teachers they needed and that he didn't foresee any need
for more teachers for a long time. He said, &quot;If I were you, I would change
my major.&quot; Well, that was a little discouraging, but I knew what I had
been told to do, so I went ahead with it in spite of the odds. I knew that if
that's what the Lord had told me to do, there must be a reason, although I
couldn't necessarily see it at the time. I finished my bachelor's and master's
degrees at Idaho State University, and interestingly enough, the year that I
finished, there was an opening in the English Department. There has been almost
every year since, so here I am. Obviously, the Lord knew something that that
English Department chair did notÂ—well, actually none of us did! If I had not
followed the promptings of the Lord, I would not have been prepared when the opportunity
came. And, more importantly, I would not have been prepared to provide for my
family when, the year after I graduated, my husband died suddenly of a heart
attack. I could not have foreseen that, but my Heavenly Father knew, and He
helped me to be ready. I love the Lord; I trust Him, and I absolutely know that
I could not do any of the things I do without His help. I donÂ’t know the whole
plan for my life, but I know that He does, and I know that if I try to live
worthy and follow the promptings of the spirit, I will be prepared for whatever
happens in my life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One final story. You may recall the wonderful experience
that Elder Russell M. Nelson related in his last conference talk. Elder Nelson,
as you know, was a heart surgeon before he became an apostle. He told of a
stake patriarch from southern Utah who came to his office more than 40 years
ago, during the early pioneering days of heart surgery. He says, &quot;This
saintly soul suffered much because of a failing heart. He pleaded for help,
thinking that his condition resulted from a damaged but repairable valve in his
heart.&quot; After extensive evaluation, it was found that there were actually
two faulty valves; one could be operated on while the other could not. After
several visits, the man came to Dr. Nelson in desperation and said, &quot;Dr.
Nelson, I have prayed for help and have been directed to you. The Lord will not
reveal to me how to repair that second valve, but He can reveal it to you. Your
mind is so prepared. If you will operate upon me, the Lord will make it known
to you what to do. Please perform the operation that I need, and pray for the
help that you need.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now here is an indirect call from the Lord by someone in
need of help. Elder Nelson could have said, &quot;I can't do that because I
don't have the knowledge or experience to do thatÂ—a man's life is at stake
here.&quot; But instead, he &quot;trusted in the Lord with all his heart&quot;
(Proverbs 3:5). Elder Nelson prayed fervently, but even as the operation
commenced, he still had no idea what he was going to do. Nevertheless, he went
ahead, trusting that through his faith and the faith of this good patriarch,
the Lord would reveal to him how to repair the valve. Elder Nelson says,
&quot;After relieving the obstruction of the first valve, we exposed the second
valve. We found it to be intact but so badly dilated that it could no longer
function as it should. While examining this valve, a message was distinctly
impressed upon my mind: Reduce the circumference of the ring . . . But how? We
could not apply a belt as one would use to tighten the waist of oversized
trousers. We could not squeeze with a strap as one would cinch a saddle on a
horse. Then a picture came vividly to my mind, showing how stitches could be
placed - to make a pleat here and a tuck there - to accomplish the desired
objective. I still remember that mental image - complete with dotted lines
where sutures should be placed. The repair was completed as diagrammed in my
mind. We tested the valve and found the leak to be reduced remarkably. My
assistant said, &quot;It's a miracle.&quot; The patient's recovery was rapid
and he lived for many more years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I testify to you that miracles happen when the Lord is in
charge. Each of us has been given certain skills and abilities to fulfill a
particular mission here on the earth at this time. You were saved for such a
time as this. Doctrine &amp; Covenants 6:36 tells us: &quot;Look unto me in
every thought; doubt not, fear not&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants 6:36).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Back to our beginning scripture: &quot;Trust in the Lord
with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy
ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths&quot; (Proverbs 3:5-6). I
bear testimony to you that only the Lord knows what you are capable ofÂ—He
created you. The only way that you can learn what your abilities are is to let
Him guide your life. It is my prayer that you will give Him that chance. Trust
Him, love Him, and let Him guide you. You might even amaze yourself In the name
of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am very happy to be here with my wife, Isabel Hales
Cannon.Â  I hope many of you will have the opportunity of meeting her after the
devotional.Â  She has a special spot in her heart for this university.Â  In 1916
her father and mother, Wayne and Belle Hales, started their married life in
Rexburg.Â  Wayne B. Hales had been hired as a member of the faculty.Â  They lived
here for 5 years.Â  His first assignment was to teach physics, algebra,
trigonometry and the New Testament.Â  They always talked with great fondness of
those first five years of their married life.Â  In Brother Hales biography, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>my life story<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> he summarizes those five
years with five short paragraphs.Â  I want to share one of them with you.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>We are exposed to a type of
religious faith and moral living which was quite unique in the Church.Â  It was
all on such a high plane of living that it became our ideal of performance in
years to come.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  This
great spirit to which Brother Hales referred has continued to be a part of this
splendid university.Â  I am grateful for what each one of you are contributing
to that spirit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What joy it is to be with President and Sister Bednar.Â  We
first met this remarkable couple when President Bednar was serving as the
president of the Arkansas stake.Â  After spending a few days with them both
Isabel and I remarked this couple has a great contribution to make.Â  We have
watched with interest and delight in the many contributions they have made and
continue to make as remarkable citizens in the kingdom of God.Â  Thank you
President and Sister Bednar for giving us the privilege of being here and
rubbing shoulders with you and this outstanding faculty and student body.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">March 12, 1995 Gordon B. Hinckley was ordained the prophet
and set apart as the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints in the Salt Lake temple.Â  The following day he held a press conference
in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building. At that conference he made this most
significant statement about you.Â  Here is what he said---<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>we are particularly proud
of our youth.Â  I think we have never had a stronger generation of young men and
women than we have today.Â  For the most part they are true to the faith of
their forebears.Â  Surrounded by forces that would pull them down and tremendous
pressures to pull them away from time-tested virtues, they are going forward
with constructive lives, nurturing themselves both intellectually and spiritually.Â 
We have no fears or doubts concerning the future of this work.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What confidence President Hinckley has in each one of you!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 1968 Sister Cannon and I were presiding over a mission in
Great Britain.Â  We had as our supervising general authority Spencer W.
Kimball.Â  At that time he was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.Â 
On one occasion he came to visit us and I asked if he would be willing to speak
at a fireside composed of recent converts to the church.Â  He graciously
accepted and we had an inspiring evening with him.Â  The mission home was filled
with many converts most of them having been in the church for six months or
less.Â  He said to them, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I
want to share two thoughts with you.Â  The first thing I want you to know is
that membership in the church is a call to leadership.Â  (He went on to tell
them that they needed to serve in the church and as they did their testimonies
would grow stronger and they would be faithful in the churchÂ  (I am sure this
came as a surprise to many of them because they had already done many things to
prepare for their baptism. -- they had given up their cup of tea, going to the
pub on Saturday night, coming to church on Sunday morning.Â  Commence paying
their tithing and so forth.Â  I believe that if President Kimball were here
today he might be telling each one of you that <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>membership
in the church is a call to leadership.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
It is so important that we lose ourselves in serving our Savior and our
fellowmen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He commended them for being baptized and confirmed member of
the church and receiving the holy ghost.Â  He said you have now entered into the
kingdom of god, but what you have done is only the beginningÂ  nowÂ  you must
prepare yourself to go to the House of the Lord, the temple, when the time is
right for you where you can receive the ordinances of the templeÂ and make
sacred covenants with the Lord that you might prepare yourself and your
families to be exalted in the celestial kingdom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My message to you today is related to what appears on the
front of the one hundred and fifteen temples which are found throughout the
world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Holiness
to the Lord.Â  The House of the Lord.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
I hope the next time you enter the temple you would look at those words and
contemplate what they represent.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was pleased when I learned that you bring your own
scriptures to the devotionalÂ  (Please hold them up so I can see them.).Â  Will
youÂ  turn to the Doctrine and Covenants, section 36 and we will read together
the final verse. (Read verse 8).Â Â  HereÂ  the savior is speaking to the Prophet
Joseph Smith only 9 months after the church was restored.Â  Now turn to section
97.Â  A revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith a little over three years
after the restoration of the gospel.Â  (Read verses 10, and then 11.and 12.)Â Â Â 
Here the Savior is emphasizing the importance of tithing. I hope every time you
pay your tithing you know you are contributing to building temples throughout
the world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then we have those wonderful promises in verses 15 and 16.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On March 27, 1846, the Kirtland temple was dedicated.Â  It is
significantÂ  to note that the first building erected after the restorationÂ of
the gospel was a temple.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder John A. Widtsoe, a convert to the church from Norway
and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, has been quoted as saying, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t believe there has ever
been a building erected in the history of the world that has required more
sacrifice than that of those early Saints.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Turn to section 109.Â  It is the dedicatory prayer for the
Kirtland temple..Â  You will note at the beginning is stated, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>This prayer was given to
him (the Prophet Joseph Smith) by revelation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I amÂ going to give you an assignment.Â  I hope each one of
you will take the time within the next week to read aloud to yourself this
dedicatoryÂ  prayer.Â  It is one of the most inspiring scriptures we have. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the Sabbath day, April 3, 1836.Â  The fullness of the
gospel was ushered in.Â  Turn to section 110.Â  Here is recorded the Savior
visiting the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery.Â  Listen to the Savior<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s words, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>for behold I have accepted
this house, and my name shall be here; and I will manifest myself to my people

<p class="MsoNormal">Consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out, and
the endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After the Savior<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
visit there appeared three heavenly messengers<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>Moses
commiting the keys of the gathering of Israel -- Elias committing the
dispensation of the gospel of Abraham and then finally Elijah that great old
testament prophet who was caught up in heaven.Â  He bestowed upon the Prophet
Joseph Smith the keys of the sealing power.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What a great endowment of power was bestowed upon the church
in the Kirtland temple.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How thrilled and grateful we are for the restoration of the
second temple--the Nauvoo temple.Â  It was in Nauvoo that the fullness of the
temple ordinances were revealed for the living.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Also were revealed the sacred ordinances of baptism and
confirmation for the dead.Â  These sacred ordinances helped prepare the saints
for the trek to the rocky mountains where temples could be erected as
prophesied in Isaiah.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Four days after Brigham Young arrived in the Salt Lake
valley in 1847Â  he walked to a spot between two creeks put down his cane and

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During the church<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
April, 1853, general conference, President Young recalled this experience;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I
scarcely say much about revelations, or visions, but suffice it to say, five
years ago last July I was here and saw in the spirit , the temple not ten feet
from where we have laid the chief corner stone.Â  I have not inquired what kind
of a temple we should build.Â  Why?Â  Because it was represented before me.Â  I
have never looked upon that ground, but the vision of it was there.Â  I see it
as plainly as if it was in reality before me.Â  Wait until it is done.Â  I will
say, however, that it will have six towers.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
(Sermons of Brigham Young, delivered in the old Tabernacle in Salt Lake City,
Utah 6 April 1853 JD l:ll)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The apostle who drove in the stake where Brigham Young put
down his cane was Wilford Woodruff.Â  On April 6, 1893 Wilford Woodruff, who was
president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, dedicated the
SaltÂ  Lake temple.Â  For President Woodruff, this occasion was the fulfillment
of a dream he had several years earlier.Â  He confided in his journal <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>nearly fifty years ago
while in the city of Boston I had a vision of going with the saints to the
rocky mountains building a temple and dedicated it.Â  Two nights in succession
before John Taylor<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
death (1887) President Brigham Young (who had died ten years earlier) gave me
the keys of the temple and told me to go and dedicate it, which I did.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  (Wilford Woodruff

<p class="MsoNormal">My dear friends what a heritage we have.Â  What a blessing
for us to be living in the dispensation of the fullness of times when temples
are beginning to dot the world and you and I can be anxiously engaged in moving
this sacred work forward.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now I want to say a few words to each one of you who is
gathered here.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The temples are here to bless you and to help you become
saviors on Mt. Zion.Â  First I speak to you who have been to the temple and
received your blessings of the ordinances of the temple.Â  You have received the
great blessing of the initiatory ordinances and participated in the sacred
covenants and promises of the endowment.Â  I have always appreciated President
David O. Mckay<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
description of the endowment when he said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>&gt;</span>
to me it is a step by step ascent into the divine presence.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For you that have received these blessings, it is now your
privilege and responsibility to go back to the temple often and do this sacred
work for those beyond the veil.Â  Turn to your Doctrine and Covenants section
138 and you will get a feeling of those who are on the other side anxiously
waiting for us to do the work for them in the holy temple..Â  (read verses 12
and 14)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to share with you an experience of Elder Enzio
Busche. Elder Busche is a convert to the church fromÂ  Germany.Â  He served as a
member of the Quorum of the Seventy and was called to be the first president of
the Frankfurt, Germany temple.Â  He related this experience at a luncheon held
in the tabernacle between the sessions of a regional meeting held in January,
1994.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Busche would observe that when the French speaking
group came to the temple, there was an elderly brother who was the first to enter
the temple and the last one to leave.Â  Elder Busche was very much aware of this
brother because of his devotion but because Elder Busche did not speak French,
he wasn<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t able to
communicate with him. Often the brother would come to him and shake his hand
and say, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Merci
Presidente, merci Presidente.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One day Elder Busche was able, through an interpreter, to
learn about him and his conversion to the church.Â  For many years this brother
served as a clerk in a large cathedral in Belgium.Â  One of his duties was to
show visitors about the cathedral.Â  He earned a meager income in this job.Â 
Many of the people he took around the cathedral were tourists from England and
America.Â  One day he read in the newspaper where he could attend some English
classes for free. (You and I know who were teaching these classes.) he decided
to attend those classes and as a consequence in three months he was a member of
the Church and no longer an employee at the cathedral.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One year after his baptism he received his temple recommend
and went to the temple in Bern, Switzerland.Â  As he participated in those
sacred ordinances in the temple he was permitted to see many of his ancestors
who were on the other side of the veil and who indicated to him that they had
been waiting for him to join the church and come to the temple so that he could
perform their sacred ordinances for them.Â  This was why he needed to take every
opportunity he could to be in the House of the Lord as often as he could to do
this sacred work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His comment to Elder Busche was; <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>for many, many years I spent my life in a
house surrounded by deathÂ  (Cathedrals are burial grounds for the church
hierarchy) --now I go into the house of the lord and I am surrounded by life.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To you that have been sealed in the holy temple there is no
greater blessing that can be bestowed upon a husband and wife upon this
earth.Â Â  You have been sealed for time and all eternity.Â  You have been sealed
to come forth in the morning of the first resurrection together.Â  All of the
blessings promised to the posterity of Abraham and Jacob can be yours if you
are true and faithful to each other and those sacred covenants which you have
made. Some of the time when you return to the temple participate in those
sacred sealings for those beyond the grave.Â  You can also participate in
sealings of families. What a joy you can feel as families are united for
eternity.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One day there was a five year old boy who had been sealed to
his parents.Â  As the sister ordinance worker walked with him back to the youth
center she asked him how everything went.Â  His response was <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t exactly understand what
the man said but I do know that we have been glued together.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  How true that is.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now to those of you who have not yet been to the temple to
receive your temple ordinances,. you can be in the temple regularly performing
that sacred work of baptisms and confirmations for those on the other side of
the veil. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I was in the temple presidency I would often go to the
baptistry early in the morning and observe the wonderful young people doing
baptisms and confirmations I loved to hear the swishing of the water.Â  One
morning at 6 a.m. I witnessed a father baptizing his daughter.Â  When I visited
with them I found out that it was the daughter<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
12th birthday.Â  The father said she wanted to be in the temple on her 12th
birthday.Â  What a joy it was to see that father, the daughter and the mother
all together in the holy temple.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would remind all of you that when you enter the temple you
are entering the university of God. Here you will learn and feel eternal truths
that will sustain you through the many challenges this life brings to all of
us.Â  Here you can receive personal inspiration and revelation concerning your
life and that of your loved ones.Â  The veil is very thin in the temple.Â  It is
important to remember that the teacher in the temple is the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During part of the period when we presided over the Salt
Lake temple, President Howard W. Hunter served as the President of the Church.Â 
He served for only nine months, but from the day he became the prophet until he
passed away he taught us about the temple.Â  We witnessed many people coming to
the temple with their families to receive the blessings as they listened to and
followed the prophet. Here are some of the great truths he taught us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I
invite the members of the church to establish the temple of the Lord as the
great symbol of their membership. It would be the deepest desire of my heart to
have every member of the church to be temple worthy.Â  I would hope that every
adult member would be worthy of--and carry-a current temple recommend, even if
proximity to a temple does not allow immediate or frequent use of it.Â  Let us
be a temple-attending and a temple-loving people.Â  Let us hasten to the temple as
frequently as time and means and personal circumstances allow.Â  Let us go not
only for our kindred dead, but let us also go for the personal blessing of
temple worship.Â  ...the temple is a place of beauty, it is a place of
revelation, it is a place of peace.Â  It is the House of the Lord.Â  It is holy
unto the Lord.Â  It should be holy unto us.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Hunter<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
final words to the church appeared in the FebruaryÂ 1995 <i>Ensign</i>.Â  He passed
away March 3rd, 1995.Â  I would like to quote a few sentences from that articleÂ 
<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>All of our efforts in
proclaiming the gospel, perfecting the saints, and redeeming the dead lead to
the holy temple.Â  This is because the temple ordinances are absolutely crucial:
we cannot return to God<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
presence without them.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
I would like to repeat the last two sentencesÂ  -- <span style='font-family:

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now we are led and guided by a living prophet, Gordon B.
Hinckley.Â  He has dedicated temples all over the world.Â  The next one will be
in Brisbane, Australia.Â  What a great example he is to all of us of oneÂ  who
magnifies the <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>spirit
of Elijah.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  Listen to
these inspiring words:--</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>We
shall continue the great work that goes on in our temples, an unmatched work of
love reaching out even to those who have gone beyond the veil of death.Â  Can
there be a greater labor of love than this?Â  It comes more nearly of partaking
of the spirit of the lord himself, who gave his life as a vicarious sacrifice
for all of us, than any other work of which I know.Â  It is done in the name of
him whose salvation is universal.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
(Ensign Nov. 1982)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Every
temple that we build becomes a memorial to the truth that we believe in the
immortality of the human soul.Â  Everything that occurs in these temples is
concerned with the eternities... the temple becomes the great bridge from this
life to the next and finds expression in the most unselfish kind of service of
which I am aware.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>We
have not received the fullness of the gospel until we have received all the
ordinances of the gospel in the temple.Â  We come unto Christ through the
ordinances of the temple. (Temple Meeting Feb. 4, 1998)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I come to the conclusion of this talkÂ  I would remind all
of us that in the temple we are taught how we can become like our Father in
Heaven and our elder brother, Jesus Christ.Â  Everything that takes place in the
temple is to prepare us to return and be with them and with our loved ones.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Savior bestows great blessings upon us in the temple.Â 
There is no blessing he will not give to us if we are true and faithful and
keep the covenants which we make with him in his house.Â  It is important to
remember that we are making our covenants with him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is our responsibility to remember these covenants and to
live them.Â  Every covenant we make will bless us and our posterity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is in the temple we are taught the celestial law.Â  It is
in the world and in our homes we are given the opportunity of living it.Â  Temple
ordinances do not save us by themselves.Â  They teach us how to live so that we
can be saved.Â  Elder Neal Maxwell in addressing a seminar of newly called
temple presidents said. <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>It
is not important to go through the temple, what is important is to have the
temple go through us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder J. Ballard Washburn, who served in the Quorum of the
Seventy, has said he believes there are two subjects which the Savior will
inquire about when we report to him.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>1. 
Have
you received the ordinances and kept the covenants of the holy temple?Â  And 2. Give me a report on your family.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Boyd K. Packer has taught us much about the temple.Â 
He has written-- <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>it
is in the temple we become a covenant people. .our labors in the temple provide
us a shield and a protection, both individually and as a people.Â  If we will
accept the revelation concerning temple ordinances, and if we will enter into
our covenants without reservation, the Lord will protect us.Â  We will receive
inspiration sufficient for the challenges of life.<span style='font-family:

<p class="MsoNormal">In the early history of the Church a revelation was given

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do we read this only as a line from the pages of history, or
simply as an invitation for us to be involved?Â  Or do we hear it as an urgent <i>call
</i>in our hearts and in our minds?Â  A call today to have the spiritual
strength sufficient to raise the standard with the same fervor as Captain Moroni
when he fearlessly <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>.

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With these same values burning within our hearts let us go
forth raising the standard, whatever it requires of us. Make no mistake, we
each have a part to play in this remarkable season. The Apostle Paul speaking
to the Romans gave words for our day: <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>.

have the courage to respond to the call. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These words of the Prophet Joseph Smith during the severe

<p class="MsoNormal">The world is in chaos and we are called to make a
difference, to arise and shine here and now in the nation, the town, the
community, the neighborhood, the street in which we live, or where we may be
called to serve.Â  Make no mistake, you and I have a vital part to play in this
our second estate, or our second act, so to speak.Â  And believe me, it will
take courage. We may feel inadequate, unprepared, unworthy or fearful, but that
is no excuse. Many, many others have felt the same way. With God<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s help the light of Christ
will shine through us.Â  That war which was begun in heaven is raging here upon
the earth and we once again must take sides for or against the Kingdom of God.Â 
With the assurance that we performed well in the first act, let us go forth
with confidence, optimism and yes, anticipation as faithful Latter-day Saints,
each doing our part as we come to realize our foreordained roles in this great
drama in human history. What a tremendous time for us to be on stage!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">ARISE AND SHINE FORTH</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A few years ago I caught a glimpse of how I hope it will be
one day for each of us. The Promised Valley Playhouse in Salt Lake City
announced it was going to produce the play <i>Annie</i>.Â  Over one hundred
young girls auditioned for the leading role.Â  Following a period of intense
rehearsals, the opening night was absolutely spectacular and the young 12
year-old who played the lead took many well-deserved bows on center stage to a
standing ovation as the curtain was being drawn.Â  But as magnificent as Annie<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s performance was on stage,
her greatest moment came after graciously acknowledging the praises from the
throngs of admirers in the lobby of the theater. In a corner of the lobby I
observed an elderly gentlemen stooped with age, his eyes moist as he eagerly
searched the crowd.Â  Somehow through a small opening in that large crowd Annie
caught a glimpse of the old man. Ignoring all the public acclaim and with arms
outstretched, she called, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Grandpa,
Grandpa!<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> The crowd
parted leaving a narrow passageway for this precious moment.Â  There was
silence.Â  The elderly man reached out his arms like giant parentheses and drew
his precious granddaughter close to him while the crowd looked on. He spoke
softly, and although I could not hear I think he must have said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>My dear, you played your
part so very, very well.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
It must have taken a lot of courage, faith and prayers for that young girl to
walk out on stage, anxious to play her part well, when so many were depending
on her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since that memorable occasion I have replayed that scene in
my mind many times and contemplated the greeting we will each receive following
the final performance of our mortal life.Â  It won<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
matter if we play center stage, in the wings, or backstage. When Christ becomes
the very center of our life our performance will be Christlike, we will radiate
the light and live in anticipation of one day actually being <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>encircled in the arms of
his love.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[viii]</span></sup></sup></span></a>Â 
He waits for us <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>with
open arms.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[ix]</span></sup></sup></span></a>
Can we possibly begin to grasp the magnitude of that moment? The scripture
tells us, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>He employeth
no servant there.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[x]</span></sup></sup></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">THE LIGHT</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are two kinds of light. There is the physical light by
which we see, that can affect our moods and have a great impact even on our
physical health.Â  We know something of the clinical use of light, as in light
therapy.Â  But the light of which I speak is not subject to sunrise, sunset or
any weather condition.Â  It is not subject to disappointment, despair, or
distress.Â  This light can penetrate the darkest days and the heaviest storm
clouds in every season.Â  I speak of the spiritual light that is available to
each one of us. We read in the Doctrine and Covenants, <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth
light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth
brighter and brighter until the perfect day.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xi]</span></sup></sup></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We know that, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>...whatsoever
is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xii]</span></sup></sup></span></a> When you
and I went into the waters of baptism we covenanted to keep the commandments
and to stand as a witness for Christ at all times so we can <i>always</i> have
His spirit to be with us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">THAT THY LIGHT MAY BE AS A STANDARD</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We cannot be a brilliant light or even a modest light by
ourselves. We need help, and help is always available. King Benjamin explains
the challenge we face as mortals here on earth.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>For
the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and
will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy
Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the
atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek,
humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things the Lord seeth
fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xiii]</span></sup></sup></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When we willingly submit to the will of our Father in Heaven
and strive to follow the promptings we receive through the spirit, we can
expect some molding and shaping, refining, and cutting away. This can be difficult,
and yes, painful. The story is told of a great sculptor who worked hour after
hour in his studio carving, chipping, shaping, relentlessly cutting away day
after day. He seemed to be driven by a sense of mission. A young girl often
came by to watch.Â  One day during the process her eyes lit up as she exclaimed,
<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I know who that is!Â 
That is Abraham Lincoln! How did you know he was in there?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> Our Father in Heaven knows
us, knows what we have the capacity to become, and has a plan for us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When we willingly submit to the molding and shaping and to
some intense chipping away we will discover our divine destiny <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span> who, and whose, we really
are. The Prophet Joseph Smith, in describing his life of trials and tests said,
<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I am like a huge
rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is
when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else,
striking with accelerated force. . . knocking off a corner here and a corner
there.Â  Thus, I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the
Almighty.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xiv]</span></sup></sup></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our Father in Heaven has a plan to ensure our eternal
happiness if we choose to follow. And because he loves us he will smooth and
polish us with trials and tests, not to destroy us but to sanctify us.
Responding to the call to rise and shine we must seek the light in earnest
daily prayer.Â  There is great power in prayer. We will be receptive to the
prompting of the Holy Spirit by keeping the commandments. President Benson
explained, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>When
obedience ceases to be an irritant and becomes our quest, in that moment God
will endow us with power.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xv]</span></sup></sup></span></a>
We will be guided day by day in our foreordained mission. President George Q.
Cannon wrote, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>God has
chosen us out of the world and has given us a great mission. . . We were selected

<p class="MsoNormal">Does your responsibility seem overwhelming at times?Â  Or
does it awaken within you a realization, perhaps a memory of who you really are
and your capacity to make a difference in such a way that your light literally
will be a standard in your area of influence. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clearly, Satan desires to have us<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xvii]</span></sup></sup></span></a>
and wants to reinforce any feelings of inadequacy we may have. He seeks to
diminish our light, our righteous influence. We hesitate sometimes to open our
mouths; not because we are ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ but perhaps
because we sense a lack of ability to explain what we know and what we feel in
our hearts.Â  My sister Shirley wrote a few lines for her 11 children in poetic
preachment encouraging them to follow the Spirit with courage and conviction.
She tells them how:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Listen to your inner drummer,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Step to its quiet beat</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It has been said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>It
takes courage to take a stand when values are compromised for convenience and
popularity is preferred over principle.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
But stand we must, even if it requires standing alone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was in a Second Grade classroom while supervising student
teachers that I witnessed a magnificent example of a child who did actually
arise, and the room was literally filled with light.Â  Miss Nelson, the student
teacher, with all eyes on her, explained to the girls and boys that she was
going to read them a story about two different neighbors. After the story they
were to think about the characteristics of each neighbor and tell how they
felt.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>There
was a Mr. Brown<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>, she
began, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>the
friendliest man in town.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
She told in great detail how he knew everyone<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
name, including the children, and how he would make whistles out of willows and
knew the names of all the birds.Â  With a full description of Mr. Brown
implanted in the hearts and minds of the children she paused to change the mood
before reading about poor old Mr. Jones.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>He
had a very loud voice and would stand on the front porch and shake his fist and
yell when the children walked by. If they crossed his property he chased after
them, waving his cane.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
Closing the book she asked for their response.Â  Much discussion followed.Â 
Their enthusiastic comments gave evidence of their appreciation for Mr. Brown.Â 
With the lesson nearing completion, almost as an afterthought, Miss Nelson
posed a question: <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Who
would like to be a friend to Mr. Jones?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There was silence for a few moments, and it seemed that
there would be no response, until one little boy near the back row raised his
hand hesitantly.Â  Some of the students near him responded with a few childish
snickers.Â  The boy withdrew his hand ever so slightly, and hesitated an instant
as others joined in the snickering.Â  Then holding his hand steady he stretched
his arm full height and waited.Â  I glanced at Miss Nelson. She was obviously
unprepared for anyone to express interest in being a friend to Mr. Jones.Â  The
snickering continued but the young boy looked straight ahead with his arm held
high and his eyes on the teacher.Â  Something in that moment changed the mood.Â 
The snickering stopped and the teacher simply said, <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Jeff?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
He lowered his hand nervously, and with all eyes on him said hesitantly, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I wish Mr. Jones was my
neighbor. Because, if he was my neighbor my mom would make a pie for me to take
to him.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  He took his
eyes from the teacher, looked at the children <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>
his peers <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span> and added
with conviction, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>And
then he wouldn<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t be
that way anymore.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  A
hush fell over the room. I sensed the challenge of 22 second graders trying to
give meaning to what they had experienced.Â  And then almost as a benediction
the silence was broken by one child who whispered just barely loud enough for
all to hear, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I wish I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>d said that!<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That day in the Second Grade I learned lessons from a child
who for a moment became a master teacher. These lessons have served me well
through many intervening years, in circles of higher education, in settings of
considerable responsibilities, and in quiet contemplation. The following four
lessons remain paramount:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Level1">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Dare to stand alone when you know in your heart it is right.</i>Â 
Logic and reason may not always be reliable but a spirit that connects to the
divine source is.Â  A child in a classroom, a youth reaching for popularity and
approval, or an adult facing a personal, family, or community issue can know
what is right.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Level1">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Believe in people and believe they can change.</i>Â  It may take aÂ 
pie or some other intervention, but it is possible.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Level1">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>You cannot change the whole world, but your influence can change the
world in which you live.</i> Change can happen if you are willing to leave your
comfort zone and set aside your need for the approval of the group.Â  An
atmosphere of ridicule and doubt can be changed to an atmosphere of reverence
by the voice of one.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Level1">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Others seeking truth will follow.Â  When you have courage to speak truth
some will whisper, if not out loud then within their hearts, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I wish I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>d said that!<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> then go a better way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>m
impressed by the words of Joan of Arc in the play <i>Joan of Lorraine</i> by
Maxwell Anderson. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">She says, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I
know this now, every man gives his life for what he believes.Â  Every woman
gives her life for what she believes.Â  Sometimes people believe in little or
nothing.Â  One life is all we have.Â  We live it as we believe in living it, and
then it<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s gone.Â  But
to surrender what you are and live without belief, that<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s more terrible than dying.Â  More terrible
than dying young.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
The question is not what we are willing to die for but rather what we are
willing to live for.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">TRIALS AND TESTS CAN INCREASE THE LIGHT</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes the journey is difficult, very difficult, but the
Lord has promised the light will come: <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Behold,
I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I
will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xviii]</span></sup></sup></span></a>
Could it ever be that He would knock and we would not open the door? Perhaps we
cannot hear the knock because the voices of despair, discouragement and
disappointment drown out the whisperings of the spirit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I vividly remember a very difficult time in my own life
years ago. It was Thanksgiving Day. The image of Thanksgiving in my mind
pictured large happy families everywhere gathered around bounteous tables with
children and grandchildren and parents and grandparents and joy inexpressable,
the future bright. With the reality of only two plates on our Thanksgiving
table, no family near and no children, the room seemed dark. The light was
fading rapidly. I learned on that occasion and many others since that when we
invite Him in to sup with us we need never eat alone. Our tables are laden and
the room is filled with light. We can feast in a spiritual banquet even as we
hunger for blessings not yet realized. And then like a personal <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>letter from home<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> we hear in our minds and
hearts the promise: <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>And
if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with
light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled
with light comprehendeth all things.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xix]</span></sup></sup></span></a>
We begin to see things differently. We see the hand of the Lord in our lives.
We learn to trust in the Lord with all our hearts and not lean on our own
understanding.<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xx]</span></sup></sup></span></a> Then we can
help light the way for others.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CONTENDING AGAINST EVIL</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Suppose in our response to the call to hold up our light in
this ever-darkening world our united effort would be as powerful as the efforts
of the early pioneers when the black crickets were killing their tender crops.Â 
They united together, shoulder to shoulder, and when they had given their all
the Lord sent the seagulls. Like the crickets, the evils of our day attack our
youth, our tender, impressionable youth. Suppose we were to make a pledge to do
all within our power to rid ourselves of the black crickets of our day, the
evil influences in our lives.Â  Suppose there was no compromise, no
justification, no excuses to tolerate any enticement of the world in our
entertainment or other activities that would lessen the spirit. Let us strive
every day to avoid anything and everything that could weaken our spirit and
extinguish the light. We must simply give it up, turn our backs, and walk away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Suppose we shared the same dedication to future generations
as expressed by Vilate Raile, a Mormon pioneer:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">They cut desire into short lengths</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">And fed it to the hungry fires of
courage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Long after, when the flames had
died,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Molten gold gleamed in the ashes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">They gathered it into bruised palms</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">And handed it to their children</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">And their children<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s children</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Forever.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I thrill with the words of President George Q. Cannon
concerning any confrontation with evil. <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>When
Satan comes and assails us, it is our privilege to say, <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>&gt;</span>Get thee behind me, Satan, for I have no
lot nor portion in you, and you have no part in me. I am in the service of God,
and I am going to serve Him, and you can do what you please. It is no use you

<p class="MsoNormal">We are placed here as free agents to develop our divine
nature.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>If we were
not surrounded by darkness,<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
explained President Cannon, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>we
could not develop. . . Good and evil must be presented before us. . .Â  We are

<p class="MsoNormal">President John Taylor indicated that our physical senses,
our <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>faculties,<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> have been given to us to
enable our spirits to learn physical things more quickly and accurately.Â  He
stated, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>If I had time
to enter into this subject alone I could show you upon scientific principles
that man himself is a self-registering machine, his eyes, his ears, his nose,
the touch, the taste, and all the various senses of the body, are so many media
whereby man lays up for himself a record which perhaps nobody else is
acquainted with but himself.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xxiii]</span></sup></sup></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We choose what we expose our faculties to by way of sights,
sounds, thoughts and feelings, but the consequences of our choices are fixed.
And when we choose the right we hunger and thirst after righteousness.Â  But if
the conduit for the spirit becomes polluted by what we choose to expose our
minds to and the light goes out, the hunger and thirst for the things of the
world can become an enslaving addiction.Â  Can we be casual about what we expose
our minds to?Â  King Benjamin, in one of his last great addresses looking
forward to our time warned, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>And
finally, I cannot tell you all things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are
divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.Â  But this much I
can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your
words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God...even unto the end
of your lives, ye must perish...<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xxiv]</span></sup></sup></span></a>Â 
The light will dim, and will gradually die out.Â  It has been said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>In the armory of thought
[man] forges the weapons by which he destroys himself.<span style='font-family:

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An old Navaho was telling his grandson, as the story goes,
about a fight that was going on inside himself. He said it was between two
wolves.Â  One is evil, anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, self-pity, arrogance,
resentment, inferiority, superiority and so on.Â  The other is good, joy, peace,
love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness and empathy.Â  The grandson thought
about this and asked, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Which
wolf wins?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  The
simple reply: <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>The one
I feed.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yes, the one we feed.Â  While some of us are concerned with
regulating diet to control cholesterol, others count fat grams and calories as
if life itself depended on it. We should be more concerned with our spiritual
diet, since our eternal lives do in fact depend on it!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The growth of God<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
kingdom in these latter days is commensurate with the faithful followers of
Christ who hold the line.Â  Every effort to seek the light, follow the light, be
the light and share the light will shine through every act of service, every
truth taught, every commandment obeyed, every resistance to evil, every effort
to share the gospel and every prayer. When no one is watching our performance
and there is no public applause, in the still quiet moments we will feel our
Heavenly Father<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
approval. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Without a true sense of our spiritual identity we can be
overcome by relating our feelings of worth to our appearance, our performance
and other peoples opinions.Â  If we use these worldly standards our days will
always look dark.Â  I will never forget the day in the beauty shop where the
hairdresser with a strong accent stepped back to examine her work, looked at me
and said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>ll bet you were really
pretty when you were young!<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>m
comforted by the words of Elder John Groberg:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">If there were any eternal value to
earthly wealth or position or title or income or physical beauty or prowess,
then God would be a partial God, which He specifically says He is not. But
there is no value to these things. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">What then is the common denominator
that covers all men and all women over all time and all circumstances? The

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">ORDINANCES AND COVENANTS</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With a sincere desire and commitment to arise and shine
forth that our light may be a standard for the nations we will be drawn to the
light that comes through the ordinances and covenants of the temple. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Packer reminds us, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>In
the temple we face the sunlight of truth. The light of the temple, that
understanding, shines upon us as does the light of the sun. And the shadows of
sin and ignorance and error, of disappointment and failure, fall behind us.
Nowhere quite equals the temple.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xxvii]</span></sup></sup></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the past two and a half years Brother Kapp and I have had
the opportunity to spend much time in the temple. I have had my eyes opened and
my understanding increased as never before. I have a deeper sense of the
magnitude and the vastness and eternal nature of the ordinances and covenants
available in the temple. It is through the covenants made in the temple we find
our greatest source of light and knowledge and power. It is in the ordinances
of the temple we begin to more fully comprehend the very purpose of this
earthly journey and the great plan of happiness. We learn of our divine
inheritance as a child of God and our potential as an eternal being.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the temple we learn to see things differently. Our values
change. The light of the temple helps us gain an eternal perspective. Our
covenant relationship with the Savior strengthens our desire and our commitment
to arise and shine forth. We know that we can do better than we have ever done
before.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The grandest blessing of the temple is the sealing power
that unites families.Â  It has been said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>The
marriage relationship, more than any other because it is more intimate, more
constant, more important, is our greatest spiritual challenge and has the
greatest potential along with parenthood, to make us godlike.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  I have found it most
effective to use a challenging experience to tutor ourselves rather than to
coach our partner.Â  The challenge is not to train our companion but to train
ourselves to focus on what is right rather than what is wrong, intent on fixing
the relationship rather than fixing the blame.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Satan is real.Â  His influence is real.Â  The battle is raging
and evil influences are marshaled to create contention, conflict,
misunderstanding and miscommunication, and to use every effort to weaken the
husband and wife relationship and destroy families. And if that happens the
enemy scores a victory, and he laughs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">President Ezra Taft Benson promised, <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>[The] temple will be a standing witness that
the power of God can stay the powers of evil in our midst... There is a power

blessings.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xxviii]</span></sup></sup></span></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Elder John A. Widstoe gave us this promise: <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Spiritual power is

spirit enlightens, cheers, and comforts every member of the household. The
peace we covet is found in such homes.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xxix]</span></sup></sup></span></a>
It is little wonder that the First Presidency, in a letter dated March 11,
2003, asked, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Where
time and circumstances permit, members are encouraged to replace some leisure
activities with temple service.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xxx]</span></sup></sup></span></a>Â

<p class="MsoNormal">In the temple we learn more of the great plan of happiness
and our reason for unwavering hope.Â  We learn of the promises in relation to
our covenants and we feel God<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
binding love.Â  We might feel as five year old Adam James did when his father
asked, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Adam do you
know Heavenly Father loves you?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
Without hesitation he responded, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Yes.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>How
do you know?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  his
father asked.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>He
tells me in my mind to know.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The conversation continues. <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>But

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>What

know?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The child spoke again the truth he could feel.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>He tells me in my mind to
know.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are times when that assurance is absolutely essential
if our light is to shine as we face the trials and tests which are the very
purpose for this mortal life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of temple work President Boyd K. Packer wrote, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>No work is more spiritually
refining. No work we do gives us more power. No work requires a higher standard
of righteousness. Our labors in the temple cover us with a shield and a
protection, both individually and as a people.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xxxi]</span></sup></sup></span></a>
What price would you pay to insure these temple blessings for you and your
posterity?Â  You might ponder the question, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>How
far do I live from the temple?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
I don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t mean in miles
or kilometers or minutes or hours. Someone living thousands of miles from a
temple, who honors the covenants made in the temple, may live closer than
someone who lives across the street.Â  The distance to the temple is not
measured in miles or minutes, but in priorities and commitment and
preparation.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I witnessed the power and effectiveness of early preparation
for the temple this past year. The Primary theme, as you may remember, was <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I Love to See the Temple, I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>m Going There Someday<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>. I had the opportunity to
speak with many, many children in small groups and to learn from them.Â  Now I
want to tell you, <i>there</i> is a place to see a command performance of those
willing to arise and shine!Â  There is a light that emanates from such a
gathering, not so much in what you see, but in what you feel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This past year we received letters from primary children
from as far away as Brazil asking about our temple. Their questions were
varied. One astute young man wanted to know the reason the Cardston Temple does
not have an angel Moroni on top. <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Is
it because you have low flying planes?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
A thoughtful inquiry for a young boy.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Addressing one group of children I asked, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>How are you preparing to
come to the temple?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
Their arms shot straight in the air, eager to tell.Â  One child on the front row
with his arm straight in the air exploded with this wisdom: <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Don<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t drink Coke!<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
Another gave additional wisdom, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t eat bad stuff<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>, and another, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Do what is right no matter
what!<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> I was told that
one child, when asked if his whole family kept the word of wisdom, responded
regretfully, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>All but
grandpa. He puts tobacco sauce on his food.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then I asked, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>How
many of you are preparing and looking forward to coming to the temple and being
married in the temple?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
Every hand went up.Â  I asked them, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>How
many of you are trying to be obedient?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
Once again a unanimous response.Â  One more question. <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>What do you do to be obedient?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  A quick answer, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Do what your mom says.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> Is it any wonder we are to
become <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>even as a
child,<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xxxii]</span></sup></sup></span></a>
as the scripture teaches us? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a child in Primary I remember standing and singing with
my whole heart and soul, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Jesus
wants me for a sunbeam, to shine for him each day.<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xxxiii]</span></sup></sup></span></a> I
remember feeling like he really needed me. And I remember how I felt deep
inside singing, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>ll be a sunbeam for him,<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xxxiv]</span></sup></sup></span></a>
and feeling, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I can,
if I but try.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> He
still needs us, brothers and sisters, to shine for him each and every day. I
know that we can if we but try. He will magnify our efforts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We may never carry the light, the flame, the fire of the
Olympic torch with the world looking on. But let us be a bright and burning
flame as we pass the cleansing light of Christ to every nation through every
generation when we do our part with the same conviction and enthusiasm as these
children.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">OUR COMMITMENT</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The light from the temple is passed from one generation to
the next through those who arise and shine forth, who take a stand and make a
commitment to endure whatever difficulty or hardship is required.Â  May it be
recorded for generations to come that during our brief time of trial and test
in this earth life experience that we did arise and shine forth fearlessly,
courageously, and boldly. President Hinckley in a voice of warning for our day
tells us, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>You cannot
simply take for granted this cause, which is the cause of Christ.Â  You cannot
simply stand on the sidelines and watch the play between the forces of good and
evil.Â  Said Nephi, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>&gt;</span>They
who are not for me are against me, saith our God.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As we go forth from this gathering I<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>m impressed with the words of Rachel Naomi Remen:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Days pass and the years vanish and we
walk sightless among miracles.Â  Lord, fill our eyes with seeing and our minds
with knowing.Â  Let there be moments when your Presence, like lightening,
illuminates the darkness in which we walk.Â  Help us to see, wherever we gaze,
that the bush burns, unconsumed.Â  And we, clay touched by God, will reach out
for holiness and exclaim in wonder, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>How
filled with awe is this place and we did not know it.<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt">[xxxvii]</span></sup></sup></span></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When we are committed to give all we have with faith in the
Lord Jesus Christ, His light will shine through us. And we will be filled with
awe at the opportunities to influence and to lift others. In the words of Emily
Dickenson,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">We never know how high we are</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I bear witness from a lifetime of experience that God lives.
He is our Father. We are his children. Jesus Christ is our Savior and our

<p class="MsoNormal">I am so happy to be here at BYU-Idaho for Education Week.Â  I
have great admiration for those who seek to take advantage of learning
opportunities during the Â“lazy, hazy days of summer and fun.Â” Being here on
campus reminds me that I never did quite conquer the art of attending school
during the summer. I had two experiences trying to mix summer and education.Â 
My first was as a single student trying to fall in love and take sociology. I
received my lowest grade on record. My second attempt at summer school was at
BYU-Provo.Â  As a wife and mother of two, I was on a fast track to complete a
masterÂ’s degree. I borrowed my dadÂ’s car, with no air-conditioning, for the
summer, and drove from our home in Salt Lake to Provo three days a week.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I arrived home on the last day of making that hot trek in
the 5:30 p.m. stop-and-go traffic, I was suffering from heat exhaustion. My
husband had to help me get out of the car.Â  When he experienced the heat in the
car, he investigated and discovered that the heater had been stuck on high for
the entire hot summer.Â  I admire you for your efforts at summer learning.Â  You
have gathered with eagerness to learn at this season of the year and in all
seasons of your life.Â  You truly are examples of the theme for this yearÂ’s
Education Week, Â“Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for
the nations.Â”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[1]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When President Gordon B. Hinckley visited the BYU-Idaho
campus last October he said:Â  Â“I pray the Lord will smile with favor upon you.Â 
I pray that your days may be happy and rich with the experience of learning.Â  I
pray that your faith may be nourished.Â”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[2]</span></span></a>Â  What a mighty gift
for a living prophet of God to pray such blessings upon those who attend here
at BYU-Idaho, and I believe that<u> </u>also includes those who attend
Education Week here on this campus. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Today, June 27<sup>th</sup>, marks the 159<sup>th</sup> year
since the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1844.Â  It is the date on
which Joseph Smith sealed with his blood his testimony that the heavens are
open.Â  President Hinckley chose June 27, 2002, as the date for the dedication
of the restored Nauvoo Illinois Temple.Â  President Hinckley desires for us to
gain a testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Restoration of the gospel
of Jesus Christ. It all began with a simple, yet mighty prayer of a young boy.Â 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My focus during this next hour will be on prophets, prayers,
and promised blessings.Â  For some, this focus on prayer will confirm what you
already know and feel about the promised blessings of prayer.Â  For others of
us, it will be an opportunity to examine our understanding and testimony of
prayer. This can be a time to ponder questions such as:Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What can I learn from Joseph SmithÂ’s experience with prayer?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How can my prayers be more meaningful?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How do I know when prayers are answered?Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What are some of the promised blessings of prayer?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Primary, teachers give children opportunities to share
their feelings about what they are learning.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A teacher might ask Primary children to share their feelings
about Â“Why do we pray?Â” or Â“What are some of the blessings we receive from
prayers?Â” Or a teacher might ask the children to tell about a time when their
prayer was answered.Â  The class today is too large for us to share our personal
experiences, yet you may wish to make a note of the impressions you receive
about prayer, especially your personal prayers.Â  As I became more focused on prayer
these last few weeks, I started writing some thoughts in a notebook I keep by
my bedside.Â  A little later, I would like to share some of the impressions I
recorded. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Purpose of Prayer</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before we came to this earth, we lived in the presence of
our Heavenly Father.Â  We saw His face and heard His voice.Â  We knew His plan
and His will for us.Â  Leaving His presence must have been difficult for us.Â  It
is a great comfort to know that even though we are no longer in His physical
presence, we can still feel His love and receive His counsel through prayer.Â 
As Elder Russell M. Nelson reminds us, Â“We may pray to Him any time.Â  No
special equipment is needed.Â  We donÂ’t even need to charge batteries or pay a
monthly service fee.Â”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[3]</span></span></a> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Prayer is one of the first and most often repeated commands
given by God to men.Â  One of the first commandments God gave Adam and Eve was
Â“that they should worship the Lord their God.Â”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[4]</span></span></a>
Adam and Eve Â“called upon the name of the Lord, and they heard the voice of the
Lord.Â”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[5]</span></span></a>Â 
And they Â“ ceased not to call upon God.Â”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[6]</span></span></a>
Abraham prayed, Moses prayed, and so did prophets of all dispensations. Elder
David E. Sorensen teaches, Â“Prayer is the defining act of the worshipper of God
the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.Â”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[7]</span></span></a>Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Learning about Prayer from Joseph Smith and Other
Prophets</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We can learn valuable lessons about the power and the
blessings of prayer as we study the experiences and teachings of the prophets.Â 
Through the Prophet Joseph SmithÂ’s experience, we learn the relationship
between our Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ.Â  This knowledge was
restored when Joseph lifted his voice to heaven.Â  He was answered by the
appearance of the Father, who introduced His Son and invited Joseph to Â“hear
Him.Â”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[8]</span></span></a>Â 
When we pray, we acknowledge that the Father provided His Son as the Redeemer
of the world. We call upon the Father in the name of the Son because the Son
provided our actual redemption from the Fall.Â  He, the Son, suffered for us,
died for us, and broke the bands of death for us, thus becoming our Advocate
with the Father.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[9]</span></span></a> Christ is the
master and exemplifier of prayer.Â  His prayer to His Father in Gethsemane is an
incomprehensible pleading for strength to proceed with the work of the infinite
and eternal Atonement. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After His great intercessory prayer and after His
resurrection, He still prayed to the Father, as described in 3 Nephi: Â“He . . .
knelt upon the earth; and behold He prayed unto the Father. . . .Â Â  Neither
hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard
Jesus speak unto the Father; and no tongue can speak, neither can there be
written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and
marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive
of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard Him pray for us unto the
Father.Â”<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[10]</span></span></a>Â 
This record of Jesus Christ praying to His Father in Heaven gives us a glimpse
of the glory and joy Joseph Smith must have experienced when he received
answers to his prayer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Eyring states: Â“Joseph SmithÂ’s mission was unique, yet
his humble prayer can be a helpful model for us.Â  He began . . . with faith in
a loving God who can and wants to communicate with us and help us. That faith
was rooted in impressions which came to him as he pondered the words of GodÂ’s
servants in the scriptures.Â”<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[11]</span></span></a> JosephÂ’s prayer
recognized that our loving Heavenly Father hears us, knows us, and answers our
prayers.Â  Think of how different Joseph SmithÂ’s prayers were from that day
forward. He had seen God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. He had spoken
with Them, he knew They were real. He had felt the power of the Spirit and
received a witness of the truth. From that moment on his prayers must have had
a new intensity since he now understood the Father and the SonÂ’s relationship
to each other and his relationship to Them. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If there are times when you doubt the Father is listening
and that He answers prayers, remember the Primary song Â“A ChildÂ’s Prayer.Â” </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â“Heavenly Father, are you really there?Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And do you hear and answer evÂ’ry childÂ’s prayer?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some say that heaven is far away, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But I feel it close around me as I pray.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Heavenly Father, I remember now</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Something that Jesus told disciples long ago: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â“Suffer the children to come to me.Â”Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Father, in prayer IÂ’m coming now to thee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pray, He is there; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Speak He is listÂ’ning. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You are His child; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His love now surrounds you.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He hears your prayer; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He loves the children.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of such is the kingdom, the kingdom of heaven.Â”<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[12]</span></span></a>Â 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A Primary president was so impressed with a three-year-oldÂ’s
prayer during Primary opening exercises that she sought out the parents and
asked them how they taught their daughter to offer such a heart-felt prayer.Â 
The father said they teach her that Heavenly Father is real and she is His spirit
child.Â  There is a reason why the first lesson in the <i>Primary One Manual</i>
is Â“I Am a Child of GodÂ” and the first song in the <i>ChildrenÂ’s Songbook</i>
is Â“I Am a Child of God.Â” In the Bible Dictionary we read, Â“As soon as we learn
the true relationship in which we stand toward God (namely, God is our Father,
and we are his children), then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive
on our part.Â”<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[13]</span></span></a> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Four-year-old Jacob had completed six of the seven steps in
his routine for going to bed.Â  If you are a young mother you know what those
seven steps areÂ–have a snack, brush the teeth, read two story books, give
everyone in the family a kiss, get a drink of water, listen to a parent read
from the scriptures, and then kneel down and say prayers.Â  In an effort to help
Jacob say a more meaningful prayer, his exhausted mother attempted to remind
him of what he might say in his prayer.Â  JacobÂ’s response was, Â“Mommy, my heart
tells me what to say and I just say it.Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>More Meaningful Prayer</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord declares, Â“Call upon me in mighty prayer.Â”<span class="EndnoteRefe"> <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[14]</span></a></span>Â 
How do we pray mightily?Â  It is the Spirit that makes prayer Â“mighty prayer.Â”Â 
The Apostle Paul teaches, Â“For we know not what we should pray for as we
ought:Â  but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which
cannot be uttered.Â”<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[15]</span></span></a>Â  As we persist in
daily prayer, we gradually become aware that the Spirit is prompting us, not
only in how and what to pray for, but also in what the Lord wants for us. We
are promised, Â“He that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of
God; wherefore it is done even as he asketh.Â”<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[16]</span></span></a>Â 
Think about how we teach a young child to pray.Â  We whisper in his ear what we
think he needs, and the child in faith repeats back the words.Â  We can know the
words to say as we listen to the promptings of the Spirit.Â  The Bible
Dictionary states, Â“The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but
to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to
grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them.Â”<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[17]</span></span></a>Â 
Joseph Smith prayed continually for the LordÂ’s guidance in establishing and
building up the kingdom of God on earth.Â  His desires were the desires of the
Father and the Son. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes it is hard to feel we are growing in our ability
to offer mighty prayers. Â We offer what one child called a Â“mealtime prayerÂ”
instead of a personal, intimate prayer. Have you ever had the desire to get
away from the world and contemplate how to develop a greater spiritual
connection with the Father and His Son?Â Â  Joseph Smith must have had an Â“ah-haÂ”
when he translated the words of Enos, in Book of Mormon.Â  Surely he remembered
his own experience in the grove and again felt as Enos did,Â  Â“And my soul
hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto Him in mighty prayer
and supplication for mine own soul.Â”<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[18]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many times I have desired to have an experience like Enos.Â 
I have gone for long walks and spent quiet, prayerful time at home alone with
the desire to increase my ability to offer more heartfelt prayers.Â  I have come
to realize that it is not about a one-time mighty prayer.Â  It is about making a
commitment to pray daily with sufficient desire and effort to communicate with
increased faith, obedience and love. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, pleaded
with us in April general conference, Â“that each of us will seek to live closer
to the Lord and to commune with Him more frequently and with increased faith.Â”<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[19]</span></span></a>Â 
It would be well if we all examine our daily prayers and determine if we need
to extend the intensity of our efforts in calling on the powers and blessings
of heaven. President Hinckley said: Â“The trouble with most of our prayers is
that we give them as if we were picking up the telephone and ordering
groceriesÂ–we place our order and hang up.Â  We need to meditate . . . and then
speak to the Lord as one man speaketh to another.Â”<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[20]</span></span></a>Â 
Learning to commune with the Lord is an ability we will need throughout
eternity.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are times in all our lives when we are praying with
regularity, but more as a matter of habit than desire.Â  Our thoughts are on
other things and places, our communication is inattentive, our hearts are not
centered upon prayer, and our words are perfunctory.Â  We know we can and should
do better.Â  It is not about making prayers longer or more difficult.Â  It is
about making the simple act of prayer more meaningful as an act of faith and
worship. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Think about your prayer this morning.Â  What did you pray
for?Â  We are counseled in the scriptures to pray for all things in
righteousness, whether temporal or spiritual. Amulek speaks of crops and herds,
of fields and flocks, as well as of mercy and salvation.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[21]</span></span></a>Â 
Nephi says, Â“Ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first
place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will
consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the
welfare of thy soul.Â”<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class="MsoNormal">President Hinckley counseled us in April general conference
to pray for our children Â“that they may be shielded from the evils of the
world, . . . that they may be directed toward lives that will be profitable and
good.Â”<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[23]</span></span></a>Â 
He encouraged husbands to pray for their wives and wives to pray for their
husbands.Â  He said to pray for peace in the earth, to pray for the weather, and
to pray for wisdom and understanding.Â  Â“Let us be a prayerful people.Â”<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[24]</span></span></a>Â 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We learn from the Lord, Himself, not only how to pray, but
also what to pray for. On one occasion when the LordÂ’s disciples asked Him to
teach them to pray, the Lord gave them what we know as the LordÂ’s Prayer and
said, Â“After this manner therefore pray ye.Â”<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[25]</span></span></a>
This prayer was not given to those who were unlearned in prayer.Â  Prayer was
part of the Jewish tradition from Adam down through the generations.Â  Many of
us know the LordÂ’s Prayer by heart.Â  Why do you think we memorized this prayer
when the Lord has said,Â  Â“Use not vain repetitions, as the heathen doÂ”?<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[26]</span></span></a>Â 
I think the LordÂ’s Prayer is an example to help us utter our own words with
sincere and real intent. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As we read and ponder the LordÂ’s Prayer, uttered by Christ,
we will receive guidance from the Spirit in formulating our own prayers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â“<i>Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy nameÂ”<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[27]</span></b></span></a></i>
reminds us how to address our Heavenly Father using the reverent and hallowed
language of prayer.Â Â  This language includes the use of the words <i>thy,
thine, thee</i>, and <i>thou</i> in addressing Deity, rather than <i>you, your,</i>
and <i>yours</i>.Â  The language we use to address God mirrors the devotion and
respect of our hearts and minds.Â  When parents and others pray using hallowed language,
children are taught through example how our language shows respect. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Â“Thy kingdom come.Â  Thy will be done, in earth, as it is

Satan, in contrast, sought to destroy the agency the Lord had given men, and
thus to take all power.Â  In prayer, we recognize the plan of salvation and
express our acceptance of not only the plan, but also the Restoration of the
gospel of Jesus Christ. We express appreciation for living prophets and other
priesthood leaders and the opportunity to sustain them by word and deed as we
work together to build Zion. We pray for those who serve us, such as our bishop
and priesthood and auxiliary leaders.Â  Â We pray for help and effectiveness in
our individual callings, including as a home teacher or a Relief Society
visiting teacher. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We give appreciation for our family relationships and
express our desire for our homes to be as heaven on earth.Â Â  We ask that we
will be sensitive to opportunities to love and serve one another. The Lord
hears our prayers in behalf of our family and others.Â  One Sunday, a few days
before a copy of my conference talk was to be submitted, I received a phone
call from a granddaughter, nine-year-old Katie.Â  She said, Â“Grandmother Dear
(that is my requested title), our family has been fasting and praying that you
will be able to write your conference talk.Â  Is your talk done?Â  I am so
hungry.Â  Is it OK if I end my fast now?Â”Â  I felt great peace about my
unfinished conference talk, because I knew from that moment KatieÂ’s prayer
would be answered.</p>

</i>reminds us to pray for what we need, recognizing that Heavenly Father knows
what we need before we ask Him.Â  So why do we need to ask?Â  Because we have the
gift of agency. Prayer is an act of faith. We seek for the bread of eternal
life, Jesus Christ, and to be His disciple.Â  We seek to acquire greater charity
that we might obtain Christlike attributes.Â  A friend shared with me that she
was awakened one Saturday morning at 5 a.m. by the sounds of her next-door
neighbors preparing for a garage sale.Â  If that early hour wasnÂ’t bad enough,
some of the sale items were spilling over onto her front lawn.Â  As the morning
progressed, her street and driveway filled with cars.Â  For her, the worst part,
other than being awakened so early, was watching the tender grass on her front
lawn being trampled. In a huff, she approached her neighbor to declare the
injustice of it all. She had expected to receive insensitive excuses, but
instead she learned that this family was holding a fundraiser for a charity.Â 
She joined the sale by contributing from her own personal funds to support this
good cause.Â  As we pray daily for guidance, we will be more inclined to make
noble assumptions about the intentions of others. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Â“And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtorsÂ”<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[31]</span></b></span></a></i>
teaches us to pray for forgiveness of our sins, transgressions, and weaknesses.
Remember, Enos began his mighty prayer by reflecting on his relationship with
the Lord and being determined to obtain a remission of his sins. We know Joseph
Smith prayed for forgiveness of his sins.Â  In a revelation given to Joseph
Smith, the Lord said, Â“Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, . . . whose arm of
mercy hath atoned for your sins.Â”<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From the Joseph Smith Translation we read, <i>Â“And suffer us
not to be led into temptation, but deliver us from evil.Â”<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[33]</span></b></span></a>
</i>We are taught to pray for the strength to resist temptation.Â  I had a few
close calls as a youth, times when there was clear and present danger for my
spiritual well-being.Â  I know it was those late night prayers by my parents
that called down the powers of heaven to protect and guide me to maintain the
standards that I now teach with testimony to my own children.Â  There are times
when all we can do is pray.Â  It is our first and last resort.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We also pray for strength and comfort to be sustained in
troubled times. When our trials seem like tragedies, we can remember the
experience of Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail.Â  He received a test of faith as he
pleaded to know the purpose of the tribulations he and the Saints were
experiencing.Â  His answer was, Â“Know thou, my son, that all these things shall
give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.Â”<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[34]</span></span></a>Â 
Like Joseph Smith, we may wonder where peace is to be found during times of
awful sorrow, pain, and discouragement. We may wonder, at least for a moment,
if it is worth it.Â  Darkness enters, thick dense darkness, and doubt invites
darkness to stay.Â  I, like many of you, have pleaded for light and comfort when
these experiences touch our lives and the lives of others, especially when they
come in multiples.Â  Comfort comes from prayer when we understand the source of
our comfortÂ–our relationship with a loving Heavenly Father and the Atonement
and mercy of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Â“For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,
for ever.Â”<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[35]</span></b></span></a></i>Â 
Our desire is to glorify God and to submit to the will of our Father as we
eliminate pride and impure motives from our lives.Â  In the words of Joseph
Smith, we join all of GodÂ’s creation to glorify and praise God: Â“Let the
mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry
lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King! . . . And let the eternal
creations declare his name forever and ever!Â”<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[36]</span></span></a>Â 
(Can you tell this is one of my favorite scriptures?)Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By following the example of the LordÂ’s Prayer, our prayers
will become more meaningful. Meaningful prayer requires real effort and real
faith.Â  We prepare our minds and hearts for prayer by studying the scriptures,
obeying His commandments, improving our loving relationships with others,
fasting, pondering, and contemplating the beauty and wonder of GodÂ’s creations.<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[37]</span></span></a>Â 
A mission president had the tradition of interviewing his missionaries and
asking, Â“When did you have your last spiritual experience?Â”Â  The answers
varied, but one missionaryÂ’s answer was unique. He replied, Â“This morning, when
. . . I prayed.Â”Â  This mission president said, Â“. . . I did not doubt his word,
for I knew of his commitment, his spiritual nature, and his ability to pray.Â”<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[38]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recognizing Answers to Prayer</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Believe in the power of prayer.Â  Pray with the expectation
that prayers will be answered. Some of us have received a calling in the Church
that required us to identify counselors to serve with.Â  Such an experience
requires learning the LordÂ’s willÂ—learning whom He has selected to serve
together.Â  When President Hinckley issued the call for me to serve as the
Primary general president, he also instructed me to ask the Lord whom He wanted
to serve in this presidency. I was given counsel to learn the LordÂ’s will and
the responsibility to report back within a few days.Â Â  I trusted the Lord would
reveal through the Holy Spirit those He desired to be called, but I also knew I
would need to prepare to receive such revelation.Â  I prayed I might live worthy
of such communication through the Spirit.Â  After fasting, praying, pondering
the scriptures, and attending the temple, a counselorÂ’s name came as a direct
message to my mind and heart.Â  The other counselorÂ’s name came to my mind even
as I was leaving President HinckleyÂ’s office, but I thought that seemed too
immediate.Â  I doubted, so I searched for a stronger impression.Â  I waited for a
more miraculous experience.Â  While reading the scriptures, I received the
message to Â“be still, and know,Â”<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[39]</span></span></a> for I had been
told.<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[40]</span></span></a>Â Â 
This experience was a another witness to me that the Lord does reveal His will
in His own way to those He calls, and to each of us as we seek to know. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Scott teaches, Â“When we receive help from our Father
in Heaven, it is in response to faith<u>, </u>obedience, and the proper use of
agency.Â”<a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[41]</span></span></a>Â 
Â“Sometimes He answers yes, sometimes no.Â  Often He withholds an answer, not for
lack of concern, but because He loves usÂ–perfectly.Â  He wants us to apply
truths He has given us.Â  For us to grow, we need to trust our ability to make
correct decisions.Â  We need to do what we <i>feel</i> is right.Â  In time, He
will answer. He will not fail us. . . .Â  He is conscious of our every need and
could provide all the answers.Â  Yet, because His purpose is our eternal
happiness, He encourages us to make the correct choices.Â”<a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[42]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Eyring reminds us, Â“With . . . faith, we will be able
to pray for what we want and appreciate whatever we get.Â”<a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[43]</span></span></a>
We live in a world of instant resolution.Â  We have fast and faster food, fast
and faster Internet service, fast and faster service from drive-through and
pick-up cleaners to pharmacies.Â  When prayers are not answered immediately in a
seemingly drive-through, pick-up manner, we can become discouraged.Â  We may
expect our prayers to be answered before or while we are asking.Â  Even Adam and
Eve received answers only, Â“after many daysÂ” of praying and offering
sacrifices.<a href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[44]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember that before JosephÂ’s prayer was answered a darkness
came over him.Â  In his words:Â  Â“I was seized upon by some power, which entirely
overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue
so that I could not speak.Â  Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to
me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.Â”<a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[45]</span></span></a>Â 
That could have been the end of his experience except for what happened next.Â 
Joseph reports: Â“Exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of
the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I
was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destructionÂ– . . . just at
this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above
the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.Â”<a href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[46]</span></span></a>
Often just before the light, the uncertainty tempts us to surrender.</p>
<p class="WP9BodyTex"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Several years ago, after the birth of our fifth child, I
experienced numbness in my face and lost the ability to close one eye.Â  Within
a few days, two specialists diagnosed my condition as BellÂ’s palsy.Â  It was not
physically painful; in fact, it was the numbness that was the problem.Â  I
suffered from a prideful pain.Â  My face was distorted and I could not smile on
one side.Â  Friends and family came to see our precious new baby, and I stayed
in the bedroom out of sight, embarrassed because one side of my face had
fallen. I became more and more self-conscious and more and more focused on me.Â 
I wanted an instant cure. Many prayers were offered for my recovery. I received
a priesthood blessing, but the days passed and there was no change.Â  Others
shared stories of people they knew with BellÂ’s palsy.Â  All I could remember
were the stories about people who did not recover and had to endure the
permanent loss of their smile.Â  I felt the darkness of despair. I struggled to
move beyond the pride of appearance and accept this trial.Â  Over time and with
patience and long suffering, my muscle tone returned to almost normal, but the
lesson of accepting what the Lord has designed for me has stayed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are times when we are part of the answer to someone
elseÂ’s prayer.Â  Malorie, a second-grade student, had completed her homework but
had misplaced it.Â Â  Her mother suggested that she practice her piano and then
they would search for the homework papers.Â  After a few minutes, the music
stopped and MalorieÂ’s mother went looking for her daughter.Â  She found Malorie
in her bedroom on her knees.Â  She could hear Malorie praying to find her lost
homework.Â  MalorieÂ’s mother became worried and began to pray herself.Â  Â“Please
let my daughter find her homework and know that her prayers are heard and
answered.Â  Please donÂ’t let her lose her faith in prayer.Â”Â  Mother then began
looking all over the house for the missing homework papers.Â  She received a
strong impression.Â  Acting on this impression, she went outside to look in the
trash.Â  There in the trash, right on top, was MalorieÂ’s homework.Â  Inspiration
can guide us to serve as the LordÂ’s hands in answering prayers if we are in
frequent communication with Him through prayer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>When and Where We Pray</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The scriptures instruct us to Â“pray always.Â”<a href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[47]</span></span></a>
Pray regularly, consistently, day in and day out; and also, live with the
Spirit of prayer always in your hearts.Â  Again, Amulek speaks of praying Â“both
morning, mid-day, and evening.Â”Â  We should Â“pour out [our] soulsÂ” to the Lord
in Â“[our] closets, and [our] secret places, and in [the] wilderness.Â”<a href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[48]</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even though we have been commanded to pray regularly, at times
we neglect our personal prayers. Perhaps we say to ourselves, Â“I am too tired.Â 
IÂ’ll pray in the morning.Â  IÂ’m going to be late this morning.Â  IÂ’ll pray
tonight.Â  Why bother.Â  It wonÂ’t change anything.Â  IÂ’m doing all right so far.Â 
IÂ’ll wait until I really need something important.Â”Â  One stake president
counsels his youth to stop, drop, listen, and crawl each night.Â  That is to
stop whatever they might be doing at bedtime, drop to their knees for prayers,
listen for promptings, and then crawl into bed.Â  He counsels them in the
morning to crawl, drop, stop, and listen.Â  Crawl out of bed, drop to their
knees in prayer, and then stop and listen for their instructions from the Lord
for that day.Â  Brigham Young said that when you donÂ’t feel like praying, just
tell your knees to bend.<a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[49]</span></span></a>Â  Remember the
words of the hymn:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ere you left your room this morning, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Did you think to pray?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the name of Christ, our Savior, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Did you sue for loving favor, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a shield today?<a href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[50]</span></span></a> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Personal prayers are often more beneficial when spoken
aloud.Â  As we hear ourselves, we focus and prevent our minds from wandering.Â 
This requires a private place.Â  If this is not possible, a private prayer
offered in silence still requires our undivided attention to be powerful and
mighty. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jesus commanded: Â“Pray in your families unto the Father,
always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.Â”<a href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[51]</span></span></a>Â 
Occasionally it is well to stop and examine our habits of family prayer.Â  When
all seven of our children were living at home, we had the tradition of
gathering for family prayer by kneeling at a sofa.Â  This sofa was placed along
a wall that had a framed picture of a pioneer home hung upon it.Â  For a few
months we had foreign exchange student from Japan living with us.Â  She was not
Christian, yet she would join us for family prayer.Â  One day, just before she
was to return to Japan, she asked about the significance of our family
worshipping a pioneer home.Â  She thought the picture was a religious shrine.Â 
This was a case of misunderstanding.Â Â  We need to be sure our family prayers
invite understanding and increase faith.Â Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An experience shared by Elder David E. Sorensen also
illustrates this.Â  He said: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We lived on a busy street. . . .Â  My wife and I were
concerned about the danger that street presented to our children.Â  We used
every opportunity to reinforce the importance of staying away from the street.Â 
In addition, this was a time in our childrenÂ’s lives when they were learning
about temples and eternal families.Â  So our childrenÂ’s prayers regularly
included this request: Â“Please help us to be married in the temple and stay out
of the street.Â”Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One day after some of our neighborÂ’s children had gone home
after playing at our house, my wife received a call from their mother.Â  One of
her children had heard a prayer while he was visiting us and had offered this
variation when he said his own prayer at home: Â“Please help us stay out of the
temple and get married in the street.Â”Â  I trust that that particular prayer was
not received exactly the way it was phrased. <a href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[52]</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Spirituality is nurtured in the home as parents and children
unite with God in prayer.Â  I have a personal testimony of the power and
blessings of family prayer.Â  In the fall of my eighth year, I became ill with
polio.Â  I remember walking home after school one cold autumn day.Â  About
halfway home, I realized that my neck was very stiff and I could not control it
from falling to one side.Â  I crawled up the back porch steps to get inside.Â  My
mother asked what I was doing on my hands and knees.Â  I responded, Â“I canÂ’t
help it.Â”Â Â  I had a fever and I was very weak. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At first my parents were very concerned for my life and then
for my recovery.Â  Even though I was frail, I remember feeling hope and peace.Â 
My childlike trust in my parentsÂ’ ability to care for me, and my faith that
Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers, comforted me.Â  The world celebrated
the discovery of the polio vaccine, but my family also celebrated the power of
prayer.Â  Now when I am tired, I limp a little, almost as a reminder that
prayers were and are answered.Â  This is the reassuring testimony of prayer I
received as a child, carry in my heart, and share with you.Â  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Live As You Pray</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Young Joseph Smith entered a grove to pray with faith that a

none of the churches.Â  He did as he was told.Â  He obeyed.Â  Joseph SmithÂ’s
faith, prayer, and obedience allowed the keys of the kingdom of God to be
restored to the earth.Â  Because he was obedient, we have available to us the
all the blessings God offers to men.Â Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Prayer and actions are tied together.Â  Elder Bruce R.
McConkie taught Â“that our deeds, in large measure, are children of our
prayers.Â  Having prayed, we act; our proper petitions have the effect of
charting a righteous course of conduct for us.Â  The boy who prays earnestly and
devoutly and in faith that he may go on a mission, will then prepare himself
for his mission.Â  The young people who pray always, in faith, to marry in the
temple, and then act accordingly, are never satisfied with worldly marriage.Â”<a href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[53]</span></span></a>Â 
The acts and deeds of our lives are both the preparation and the conclusion of
our prayers. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Promised Blessings</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Can you imagine the feelings of joy the Prophet Joseph Smith
felt when he recorded this promise from a God he had both seen and heard?Â 
Â“Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your
blessingÂ–yea, even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth.Â”<a href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[54]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Ezra Taft Benson assures us that Â“men and women
who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out
of their lives than they can.Â  He will deepen their joys, expand their vision,
quicken their minds, . . . lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase
their opportunities, comfort their souls, . . . and pour out peace.Â”<a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[55]</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hopefully all of us can recount with frequency and fluency
the many times our prayers have been answered.Â  We can recognize the power and
strength we have knowing our Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers.Â  I
mentioned earlier as part of my preparation for today, I have kept a journal of
my feelings about prayer. I would like to share just a few of the blessings I
recently recorded:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="levnl11" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>$</span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I have an
increased feeling of Heavenly FatherÂ’s love for me.</p>
<p class="levnl11" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>$</span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I have received a
greater witness of the gospel through my prayers and the prayers of others.</p>
<p class="levnl11" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>$</span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I am learning
that prayer is a labor of love.Â  It takes great desire and effort on our
part.Â Â  It is not for wimps, but the blessings of peace and joy are abundant.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So what now?Â  Think for a moment about the questions stated
at the beginning of this hour.Â  Through desire and effort, we can turn those
questions into statements of testimony.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="levnl11" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>$</span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We can testify of
Joseph Smith, not only his experience with prayer, but our own knowledge that
Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers. </p>
<p class="levnl11" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>$</span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We can offer more
meaningful prayers as we listen and follow the promptings of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="levnl11" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>$</span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We can experience
the power and blessings of daily personal and family prayers. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Throughout the scriptures, our Savior taught and exemplified
the purpose and power of prayer.Â  He undertook the most important event of all
mankind through prayer in the sacred garden grove of Gethsemane.Â  And
especially on this day, June 27, we remember Joseph Smith, who also exemplified
the power and blessings of prayer in another grove as he faithfully approached
God in his desire to know the truth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I testify that as we approach the Lord in prayer, with the
righteous desires of our heart, the Spirit will guide our words and purify our
hearts.Â  We will Â“arise and shine forth, that [our] light may be a standard for
the nations,Â” and He will pour His blessings upon us.<a href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title=""><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[56]</span></span></a>Â 
Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ.Â  Amen.Â  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Brothers and sisters, I have been studying and thinking
and pondering about this scripture for many weeks.Â  My effort to understand

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Brothers and sisters, these scriptures teach us valuable
lessons about the meaning of the phrase </font>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&quot;</span><font face="Times New Roman">Arise
and shine forth.&quot;&nbsp;
Let me suggest that the admonition to ARISE is an invitation to ongoing and
ever-deeper personal conversion to the Lord Jesus Christ.Â  Notice how the
language in the left-hand column focuses upon <u>loving</u> and <u>obeying</u>
God, <u>obtaining</u> the word of God,Â  <u>hearkening</u> and <u>listening</u>
to the voice of God, and <u>experiencing</u> the mighty change of heart and <u>becoming
converted</u>. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The challenge to SHINE FORTH is an invitation to stand as
a light in a darkened world, to represent the Light of Life to those who have
lost their way (Alma 5:14; 3 Nephi 12:14). Â In doing so, we support and serve
others and assist in establishing and bringing forth the cause of Zion.Â  Note
how the language in the middle column focuses upon <u>loving</u> and <u>strengthening</u>
neighbors, <u>increasing our concern</u> for the well-being of others, and <u>opening
our mouths</u> to share with others the good news of the gospel.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The sequence of first arising and then shining forth-of personal
conversion and service to others-is
significant and unmistakable in each of the verses we just reviewed.Â  We must
experience the love of God in our own lives before we can fully love and serve
our neighbors.Â  When we have enjoyed that supernal and sanctifying influence
the scriptures call the </font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&quot;</span><font face="Times New Roman">pure
love of Christ&quot;
(Moroni 7:47), we are empowered to love and lift and liberate others.Â  We must
personally be converted before we can strengthen our brethren and sisters.Â  We
must obtain the word of God before our tongues can be loosed to appropriately
teach and bear testimony.Â  And each of us must first arise before we can shine
forth.Â  To ARISE is to come alive, to awaken to things of righteousness through
individual conversion and preparation-all
of which precedes making a distinctive difference in the lives of others.Â  We
SHINE FORTH after arising and as we reflect and emulate the Light of the world,
as we serve and teach and strengthen and warn those around us.Â  Interestingly,
we are to </font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&quot;</span><font face="Times New Roman">shine
forth&quot; with the word forth
suggesting a sense of purposive direction.Â  We are not merely to shine; we are
to &quot;shine
forth.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">This same pattern of personal conversion and service to
others frequently was emphasized in the teachings of President Harold B. Lee.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">I read again and again the
experience of Peter and John, as they went through the gate beautiful on the
way to the temple.Â  Here was one who had never walked, impotent from his birth,
begging alms of all who approached the gate.Â  And as Peter and John approached,
he held out his hand expectantly, asking for alms.Â  Peter, speaking for this
pair of missionaries-church
authorities-said,
&quot;Look on us.&quot;Â 
And, of course, that heightened his expectation.Â  Then Peter said, &quot;Silver
and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee:Â  In the name of Jesus
Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.&quot;Â  (Acts 3:4, 6)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Now in my mind's eye I can
picture this man and what was in his mind.Â  &quot;Doesn't this man know that I
have never walked?Â  He commands me to walk.&quot;Â  But the
biblical record doesn't end there.Â  Peter just didn't content himself by
commanding the man to walk, but he &quot;took him by the right hand, and lifted
him up . .. .&quot;Â  (Acts 3:7)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Will you see that picture now of
that noble soul, that chiefest of the apostles, perhaps with his arms around
the shoulders of this man, and saying,Â  &quot;Now, my good man, have courage.Â 
I will take a few steps with you. Â Let's walk together, and I assure you that
you can walk, because you have received a blessing by the power and authority
that God has given us as men, his servants.&quot;Â  Then the
man leaped with joy.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">You cannot lift another soul
until you are standing on higher ground than he is.Â  You must be sure, if you
would rescue the man, that you yourself are setting the example of what you
would have him be.Â  You cannot light a fire in another soul unless it is
burning in your own soul.Â  (Harold B. Lee, <u>Stand Ye In Holy
Places</u>, p. 186, emphasis added)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">What are the implications for you and for me of this
frequently emphasized pattern of personal conversion and service to others-of arising and then
shining forth?Â  Let me suggest just two.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
</font> <u><font face="Times New Roman">Implication #1 - Families as the
Arena for Arising</font></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The most appropriate place or arena wherein we can
</font> <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;</span><font face="Times New Roman">arise&quot; is in our
families.Â  The Proclamation on the Family explains that: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">The family is ordained of God.Â 
Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan.Â  Children are
entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father
and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity.Â  Happiness in
family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of
the Lord Jesus Christ.Â  Successful marriages and families are established and
maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect,
love, compassion, work and wholesome recreational activities.Â  By divine
design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness
and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their
families.Â  Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their
children.Â  In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated
to help one another as equal partners.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Brothers and sisters, please consider with me the
centrality of the family to the Father's
plan.Â  I think we would all agree that the family can and should be the most
natural and the most effective setting for learning and applying gospel
doctrine and principles, for becoming converted, and for, as we have been
discussing this morning, arising.Â  And as we just reviewed in the Proclamation,
the family is ordained of God, marriage is essential to the Father's plan, children are
entitled to birth and nurturing by parents who honor covenants and commitments,
and happiness in family life is predicated upon gospel doctrine and correct
principles.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">I would simply pose this one question:Â  Why?Â  Why is the
family central to the plan?Â  Why are the family and the home the principal
places for arising?Â  Let me suggest a few thoughts that have come to my mind as
I have reflected on these questions.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">A major reason the family is so important to the plan is
really quite straightforward:Â  it is the only place where we cannot hide from
who we really are as we strive to become what we are destined to become.Â  In
essence, a family is the mirror through which we become aware of imperfections
and flaws we may not be able or want to acknowledge.Â  No one knows us better
than the members of our family.Â  Thus, the family is the ultimate laboratory in
mortality for the improving and perfecting of God's children.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, let us &quot;.
. . liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning&quot; (1 Nephi 19:23).Â 
Please notice the importance of a gospel foundation and context for recognizing
and overcoming weakness, as described in verses 24-28 of section 1 in the
Doctrine and Covenants:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Behold, I am God and have spoken
it; these commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants in their
weakness, after the manner of their language, that they might come to
understanding.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">And inasmuch as they erred it
might be made known;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">And inasmuch as they sought
wisdom they might be instructed;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">And inasmuch as they sinned they
might be chastened, that they might repent;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">And inasmuch as they were humble
they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from
time to time.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">As we liken these verses unto ourselves and our families
in this latter day, we clearly recognize that the family is the supernal
setting wherein our errors might be made known, where we may be instructed,
where we may be chastened unto repentance, and where the humble may be blessed
from on high.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Several years ago when I was a business professor at the
University of Arkansas, I received a phone call from Elder Henry B. Eyring.Â 
During the conversation he asked me this question:Â  &quot;Elder Bednar, we are
in the process of identifying a new president for Ricks College.Â  Would you be
interested in being considered?&quot;Â 
I said, &quot;I
would be delighted to learn about the position and be considered.&quot;Â  He then said, </font>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&quot;</span><font face="Times New Roman">Good.Â  You and your
wife need to be in Salt Lake City tomorrow.&quot;Â  That evening at dinner I reviewed the
unexpected events of the day with our 15&#8209;year&#8209;old son and said, &quot;Jeffrey, I received
a call from Elder Eyring today.Â  Mom and I will be traveling to Salt Lake City
tomorrow to be interviewed about the possibility of becoming the president of
Ricks College.&quot;Â 
He looked at me between bites of food and without any hesitation said, &quot;Dad, there have to
be a lot of guys in the Church better qualified for that job than you!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Now what does this experience illustrate about the
central role of the family and our homes in the plan of salvation?Â  Truth is
knowledge of things as they really were, as they really are, and as they really
will be ( 93:24; Jacob 4:13).Â  Sometimes we learn the poignant truth about what
we really do and who we really are and what we really are like in the family,
and we cannot hide from the truths that we do not want to see and about which
we do not want to be reminded.Â  Sometimes such truth can be very disturbing and
distressing.Â  Sometimes we do not deal very well with such truth.Â  But in our
family we cannot avoid the reminders to repent and to improve and to serve.Â 
Further, through family interactions we learn to love and value people who are
not perfect-people
who make mistakes, people whose growth toward spiritual wholeness is still
under way.Â  And the tender relationships and feelings in the family inspire and
encourage us to be better than we would ordinarily be.Â  Consequently,
confronting truths about ourselves in a supportive family setting nurtures the
process of continuing individual repentance and progress and ongoing
conversion.Â  So why is a family and our home the most natural and most
effective arena for arising?Â  Because in our families we find the truth about
ourselves that we can find in no other place.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The Savior emphatically emphasized the home as a special
setting for the learning of gospel doctrine and principles.Â  Please turn to
3&nbsp;Nephi, chapter 17.Â  You will recall that in chapter 17 the Savior was
teaching the people in the Land of Bountiful near the temple.Â  Beginning in
verse 1:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Behold, now it came to pass that
when Jesus had spoken these words he looked round about again on the multitude,
and he said unto them:Â  Behold, my time is at hand.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">I perceive that ye are weak, that
ye cannot understand all my words which I am commanded of the Father to speak
unto you at this time.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, go ye unto your homes,
and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my
name, that ye may understand, and prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come
unto you again.Â  (3&nbsp;Nephi&nbsp;17:1-3, emphasis added)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">What an instructive formula:Â  (1) go to your home, (2)
ponder upon the things that have been said, (3) ask of the Father in Christ's name that you will
understand, and (4) prepare your mind for additional instruction.Â  Even though
the most influential and powerful and effectiveÂ  teacher who ever lived was in
their midst and instructing these people, yet He, Jesus Christ, recognized that
true understanding would come in the home.Â  I find it powerful and significant
that Christ emphasized the setting of the home as the place for understanding
the doctrines of the gospel.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">I hope we all have noticed the repeated use of and
emphasis upon the concept of understanding in the scriptures we have
reviewed thus far.Â  The word understanding is commonly described in the
scriptures in relation to the heart.Â  For example, </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Ye have not applied your hearts
to understanding; therefore, ye have not been wise.Â  (Mosiah 12:27,
emphasis added)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">And the multitude did hear and do
bear record; and their hearts were open and they did understand in their hearts
the words which he prayed. (3&nbsp;Nephi&nbsp;19:33, emphasis added)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">I find it most interesting in these verses that
understanding is linked, first and foremost, to the heart.Â  Note that we are
not explicitly counseled to apply our minds to understanding.Â  Obviously, we
must use our minds and our rational capacity to obtain and evaluate information
and to reach appropriate conclusions and judgments.Â  But perhaps the scriptures
are suggesting to us that reason and </font>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&quot;</span><font face="Times New Roman">the
arm of the flesh&quot;
( 1:19) are not sufficient to produce true understanding.Â  Thus, understanding,
as the word is used in the scriptures, does not refer solely or even primarily
to intellectual or cognitive comprehension.Â  Rather, understanding occurs when
what we know in our mind is confirmed as true in our hearts by the witness of
the Holy Ghost.Â  The spiritual gift of revelation most typically operates as
thoughts and feelings put into our hearts by the Holy Ghost ( 100:5-8; 8:2).Â 
And as testimony and conviction move from our heads to our hearts, we no longer
just have knowledge or information</font><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>-</span><font face="Times New Roman">but
we begin to understand and experience the mighty change of heart.Â  We are
arising.Â  Understanding, then, is a revealed outcome and a spiritual gift.Â 
And, as the Savior taught the Nephites, in the family and in our home we are
most receptive to teaching and revelation and witnessing by the Holy Ghost.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Now please turn to section 68 in the Doctrine and
Covenants.Â  In these verses, please pay particular attention to the word understand.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">And again, inasmuch as parents
have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach
them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of
the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on
of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">For this shall be a law unto the
inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized.Â  (68:25-26, emphasis added)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">These verses do not simply recommend or suggest that we
teach our children.Â  Rather, they outline a law unto the inhabitants of Zion-that we must teach
our children <u>to understand</u>.Â  Understanding is a spiritual outcome; it is
a result.Â  Simply engaging in the activity of teaching is not the
responsibility we have been assigned.Â  Rather, the charge is to teach children
to understand.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">I believe, brothers and sisters, that verses 25-26 in
section 68 are an admonition for parents to create a home that is a house of
learning wherein the Holy Ghost can reside and teach.Â  In such a home the Holy
Ghost brings conviction to the heart and teaches both children and parents to
understand.Â  Ultimately, it is not parents who do the teaching.Â  The parents
have important and vital roles to play; they must create an appropriate
spiritual environment and setting, they must invite the Spirit, and they must
facilitate and aid spiritual learning by children.Â  But the parents cannot, in
and of themselves, effect the kind of spiritual understanding described in the
scriptures and about which we have been talking.Â  The teacher is the Holy
Ghost.Â  It is teaching by and the witness of the Spirit that produces
understanding.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">These scriptures point to the family as a powerful place
for teaching by the Holy Ghost.Â  Within a Christ-centered family, love,
worthiness, obedience, trust, and confidence invite the Holy Ghost.Â  I believe
these scriptures underscore the importance of the family in the Father's eternal plan and of
striving to establish a family and home wherein the Holy Ghost can be the
definitive teacher.Â  And, as parents in Zion, we have the responsibility to
establish such a house of learning-a
place wherein we can arise and be converted and truly shine forth and serve
others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </font> <u>
<font face="Times New Roman">Implication #2 - The Work of
Proclaiming the Gospel As Shining Forth</font></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Let me now quickly emphasize a second implication of this
frequently emphasized scriptural pattern of personal conversion and service to
others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The natural result of arising-of an ever-deepening
conversion to the Lord Jesus Christ-is
a spiritually instinctive and intuitive desire to share with others that which
we know to be true and which has changed our hearts in such important ways.Â 
Brothers and sisters, I am not simply talking about missionary work.Â  I am
talking about the work of proclaiming the gospel that results from and grows
out of continuing conversion to the Savior.Â  Men and women pressing forward on
the pathway of personal and ongoing conversion do not need to be goaded,
prodded, or pushed to participate in the work of proclaiming the gospel.Â  One
may feel inadequate and may sense his or her limitations as a messenger of the
restored gospel; but the more converted we become the less fear and hesitation
we feel, the less attention we pay to ourselves, and the more reliant we become
upon the Lord and His Spirit.Â  Such men and women are eager and seek for
opportunities to open their mouths (33:7-10).Â  Stated another way, fear or
reluctance to open our mouths may be the most telling indicator of both our
direction and pace on the pathway of personal and continuing conversion.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The scriptural account of Andrew's first encounter
with, belief in, and following of the Savior illustrates in a powerful way the
importance of &quot;shining
forth.&quot;Â 
Andrew was the brother of Peter.Â  In John 1:35-42 we read:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Again the next day after John
stood, and two of his disciples;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">And looking upon Jesus as he
walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">And the two disciples heard him
speak, and they followed Jesus.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Then Jesus turned, and saw them
following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which
is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">He saith unto them, Come and
see.Â  They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day:Â  for it
was about the tenth hour.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the two which heard John
speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">He first findeth his own brother
Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being
interpreted, the Christ.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Times New Roman">And he brought him to Jesus. . .
.Â  (emphasis added)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Brothers and sisters, consider this powerful story about
Andrew finding and then bringing his brother to Christ as background for the
Master's
subsequent instruction to Peter almost three years later:Â  When thou art
converted, strengthen thy brethren (Luke 22:32). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Just as Andrew found and brought his brother Peter to
Jesus, so you and I have the responsibility to arise and to shine forth</font><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>-</span><font face="Times New Roman">to do all within our
power to come unto Christ, to be changed and renewed, and to bring to Jesus our
families and our brothers and sisters and our friends and colleagues.Â  Such
desire and action are the natural consequences of ongoing personal conversion</font><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>-</span><font face="Times New Roman">of truly arising and
then shining forth.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Brothers and sisters, we arise as we love God, as we seek
to obtain His word, as we keep His commandments and honor covenants, as we
hearken and listen to Him and to His anointed servants, and as we become more
fully converted to Christ and experience the mighty change of heart and have no
more disposition to do evil.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">We shine forth as we do good continually, as we feel an
increasing desire for the welfare of our brothers and sisters, as we strive to
strengthen our brethren and sisters, as we seek to bring forth and establish
the cause of Zion, and as our tongues are loosed and we raise the voice of
warning.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The family is the divinely appointed arena in which we
most appropriately and effectively begin to arise.Â  The work of proclaiming the
gospel is a prime example of shining forth.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">This day may each of us resolve to both arise and to
shine forth.Â  May our ongoing conversion be reflected in our conversations and
in our countenances and in our conduct-both
in our families and in our homes and with our friends and colleagues and
associates.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">I testify and witness that God lives and that Jesus is
the Christ.Â  I also testify that the fulness of the gospel has been restored to
the earth in these latter days.Â  The morning breaks, the shadows are fleeing,
and each of us has a responsibility to arise and shine forth.Â  In the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What a pleasure it is for us to be here with you today.Â  We<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>ve all had a chance to
ponder and reflect upon our theme for this Education Week, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Arise and shine forth, that
thy light may be a standard for the nations<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
(Doctrine and Covenants 115:5).Â  We<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>ve
received great instruction and insight about this theme in our devotionals the
past two days.Â  I now wish to invite the spirit of the Holy Ghost to be here
with us as I seek to express some of my thoughts and feelings on this
penetrating scripture.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I first learned about our theme for Education Week, my
thoughts turned to an experience I had several years ago at a radiology clinic
in Arkansas.Â  I had gone there as a part of my yearly exam and had been asked
to wait in the examination room, draped in one of those dreadful hospital
gowns, while the technician made sure the x-rays she had taken were clear and
readable.Â  I sat there for quite some time until the technician returned to the
room and remarked, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>The
radiologist will be here in a moment to speak with you.<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  I thought that was a bit unusual so, of
course, I was assuming the worst.Â  I could feel my heart begin to pound as my
mind started to anxiously race.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The radiologist calmly entered the room, introduced himself,
sat down on a stool next to where I was seated, and said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I just wanted to meet a
Mormon mother!<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> You
can imagine my shock and my relief.Â  This doctor then explained that his wife
was a teacher at the high school where our sons and a small number of LDS youth
from our ward attended.Â  His wife had taught our sons as well as several other
LDS students, and he wanted me to know how impressed she was with the caliber
of these students and how impressed he was with the comments she had made at
home about these youth.Â  <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>The
members of your church just know how to do things right,<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> he said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Arise and shine forth, that thy light
may be a standard for the nations (Doctrine and Covenants 115:5).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How grateful I felt that day for the example of righteous
youth.Â  There were only a handful of LDS students in the high school, yet they
had made a positive and distinct impression on this teacher and her husband.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I consider the words <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Arise
and shine forth,<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> I am
reminded of a related scripture from the Doctrine and Covenants.Â  In section
82:14 we read:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">For Zion must increase in beauty, and
in holiness; her borders must be enlarged, her stakes must be strengthened; yea,
verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">President Ezra Taft Benson taught:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The phrase <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>put on her beautiful garments<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> refers, of course, to the
inner sanctity that must be attained by every member who calls himself or
herself a Saint.Â  [Ezra Taft Benson, <u>Come Unto Christ</u> (Salt Lake City:
Deseret Book, 1983), Chapter 13, p. 102]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We profess our willingness to become Saints or disciples of
the Savior as we repent, enter the waters of baptism, receive the gift of the
Holy Ghost, make and keep sacred temple covenants, and live according to the
doctrines and principles taught in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As we seek to <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>arise
and put on [our] beautiful garments<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
and become <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>spiritually
born of God,<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> we grow
and develop in our discipleship and righteous commitment.Â  We acquire an inner
beauty, a holiness, and a strength that reflects a light from within.Â  We<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>ve all seen that light in
the countenance of a mother as she caresses her newborn baby.Â  It<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s visible in the faces ofÂ 
worthy sons as we embrace in the celestial room of the temple after they
receive their endowments in preparation for full-time missionary service.Â  This
light glows from the faces of dedicated and consecrated temple workers who
assist us as we renew our sacred covenants.Â  Righteous men, women, and children
radiate this light.Â  As noble Saints, they have received His image in their
countenances.Â  We can see it; others can see it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fact that others can discern this light was brought to
my attention one night at a junior high basketball game.Â  Our son was the only
LDS player on the team.Â  Our coach<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
wife happened to be sitting next to me in the bleachers, and she introduced me
to the friend sitting next to her, who happened to be the wife of the coach of
the opposing team.Â  Our coach<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
wife turned to me and said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>We<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>ve been talking about your
son.Â  There<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
something different about him.Â  You can see it in his face.Â  He<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s not like the other boys.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I knew what it was.Â  It was that light we have been talking
about<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>C</span>a light
reflected by living in such a way that the Spirit is always with us as promised
every Sunday in our sacramental prayers.Â  This light makes us distinctive and
different.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> (Doctrine and Covenants

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Benson has said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">In this revelation is a command to let
our light so shine that it becomes a standard for the nations.Â  A standard is a
rule of measure by which one determines exactness or perfection.Â  The Saints
are to be a standard of holiness for the world to see.Â  [Ezra Taft Benson, <u>Come
Unto Christ</u> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1983), Chapter 13, p. 103] </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Embedded in the word standard is the word stand.Â  As a noun
this word means to have an attitude or opinion about something or to take
position on an issue.Â  As a verb the word stand means to get up or rise.Â  To
stand for something means to advocate, endorse, or support.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have all covenanted in the waters of baptism that we are
willing to <b>stand</b> as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and
in all places (see Mosiah 18:9), yet so many of us are content to just sit for
truth and righteous because standing may ruffle a few feathers, draw unwanted
attention, or bring ill will to us.Â  We are afraid to become involved; we lack
courage to stand for truth and righteousness.Â  But sitting will not accomplish
the task of building the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
kingdom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brother Robert Millet has said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Discipleship involves standing out from
the generality of mankind and standing up for what is true and right and good.Â 
We come to make a difference only when we are different, and that difference
must be substantive enough to be witnessed and then acknowledged by others.Â 
[Robert L. Millet, <u>An Eye Single to the Glory of God</u>, (Salt Lake City:
Deseret Book, 1991), Chapter 9, p. 47]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am aware of a group of LDS citizens who banned together to
address their concerns to store managers about the suggestive and lewd window
front displays in their local mall.Â  A walk down any corridor of any mall in America
reveals just how much sensuality we are willing to tolerate.Â  I remember a time
when mothers used to protest a similar tactic when offensive images glared from
the covers of magazines that were placed within eye level of youngsters at the
checkout lines of supermarkets.Â  Yet today we take our young children and
teenagers to shop in malls where they see scantily clad mannequins as well as
bigger than life-sized photos of immodestly dressed young women posed in
provocative positions with male counterparts in many store front windows.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This concerned group asked that store managers move their
offensive window dressings and displays to the inside of their stores.Â  This
request caused a bit of opposition and controversy in the <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Letters to the Editor<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> section of the newspaper,
but I applaud this group for their efforts.Â  They were willing to take a stand
for truth and righteousness.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In his April conference address in 1940, Elder John A.
Widtsoe offered this timeless counsel:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">So, we need, in this Church and
Kingdom, for our own and the world<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
welfare a group of men and women in their individual lives who shall be as a
light to the nations, and really standards for the world to follow.Â  Such a
people must be different from the world as it now is. . . . We cannot walk as
other men, or talk as other men, or do as other men for we have a different
destiny, obligation, and responsibility placed upon us, and we must fit
ourselves for that great destiny and obligation.Â  (<u>One Hundred Tenth Annual
Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</u>, April 5, 6,
7, 1940, p. 36)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Arise and shine forth, that thy light
may be a standard for the nations (Doctrine and Covenants 115:5).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The arising and shining begins in our own homes with our own
families.Â  Our light must then be a standard that will illuminate our
neighborhoods, our communities, and the nations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May we have the will to fulfill our destiny and undertake
this solemn charge.Â  May we have the courage to be that light that will be the
standard the Lord is counting on in this ever darkened and misguided world, is
my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My dear brothers and sisters, I<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>m humbled at the chance to occupy this
pulpit.Â  I have made a serious effort to prepare myself for today but I will
need your prayers for me . . and for yourselves so that we may be edified
together.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is my desire to help you understand your real purpose for
being here and to give you some practical tools to help you accomplish that
purpose.Â  I recommend that you make some notes, as I speak, that will help you
make use of these things later on.Â  It is my sincere prayer that when I have
finished, you will leave here thinking to yourselves, <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>m
going to try harder to meet the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
expectations of me, and I have made some notes on how I can do it.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  If that happens, I will
consider this talk a success.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Today I will speak to all of you, but especially to those of
you who have just arrived and are eager to start this new chapter in your
lives.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Boyd K. Packer has said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Latter-day Saints should worry less
about what they do, and more about what they are.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are many good things you will do while you are here,
but more importantly, there are some things that you should try to become while
you are here.Â  You came here <i>to do</i>, and the Lord will help you <i>to
become</i>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brother Stephen E. Robinson, an instructor at BYU, tells us
that somewhere in our Latter-day Saint culture, we have gotten the idea that we
belong to a gospel of lists, that somehow our final judgement interview will
consist of handing in our list of gospel chores with everything checked off:Â 
tithing - paid in full, church meetings - all attended, home teaching - 100%.Â 
Important as those things are, they will not be part of our final interview.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As we have been so well taught on this campus, our final
test will be an open book test.Â  Our final exam will be--<i>what we have become</i>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I hope you are aware of what an ideal growth atmosphere you
are now in.Â  You have essentially all of your physical needs provided for you
as well as many of your wants. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I also hope that you are aware of what a coveted position
you hold by being here and that you are under a sacred trust to make the most
of your time.Â  This expectation comes not only from your parents, but also from
the Executive Committee of the Church Educational System, of which President
Hinckley is the chairman, and also from the tithe payers throughout the Church.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Given our knowledge of why we are here and where we are
going, how fortunate you are to have chosen this place . . and to have had this
place choose you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord has said: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">For of him unto whom much is given,
much is required.Â  (Doctrine and Covenants 82:3)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That is nowhere more applicable than to students at this
university.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Undoubtedly, with your registration materials, you received
a page that contained the mission statement of Brigham Young University-Idaho.
In case you missed it, let me read the first of those four goals to you:Â  The
first declaration in the mission statement of Brigham Young University-Idaho
is:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">Build testimonies of the restored
gospel of Jesus Christ and encourage living its principles.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to focus on this statement with you today.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are many respected institutions of higher learning in
this land, but none has as its primary goal to build testimonies of Jesus
Christ, except those of the educational system of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.Â  The building of a testimony of Jesus Christ leads to
becoming like Jesus Christ.Â  It follows, therefore, that the primary mission of
Brigham Young University-Idaho is to help students become like Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I started Ricks College as a 17 year-old freshman in
September of 1965, I was here as a graduate of a very large high school just
down the valley.Â  Rexburg was a familiar place to me and I was comfortable
coming here because my umbilical cord was stretched for only about 30 miles.Â 
(For those without a medical background, that means my mother was only 30 miles
away.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was outwardly quite confident that I would soon be
clamping that cord as I showed my parents and myself that I could stand on my
own and succeed here.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Inwardly, however, I was scared.Â  What if I can<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t do the homework?Â  What
about all that reading I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>ve
heard about?Â  What if I sit home on Saturday night and watch Lawrence Welk
re-runs because no one will go out with me?Â  And the big one that scared me
most:Â Â  What if I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>m
just not college material?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My fears were heightened as I came to the registration
process. I must explain something about the registration process in 1965.Â  The
word <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>computer<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> in those days, meant
someone who calculates something (we also called them <span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>&gt;</span>nerds<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>)
and <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>on-line<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> was where you hoped the
clothes were after a windstorm.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The registration process back then consisted of a long line
of tables where the students came at their appointed times and picked up cards
for classes they wanted to take.Â  They would finish by turning the cards in at
another table to see if everything fit.Â  If it didn<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t, they started over again.Â  Mine didn<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t work the first few times,
and it took the help of a wonderful advisor to get me through the process.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I soon found that this campus was really a very friendly
place and that the homework <i>was</i> do-able . . if I applied myself.Â  The
staff and faculty were all oriented toward helping students and I found that
they were just extensions of a loving Heavenly Father who was always there for
me.Â  I testify to you that none of that has changed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I had many glorious experiences here and was involved in
many extra-curricular activities.Â  My sophomore year I was invited to be a
co-chairman of a springtime event they called R-Week.Â  It was similar in some
ways to Homecoming in that there was a parade, and a concert, and a dance, and
whitewashing the <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>R<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> on the North Menan Butte.Â 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The biggest event of the week was the Friday afternoon
competitions on the football field where clubs and individuals would compete.Â 
The crowning event was to be a tug-of-war, with the losing side being dragged
through a fire hose.Â  (Our fun was simple in those days!) School was to be
dismissed for the afternoon and the whole student body would turn out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We started the week with glorious April weather, but as
Friday approached cloudy days appeared and rain was forecast.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Those of us on the R-Week Committee had been working for
several months to be ready for this event and our spirits plummeted as we saw
the predicted weather move in.Â  On Thursday evening, as the wind and rain
threatened to spoil Friday<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
field events, our concerned committee counseled together and decided we had to
have the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s help
if the day were to be saved.Â  We decided to begin a fast and to meet the next
day before noon for prayer.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next morning dawned, raining and cold.Â  As I went about
my morning classes, I felt as gloomy as the weather.Â  I wondered how Heavenly
Father could let this happen when we had worked so hard, and especially since
we were now fasting for His help.Â  When our committee met, I could see the same
doubts in each of them.Â  We knelt together and poured out our hearts to the
Lord.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We ended the prayer and looked out the window to ongoing
rain.Â  We decided that we had better act on our faith so we went to the field
to continue our preparations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the events were to start at 1 p.m., we were standing on
the field at about 12:00, and we watched as the rain stopped, the clouds over
this part of Rexburg parted, and the sun shone through, drying the football
field.Â  The surrounding skies were still cloud-filled with rain here and there
in the distance, but we started our competitions that day on a dry, sun-filled
field.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the events came to a close several hours later, our
committee watched in awe as the clouds closed in and the wind and rain started
again.Â  We looked at the sky and then at each other and felt immense gratitude
that our faith had been confirmed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>m
certain that the miracle went unnoticed by many of the student body that day,
but those of us who had worked behind the scenes knew that God had answered our
prayers.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is still, somewhere in the historical files of this
institution, a two page summary written by a humbled young R-Week Co-chairman,
testifying to future student leaders (and anyone else who would read it) that
God indeed intervenes in the affairs of men.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If our goal is to become like Jesus Christ, then having the
Holy Ghost with us becomes essential to the process.Â  Before the early Saints
left for the West, the prophet Brigham Young saw the prophet Joseph in a
vision.Â  As the vision was closing, Brigham asked Joseph:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Â . . and if you have a word of counsel
for me, I should be glad to receive it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Whereupon Joseph said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Tell the people to be humble and
faithful and to be sure to keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them
right.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How would I go about getting and keeping the Spirit? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would take the opportunity each day to connect with the
Spirit, and I would do it by having my own personal devotional each morning.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You have noticed how top athletes go through a certain
routine as they get set to kick a field goal or to throw a pitch.Â  It is a
sequence of physical moves accompanied by mental concentration that helps them
focus their minds and get in top form.Â  Someone has referred to those rituals
as <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>getting in state.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In order to be on top of the game of life, we all need to <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>get in state<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> as we begin each day.Â 
Many individuals and many families have some form of a morning devotional, andÂ 
perhaps some of you do, too.Â  If not, I would suggest that you begin now.Â  It
will take some discipline and some practice, but the benefits can be endless .
. and eternal.Â  It has been said: <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>First
we make our habits, then our habits make us.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would begin my morning devotional with a prayer and
personal scripture study time.Â  That will prepare you to be receptive to the
Spirit.Â  Then I would write on a note card or a tablet some goals for the day
in several areas.Â  This pre-supposes that you have made some long-range goals,
perhaps in the form of a personal mission statement, that will guide your daily
choices.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let me suggest five areas for your daily goals and let them
be represented by the fingers of your left hand.Â  This visual aid will always
be <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>handy<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span> when you are ready to
start.</p>
<p class="Level1">1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><u>The thumb</u> represents faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
come back to some basic definitions for a moment.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Faith</i> means to hope for things
which are not seen, but which are true.Â  (Hebrews 11:1, Alma 32:21)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ</i>,
the first principle of the Gospel, means to hope for the activation of the
enabling power of the Atonement in one<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
life.Â  What do I mean by the enabling power of the Atonement? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Bruce R. McConkie, under the heading of grace in the
Bible Dictionary, explains the enabling power of the Atonement.Â  We read on
page 697:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The main idea of the word [grace] is
divine means of help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of
Jesus Christ . . .</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">It is likewise through the grace of the
Lord that individuals, through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and
repentance of their sins, receive strength and assistance to do good works that
they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means.Â  This
grace is the enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal
life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thus, the enabling power of the Atonement is the strength
and assistance each of us can receive, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ,
to lift us beyond our own natural abilities as we face the challenges of each
day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Therefore, in my morning devotional I would ask myself this
question:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">What will I face today that the
Savior can help me with?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You might be facing academic challenges like taking a test
or writing a paper or interpersonal challenges such as reducing tension in your
apartment by learning to appreciate a roommate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Holy Ghost is a marvelous companion to have while
preparing for a test, as we <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>seek
learning, even by <i>study</i> and also by <i>faith</i>.<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â  He is also a marvelous companion to have
while we resolve a delicate problem with a roommate.Â Â  (Doctrine and Covenants
88:118)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In either instance, having faith requires you to believe
that He can and will help you and it requires you to do what you must to keep
the Spirit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In your devotion you might also pray to have faith to
overcome such things as impatience, pride, the use of bad language, the viewing
of unworthy entertainment, or any other problem that is troubling you.Â  Please
remember also, that some of these <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>[go]
not out but by prayer <i>and fasting</i>.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
(Matthew 17:21)</p>

</span><u>The index finger</u> represents repentance. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many of us have the idea that repentance only comes into
play with a major transgression.Â  It is for that, but we must understand that
repentance is also required for the refining process that all true followers of
Christ must go through.Â  It is the baptism by fire, spoken of by the prophets,
that purifies us and washes our garments clean in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Repentance is not just the stopping of sin.Â  It requires a
turning of the heart to God, and as King Benjamin<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
people testified, it brings:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">. . a mighty change of heart . . that
we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.Â  (Mosiah
5:2)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The way to know that we have truly repented is that we have
no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Henry B. Eyring explains that we should ask the Lord
every day in prayer: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">What have I done today, or not done,
which displeases Thee?Â  If I can only know, I will repent with all my heart
without delay.Â  (Ensign, Nov. 99, p. 34)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With that in mind, I might ask myself the question:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">What have I done to offend the Lord
that I can repent of today?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And then I would listen inwardly.Â  You will know where to
start.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course we realize that repentance is a process and not an
event, but with consistent daily effort, forgiveness and healing will come, and
with it the marvelous peace of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a student at this university, please take seriously the
Honor and Dress Codes.Â  If, from time to time, an adjustment in your dress or
in your entertainment or your language is needed, I would make that adjustment
promptly, as a way to show that you are more concerned about pleasing the Lord
than about pleasing your peers or yourself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Someone has said,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And if men come unto me I will show
unto them their weakness.Â  I give unto men weakness that they may be humble;
and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if
they humble themselves before me and have faith in me, then will I make weak
things become strong unto them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sister, I testify that humility, combined with
faith in the atonement, is a most powerful tool for repentance.</p>

</span><u>The long finger</u> represents learning.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For now, you are here to complete a course of study.Â  Later,
you will want to set goals to keep your learning alive.Â  Education has always
been a primary emphasis of our Church for we know that it is <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>impossible for a man to be
saved in ignorance.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>(Doctrine
and Covenants 131:6) </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You must first understand that the mission of the Holy Ghost
is closely connected to the gaining and the use of knowledge.Â  The Savior
taught the apostle John:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The Holy Ghost . . shall teach you all
things, and bring all things to your remembrance.Â  (John 14:26)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">When he, the Spirit of truth, is come,
he will guide you into all truth.Â  (John 16:13)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is true, <i>knowledge is power</i>, but not all knowledge
is of the same value.Â  Remember the first goal in the mission statement of Brigham
Young University-Idaho is, to:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Build testimonies of the restored
gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, I am not suggesting that you neglect your secular
studies in favor of full-time gospel study, but I am promising you that if you
will make the time to study the scriptures and the modern prophets, both in and
out of your religion classes, this knowledge will compliment and vitalize your
classroom learning and you will have a framework wherein to fit all secular knowledge
. . and you will be able to discern truth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Truth is knowledge that abides on both sides of the veil.Â 
Some of the things that you will learn in this life will need to be unlearned
beyond the veil.Â  Truth will not.Â  Therefore you must learn to recognize truth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Harold B. Lee taught:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Recent years have ushered in
educational theories and philosophies that have questioned all the old
standards of religion, morality and family relationships.Â  Modern iconoclasts
have been at work . . to destroy faith in the old and trusted authoritative
teachings of the scriptures and to replace them with the uninspired, man-made
ethical doctrines that change with time and place.Â  (TPC, Harold B. Lee, p. 64)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An iconoclast is someone who attacks traditional beliefs and
values, especially religious beliefs.Â  These are the wolves in sheep<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s clothing, spoken of in
the scriptures and their teachings have crept into all educational fields, even
into some of the textbooks you will be studying.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your only defense will be to become students of the
scriptures and companions with the Holy Ghost. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For instance, you have no doubt been taught, and may be
taught again, that the earth is overpopulated and that we<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>re running out of resources
to sustain ourselves.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the other hand, the Lord has declared, regarding our
resources:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">For the earth is full, and there is
enough and to spare.Â  (Doctrine and Covenants 104:17)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How do you handle that dichotomy in your mind?Â  First of
all, you trust your testimony and your convictions.Â  Truth will prevail, it
always has and it always will.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the revelation on the Word of Wisdom was first given,
there was no scientific evidence to convince the critics that tobacco and
alcohol are bad for the body.Â  But look at the validation of that fact that is
available today.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It will be the same with the overpopulation myth, and every
other popular notion that appears to be in conflict with your faith.Â  Your job
is to trust in the Lord.Â  Your job is to keep your testimony firm!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, with that in mind, I might ask myself each morning:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">What truth can I learn today that will
bless me now as well as in the eternities? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I promise you that the Lord delights to teach you His
truth.Â  If you will ponder and pray for answers to these questions, He will
enlighten you on every matter that comes before you. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Quick1">4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><u>The ring finger</u> represents, guess what?Â  <i>Love</i>!Â  Now I
would not ask:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Whom
can I fall in love with today?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â Â 
Instead, I would ask:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Who
needs my love today?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you ponder that question, the name of a room mate or a
ward member or some other acquaintance will come to you.Â  It may be a parent, a
grandparent or a sibling.Â  Then ask the Lord to help </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">you formulate a way of expressing that love--today.Â  It may
be a note or a phone call, or maybe just a prayer in their behalf.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course, if you are wearing a gold band or a diamond on
that finger, then you have someone that needs reminding of your love everyday!Â 
Start there, but also go beyond.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Christ taught that we must <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>love
[our] neighbor as ourselves.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
And who is our neighbor?Â  The parable of the good Samaritan teaches us that
everyone who crosses our path is our neighbor. Surely there is someone in the
array of souls that will cross your path today that needs your love.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May I suggest that we also learn to apply the Savior<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s higher law of love,
wherein He says:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Love your enemies, bless them that
curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully
use you and persecute you.Â  (Matthew 5:44)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hopefully, you have no one in that category right now, but
if you don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t have, you
someday will.Â  The most Christlike kind of love is that which says, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Father, forgive them, for they know not
what they do.Â  (Mark 23:34)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And finally, Moroni tells us how to have that higher love
which he calls charity, the pure love of Christ:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">Wherefore, my beloved brethren,
pray unto the father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with
this love.Â  (Moroni 7:48)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How do I learn to love a cantankerous roommate?Â  Follow Moroni<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s counsel!Â Â  And I will
make you a promise.Â  If you will pray with all the energy of heart for that
roommate, he or she will become less cantankerous.Â Â  So often a difficult
personality comes because of a need to feel loved.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Savior<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
injunction, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>I was in
prison and ye came unto me,<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
(Matthew 25:36) the word <i>prison</i> has many meanings.Â  Many are trapped in
prisons of their own making, and they need our love, too.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">5)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  <u>The
little finger</u> represents planning.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Someone has said that planning is the activity of the
Gods.Â Â  If we study the scriptures with a focus on the importance of planning,
we will see such passages as this in Abraham:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">The Gods organized and formed the earth.
. . and the Gods saw that they would be obeyed and that their <i>plan</i> was
good.Â  (Abraham 4:1, 21)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And from Alma:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">The <i>plan</i> of mercy . .will
appease the demands of justiceÂ  . . and will bring about the great <i>plan</i>
of happiness.Â  (Alma 42:15,8)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">How great the <i>plan</i> of our God!Â 
(Alma 42:8)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would have some sort of a planner, and I would use it.Â 
Don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t just plan your
dates and your intramural games.Â  Plan your study time; plan your preparation
time; and then stick to your plan.Â  I have learned that when I also plan my fun
time, it makes the plan less of club and more of a tool for a complete life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is my belief that the parable of the talents refers to
time as well as to material things.Â  A good businessman will tell you, time is
money. A good student will tell you, time is good grades.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just as it is with money, if you carefully plan your time,
you will have more of it.Â  Let me repeat:<i>Â  If you carefully plan your time
you will have more of it.</i>Â  Let us not say, I don<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t have time for that.Â  It would be more honest
to say, I have chosen, either consciously or unconsciously, to not make time
for that.Â Â  We all have 24 hours in a day, but some do so much more with that
24 hours than others do.Â  Planning is the secret.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You have all seen the demonstration where the large rocks
are placed in the jar first and then the sand fills in around them.Â  The large
rocks represent the activities that are key to your reaching your goals,
whereas the sand represent all of the unplanned and less vital activities that
seem to fill up our days.Â  If we don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
put the rocks in first, and let the sand fill around them, soon the sand has
filled our day and the rocks don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
fit.Â  We must remember that those rocks are a sure foundation to our celestial
character house . . and every primary child knows what happens when you build
your house upon the sand.Â  (Matthew 7:26)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Joseph Smith said, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Worry
the Lord until He blesses you.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>Â 
I suggest that making and then praying over our plans is a way to bring down
the blessings of heaven.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now brothers and sister, I implore you to consider the
things which I have taught today.Â  As soon as you can, review the notes you
have taken and then make additional notes as ideas come that will help you to
implement these things. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By way of review, I would begin each day with a prayer and
scripture study.Â  Then I would look at the fingers of my hand, and remind
myself to:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">1) Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Have

</span>Plan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Start each day centered on that which matters most.Â  You may
find your own system, but do something<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>and
do it consistently!Â  Centering on the Lord, on a daily basis, will be of the
greatest assistance to your becoming a Christlike person.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As we continue to strive for perfection, Moroni tells us
what we must eventually become.Â Â  Finishing the verse from Moroni 7, we read:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">. . That ye may <i>become</i> the sons
of God, that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as
he is . . . that we may be purified even as he is pure.Â  (Moroni 7:48)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I testify that God lives and that Jesus Christ, in atoning
for our sins, has provided the means for us overcome our weakness, by faith,
and to return to our Father in Heaven as purified beings . . . even as types of
Christ.Â  This I do in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President and Sister Bednar, faculty, brothers and sisters,
my family and I are honored to be with you.Â  We have enjoyed your kind
hospitality.Â  This is truly a special privilege to be on this beautiful campus
today.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I think we all live in a remarkable time.Â  I know I am most
grateful for my life.Â  I have had special parents and a remarkable companion
for almost 50 years.Â  One by one our choice posterity is developing and we have
seen dramatic events occur in our world.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mortal life is a remarkable time for us.Â  It is truly a time
of learning and experiencing.Â  Some of the lessons are hard to learn.Â  It
shouldn<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t take any of
us very long to realize there are good and bad forces on this earth.Â  In fact,
they battle in different ways for your soul and for mine.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There will be many wonderful things happen during the time
you will spend on this earth.Â  They will probably be mingled with some
difficult times you can<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
even now imagine.Â  Then, no matter what comes, you will recognize this to be a
valuable part of your eternal quest.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is your time of preparing for that which you have been
foreordained to do while in mortality.Â  I hope you are building a solid
foundation for your work.Â  In one short verse of Luke we read of the Saviors
time of preparation:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">And Jesus increased in wisdom and
stature, and in favour with God and man.<sup> (1)</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have come to appreciate what He accomplished in maturing
so completely in such a short time in each of the four different ways
mentioned.Â  It is wonderful to have such an example to reach toward.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps the most challenging and rewarding part of maturing is
increasing in favor with God.Â  How wonderful it would be to have the maturity
shown by the Savior as he stood before pilot and as he knelt in the garden of
Gethsemane.Â  He would do what his Father in Heaven had asked, no matter what
the consequences.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>AYY</span>O my Father, if it be
possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou
wilt.<sup>(2)</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After prayerful consideration, it is one part of this
maturing process I wish to speak of today.Â  I pray my observations may be
helpful for those who truly want to live as the Savior has shown us.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have had the privilege of traveling to many parts of our
world and being exposed to many different cultures.Â  From that I have concluded
there is a major challenge to spiritual maturing that is often overlooked or
badly underestimated.Â  It is the source of subtle temptations that take most
people far away from the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
ways and they don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
even recognize what is happening.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is the powerful role of traditions and culture in our
lives.Â  I speak of the ways that develop in every home and every community and
which create the culture in which we live every day.Â  It<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s the way of life that becomes comfortable to
each of us and which seems normal to ourselves as well as to those around us no
matter where we may live.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In every part of this world, traditions have developed which
deeply affect how people talk, what they do, even the way they think.Â  We grow
up with them and see them as the way everyone lives so it should be good for
us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I remember when I was courting my wife before we were
married; I met her grandmother many times.Â  Years earlier, she left Sweden
along with her husband and their eight year old daughter, who later became my
mother-in-law.Â  They left because of the persecution they were receiving.Â  It
came from being devoted members of this church in a nation where it was
customary for everyone to belong to another church.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even though she had been in America for many years, I could
hardly understand what she said because of her strong Swedish accent.Â  Like all
immigrants to any country, she had struggled against changing cultures.Â  She
wanted to keep those ways that seemed familiar including her language.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We all have the choice of what culture we will adopt in our
daily living.Â  The one that is comfortable to follow and which brings
popularity and acceptance may not really be the best one for us.Â  My wife<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s grandmother was ridiculed
both in Sweden and in this country for being different from the accepted norms
around her.Â  Knowing her feelings about the gospel and seeing the vast amount
of family history work she did, I don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
think there was any ridicule awaiting her when she passed to the other side.Â  I
assume she found a culture in which she finally felt at home.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes we think it would be easy to move from the
environment in which we live on this earth to living with our Father in
Heaven.Â  As we consider that no unclean thing can be in his presence, we
realize what a dramatic difference it will be from life on this earth.Â  Some
may think it is okay to live as the world around us lives because we are good
people and we do want to be accepted by others and have all the things they
have.Â  We think that someday we will live on a higher level of spirituality.Â 
But then we read:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y</span>I
beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until
the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity,
behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night
of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.<sup> (3)</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is interesting how the attitudes and habits formed while
we are young become our established ways as we grow older.Â  And they are not
easily changed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some traditions can be a great blessing to us and our
families.Â  Hopefully, each of you can reflect on the good traditions that have
been an important part of your life.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps it was family prayer, or scripture reading times, or
special ways of honoring a family member.Â  It may have been the way children
were put to bed or special trips as a family<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>the
list of possibilities goes on and on.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is important for families to develop such traditions for
they will bless their children in many ways.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Good traditions are mentioned often in the holy scriptures.Â 
Old Testament life was founded on many traditions purposely given by the Lord.Â 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the musical <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>, Tevya sings of
traditions and the powerful influence they are in our lives.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As we reflect on the pleasures associated with good
traditions, we might also note a serious warning given to us by the Lord.Â  This
reminds us that Satan also uses traditions for his purposes.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The glory of God is intelligence, or,
in other words, light and truth.Â  Light and truth forsake the evil one.Â  Every
spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from
the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God.Â  And
that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth through disobedience,
from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.<sup> (4)</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We can easily see how we lose light and truth through
disobedience of God<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
laws it is usually much harder to see how traditions deter our spiritual
maturing when they are a significant part of our way of life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For those of us who are older, it is easy to see the changes
that have occurred in recent years in the culture of America.Â  There have been
some wonderful changes, but Satan has certainly influenced many aspects of our
daily life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I remember my mother saying she was so happy she raised her
children when she did because the culture that existed then was much more
wholesome than what we faced when raising our children.Â  Now we say to our
children how much we admire their efforts to raise good offspring when there
are so many more evil temptations and wrong concepts to cope with in the world
than we had to face.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have found it is very easy to go into another culture and
see traditions that are not spiritually uplifting.Â  In fact there are always
some that obviously contradict important gospel principles.Â  They quietly teach
wrong concepts so people accept them without question because that is the way
they live.Â  But an outsider can come in and say, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Why
do they live this way?<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In some nations, a person<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
worth is determined by whether or not they are born into royalty, a certain
religion, or with a particular color of skin.Â  It is decided at birth what
their life is worth and what opportunities will be theirs.Â  In that culture,
the Lord never makes such distinctions.Â  His words are: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of <u>all</u> men,
that all men might repent and come unto him.<sup> (5)</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have seen governments of the world which take away one<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s desire for self-reliance.Â 
The citizens pay high taxes, and then the government does everything for them.Â 
Most become very complacent with their life.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A basic concept of eternal growth is that we do for
ourselves all we can rather that have others do more for us than is needed.Â  At
one time the Lord said:</p>

are agents unto themselves<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y</span>.<sup>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have seen the cultures where leadership means absolute
control and complete subjugating of its citizens.Â  That is not the kind of
leadership the Lord spoke of when he said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;

<p class="MsoNormal">Abuse of all types is satanic whether it be physical,
emotional, or sexual.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is no place in the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
culture for any who would exercise unrighteous dominion over others, but that
is a very common practice to some extent in nearly every culture on the earth.Â 
It exists in families, businesses, and most organizations throughout the
world.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are places in the world where young children grow up
with addictive foods or drinks and then find it difficult to fully accept the
gospel because of those addictions.Â  We have a wonderful Word of Wisdom to help
us avoid such trials if we use it properly.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many cultures place either the man or the woman in a
position to rule over the other sex.Â  The Lord said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Therefore shall a man leave his father

<p class="MsoNormal">We are commanded to be unified as one in our marriage even
while keeping our own personalities and attributes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We could continue on in describing the many aspects of
cultures that have developed throughout the world.Â  One thing would become very
evident and that is that in every single part of this world the influence of the
adversary is very apparent.Â  There are accepted ways of life contrary to the
gospel of Jesus Christ.Â  This has been true throughout history.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The scriptures tell of the terrible effect on the Lamanites
from incorrect traditions that caused them to become disobedient, ignorant and

<p class="MsoNormal">In the New Testament the Savior reproved the Pharisees for
their false traditions and idle ceremonies which kept them from accepting him

<p class="MsoNormal">Even Paul the Apostle said <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>How

<p class="MsoNormal">Prophets, past and current, have cautioned us to look
carefully at the world around us.Â  They have counciled us to decide what we can
accept and what we must change in our own way of living if we are to be in

<p class="MsoNormal">Just a few of the many other scriptures of encouragement to
separate from the world around us:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Come out from among them, and be ye

<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord said to Emma Smith, <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>And

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A wonderful quote on this topic comes from a marvelous talk
President Hinckley gave at a recent general priesthood meeting when he said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Brethren, be strong.Â  Rise above the
evils of the world.Â  We need not be prudish.Â  We need not adopt a
holier-than-thou attitude.Â  We need only let our personal integrity, our sense
of right and wrong, and simple honesty govern our actions.Â  Let us live the
gospel in our homes<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y</span>simply
do what is right and let the consequences follow...someday you will grow old
and look back upon your life.Â  You will be able to say <span style='font-family:

not even myself.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><sup>(17)</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even with all the encouragement given by great leaders, we
note that counsel has been ignored by almost everyone who has been on the
earth.Â  Instead, they have found comfort in following the traditions of their
fathers and living as those around them live.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord knew this would be a problem for many when He said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Enter ye in at the strait gate: for
wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In our time on the earth, the gulf is widening between the
world and the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
kingdom.Â  The culture about us is changing rapidly while the ways and words of
the Lord remain as they have always been.Â  It is becoming impossible to
straddle that gulf.Â  But it seems only a few are able to cling to the iron rod
consistently.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is interesting to compare commandments given from the
beginning of life with the world around us today.Â  The Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s commandments have not
been rescinded for He is the same today as yesterday and forever.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Can we possibly believe we, today, are so different<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>B</span>that we have become wiser

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What we often forget is that the results of many decisions
are based on laws irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this

of the devil<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>Y@</span><sup>(19)</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For a moment or two, let<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
look at the culture many of you are living in right now.Â  This is a beautiful
world, and we live at a most wonderful time.Â  There are more comforts and
knowledge than have ever been available on this earth.Â  We have the restored
gospel, temples, prophets, seers and revelators to bless our lives.Â  We know of
the Atonement and of the potential of a remarkable future.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">America is the most powerful and probably the most wonderful
nation ever on this earth.Â  It has allowed the creation of leadership and
resources so the kingdom of God on earth has progressed in spreading throughout
the world. Â Our leaders are trying in their way to bring peace to the world.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But even this is not the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
culture as we know it will be.Â  It is a democracy rather than a theocracy.Â  It
thrives on competition and survival of the fittest.Â  Greatness is measured by
money, influence, beauty, or athleticism.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It harbors an obvious increase in immodesty, pollutions of
many kinds, and addictions.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our challenge is to find how to benefit from the wonderful
things available to us and separate from those that take us away from the
Savior.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many practices used in business and government in this
culture are not those we should use for church or family leadership.Â  And yet,
even within the Church, I often find in some people<span style='font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s eyes the worldly concept that the calling
given to a person is a measurement of their worthiness and spirituality.Â  In
the oath and covenant of the priesthood the Lord tells of marvelous blessings
available to us, but they are based on having priesthood and the magnifying of
callings, not the callings themselves.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of the most spiritual people I know have never even
held what some would call a significant position, but they have magnified every
assignment they have had, no matter what it was.Â  I have no question of the
wonderful blessings awaiting them because they understand and live as the Lord
would have them live.Â  Transition to his kingdom in heaven will be easy for
them.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As soon as we enter our homes or fill our church callings,
we should be living by principles from the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
culture.Â  We need to live successfully in our neighborhood and in the business
community, but that can be done without compromising the standards that should
be ours.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One common characteristic in our world is seeking for
immediate gratification of every desire.Â  We immediately want a nice home, well
furnished, a new car, gadgets, and a leisurely life.Â  Such immediate pleasures
seem more appealing than working for a promised joy that seems a long way off.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That is one of Satan<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
great tools while the Lord teaches us that we are on an eternal quest of
patiently and consistently striving for blessings far beyond anything even
imaginable here.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We live in a world where terrible social problems are
treated from the wrong end.Â  We enact a plethora of laws, raise armies, and
spend billions of dollars in a search for peace and harmony.Â  Our prophets
teach that the solution to most of life<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
problems comes by developing families on a solid foundation.Â  It is much wiser
and better to prevent problems than attempt to cure them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have been told that a major cause of bankruptcies comes
from young people not taking time to pay off their expenses of education before
they launch into buying many worldly things.Â  They hear about easy credit, low
interest rates, and imagine how impressive they can be with a new this or new
that.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But latter-day prophets have pled with all their strength
for us to avoid debt like we would a plague, separate wants from real needs,
and live within our means.Â  The worst use of money is to pay interest because
there is absolutely nothing to show for it.Â  You will find tremendous
temptations to spend money you don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
have, but you will not find lasting happiness and peace by giving in to those
appetites.Â  This is especially true if you pass off your obligations and
responsibilities to someone else because you did not keep your promises.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many want to live with all the comforts their parents have
obtained over the years.Â  They may feel their own importance is determined by
the size of their home or the neighborhood in which they live or the car they
drive.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
see anywhere where the Lord uses such measurements to determine our worth or
the blessings He would shower upon us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In recent years, traditions of proper marriage and family
life have undergone drastic and terrible changes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many young people put off marriage or having children until
they feel they are financially sound or have had what they call a good time.Â 
This thinking has even crept within the Church.Â  Many missionaries spend two
years encouraging others to live gospel principles.Â  Then too many of them come
home and delay far too long in keeping one of the most important of all
commandments and opportunities--that of creating an eternal family.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Voices in the world tell you children are a huge expense or
very restricting to your lifestyle.Â  Many think they can substitute pets for
children.Â  But if we listen to the Lord, we understand the major purpose of
life is to create eternal families and to multiply and replenish the earth.Â  We
know the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall
prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth
them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Far too often parents feel it is better to give a lot of
material goods to one or two children than to give life to more.Â  Others may
feel they show love for children by purchasing everything the child can
possibly imagine.Â  In doing so, they take away initiative and a sense of values
from the child that are so important in the building of his character.Â  Real
love is evidenced by our deeds and teachings.Â  It can not be purchased or sold.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My wife and I have had the privilege of knowing many
wonderful couples who have felt the most important thing they could do is raise
spiritually mature children.Â  It is interesting to know many of them who lived
meagerly but seemed to have sufficient for their needs.Â  The children grew with
a good sense of values and initiative.Â  Those parents are now enjoying
marvelous blessings and joy in their posterity.Â  The luxuries they didn<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t have are long since
forgotten.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I will never forget the conversation I had with Stake
President Tukuafu in Tonga as we stood outside his lovely home.Â  It looked out
over an inlet of the Pacific Ocean on the island of Tongatapu.Â  He told me this
was the property his parents owned when he was young.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They had built a small home on it in which they had raised
their large family.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He told of the day a family council was called and his
mother and father told all their children of a decision they had made.Â  They
knew the most important blessing they could give to their family was for all of
them to be sealed in the temple.Â  The problem was that the closest temple then
was in New Zealand, and the only way they could afford to go there was to sell
their home and everything they had.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He remembers the special experience at the temple in New
Zealand and then coming back to Tonga and living in a makeshift hut.Â  As time
went on, president Tukuafu was able to get some education, start a construction
business, and begin raising his own family.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By unusual circumstances, the original home and property his
parents had sold became available for him to purchase and he did so.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I looked around at how he had expanded the home and the
beautiful care of the lovely grounds.Â  It has been a historic place to raise
his children with a constant reminder before them of the devotion and love of
wonderful ancestors.Â  President Tukuafu is an outstanding stake president and
one of the sweetest and most humble men I have met.Â  He paid great tribute to
his parents by what he said and the way he has lived.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some parents will never understand how the Lord helps us do
what may seem difficult if they always put their own convenience ahead of
fulfilling life<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
purposes and relying on him.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There has been a determined effort to confuse the roles of
men and women as God intended them.Â  The confusion has crept into our way of
life in very obvious ways.Â  Great determination is required to keep our family
life as clarified in a powerful declaration to the world from the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s representatives on the
earth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In this culture around us, the basic ten commandments have
been trampled and ignored.Â  Just as prophesied, many call good evil and evil
good.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Positions, power, wealth, praise of man, recreation, and
many other quests have become Gods and idols to men and women.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is appalling to constantly hear the Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s name being taken in vain
in everyday conversation.Â  Most people cannot even express surprise without
referring to deity.Â  When language becomes crude and base, there is always a
lowering of spirituality and dignity in that society.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The holy Sabbath has become a day of work or recreation or
entertainment.Â  There is encouragement all around to do something other than to
spend the day in worshipping and developing spiritual strength as a family.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An understanding of true love has been replaced by lust.Â 
The Lord<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s standard
that we are to have sexual relations only with our husband or wife to whom we
are legally and lawfully wedded has never changed.Â  Mankind thinks they can
change that standard, but man has no right to do so.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Hinckley reminds us very forcefully: <span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>We believe in chastity
before marriage and total fidelity after marriage.Â  That sums it up.Â  That is
the way to happiness in living.Â  That is the way to satisfaction.Â  It brings
peace to the heart and peace to the home.<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><sup>(20)</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You may not have much temptation toward lying, killing,
stealing, or other common vices of our day.Â  But coveting can be a major
problem even for faithful saints.Â  It is closely allied to pride which is the
greatest trial for all of us in these latter days.Â  It is sad to see someone
who is unhappy because of what they don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
have rather than rejoicing in what they do have.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cheating and violence are often the means of achieving
selfish desires.Â  Sometimes they are justified as a religious concept.Â  But we
understand we should only do to others as we would like them to do to us--along
with a reminder that without charity we are nothing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fine arts have been a means of praising God and noble
aspects of life.Â  Since we are able to remember words to songs almost better
than anything else, it has been a wonderful way to teach great truths to
children.Â  Fine arts have been the frosting of life.Â  But our culture includes
art and entertainment of every kind that is debasing and crude.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The problem is that whatever goes into our mind becomes the
source of many of our thoughts and later our actions.Â  It takes great
determination to avoid viewing anything that fills our mind with telestial
thoughts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We are often very careful to plan out every moment of our
lives and then live by that plan no matter what comes.Â  Life is lived far
better by keeping room open always for guidance of the spirit or callings of
priesthood leaders to make course adjustments when they are appropriate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In our early married life, we had an experience that was
very uncomfortable at the time but which turned out to be a significantly
wonderful teaching moment for us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We had just finished my service in the army during the
Korean War and two years of graduate school.Â  We had struggled to come up with
a $250 down payment on a very small home but had no money for furnishings or
landscaping or much else.Â  Then we found we had moved into a stake with a very
heavy financial debt.Â  Those were the days when members contributed to ward and
stake budget programs and construction of new meetinghouses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I remember the pleas from stake leaders to contribute
generously toward payment of $125,000 debt on a meetinghouse used by eight
wards so we could then build other much needed buildings.Â  We said if we had
some money, we would like to help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then President Joseph Fielding Smith came to our stake
conference.Â  I don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
remember all he said, but we will never forget one phrase he used.Â  He promised
us that it would be impossible to ever get the Lord in our debt.Â  Whatever we
did for his work would always come back to us in greater measure if we did it
with a willing heart.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My wife and I looked at each other with the feeling those
words were just for us.Â  We met with the bishop and told him we would
contribute a sizeable amount within a certain time.Â  We had no idea how we
would do it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A few days after meeting with the bishop, I received a call
from a dear friend.Â  His company was doing a project that for several reasons
had to be done at night when his staff would not be there.Â  It was in line with
skills I had developed.Â  Would I come several nights a week and supervise the
work?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the project was completed, I made an account of what
additional income it had unexpectedly brought to me.Â  It was then I realized
what President Smith had said.Â  The gross income minus taxes, tithing etc left
a net slightly more than what we committed and paid to the building fund.Â  We also
found unexpected ways to meet other expenses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There have been other times we have been asked to do
something by a priesthood leader that was contrary to our plans or looked to be
beyond our abilities.Â  But each time we have thought back on President Smith<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s promise and found the
Lord will not ask us to do something unless he will also help us accomplish
what he has asked.Â  It is not always a dollar for dollar arrangement.Â  But when
we try to do his will and help in his great work, there will be blessings found
in return that always exceed in value what we have given.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The promise is made to all.Â  You will never get the Lord in
debt to you for you will always receive more blessings than whatever you may
give.Â  But it requires allegiance to him, not to the culture around us or to
our own prideful desires.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In many ways you have come at a most wonderful time in the
history of this world.Â  Obviously it is a time of preparing for the Savior<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s second advent to the
earth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That means it is a time of separating the sheep from the
goats.Â  You will face many influences that can draw you away from the most
wonderful blessings ever promised.Â  Some of those influences will be very
subtle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They may even come from family or close friends to do what
everyone else is doing.Â  You won<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
even recognize what is happening unless you seek for guidance of the spirit in
everything you do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are many more aspects of this culture and others in
our world that take away light and truth.Â  We don<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>t
have time to review all of them but the humble souls who truly want to seek
first for the kingdom of God, in all they do, will have promptings and insights
that will help them through mortality in the best way possible.Â  They could be
the ones who are able to put off the natural man, which is an enemy to God, and
become saints through the atonement of Christ the Lord.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can be swallowed up in the culture in which you live and
say this is the thing to do because everyone is doing it.Â  If you succumb to
that, the evil one will deprive you of light and truth and you will have chosen
a course of mediocrity.Â  You will have made the same mistake many others have
made before you by choosing the wide gate and broad way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I indicated earlier, the key is to keep a vision of who
you are, what you can be, and how to get there.Â  Let virtue garnish thy
thoughts unceasingly and the blessings will come.Â  You will find the peace that
only the Lord can give.Â  It will not come from anything you purchase or any
praise of man, but from the quiet assurance of the spirit whispering - well
done thou good and faithful servant.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Where do we begin?Â  In our own homes and apartments.Â  We
must learn to be earnest in our prayers, trying to draw nearer to our God.Â  We
try to master the principles of patience, forgiveness, repentance, and true
love as taught by the Savior.Â  They come line upon line and precept upon
precept.Â  We never know the truth of his words until we actually live them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We strive to make the temple the center of our life for that
is where we receive vision of our life<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span>s
purpose and a base for making good decisions.Â  Wherever we are, we try to be
kind and thoughtful to all but always choose as the Lord would have us choose
in all we say and do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Savior spoke of being a light unto the world.Â  Anyone
who lives as the Lord has commanded will be in obvious contrast to the
surrounding culture as a light shining in darkness.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Abinidi may not have known what effect he would have on alma,
but an entire civilization was blessed by what he did when the culture in which
he lived was contrary to all he believed in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the final days of his life on the earth the Savior
offered a beautiful prayer to his Father in Heaven.Â  His words could apply to
his apostles then or to us now as he said to his Father -</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">I have given them thy word; and the
world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of
the world.Â  I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that
thou shouldest keep them from the evil.<sup>(21)</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Each of us determines how we will spend our time on earth.Â 
We are confronted every day by decisions.Â  Many of the temptations to do
sinfully are very obvious.Â  But remember you can also lose light and truth or
the glory of God by allowing yourself to be caught up in the thinking and ways
of the culture in which you live.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You and I have the true gospel, the good words of God, that
have been restored to enlighten us.Â  We have prophets, seers and revelators to
help us understand how to apply these truths to our daily living.Â  Like few
others that have inhabited this earth, we should know the very best way to
live.Â  May you have the testimony and determination to do so.Â  I declare I know
the Lord lives and has given us the way to return to him.Â  I pray for all of us
to seek first for His kingdom and live his ways, in the name of Jesus Christ
amen.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><strong><em>"HUMOR IN THE BIBLE"</em></strong><br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p align="CENTER">Brigham Young University-Idaho Forum<br />
July 17, 2003<br />
Dr. Steven C. Walker<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>It's a joy to be here with you. Some of my best friends, student and faculty, call BYU-Idaho
home, so this feels like homecoming to me. I suspect you come today as you would come to a
rumor of Elvis sightings or UFOs or maybe werewolves glimpsed at the mall: You're not so
huge fans of about humor in the Bible, just surprised that there might actually be any. I promise
we'll find some. There really is humor in the Bible. What is more, because scripture has the
astonishing capacity to change the way we see, if you are able to discover humor in the scripture
with me this afternoon, it's likely to change your life.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I hope today to make you capable of reading God's good word relevantly to you, to do as Nephi
advises us: to liken the scriptures to ourselves. I've known enough of your classmates to know
you're superb readers. But you could read scripture better. In the next half hour, you will.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>When it comes to biblical humor, we miss the point. In fact, we mostly miss the humor. The
Bible is the last place most modern readers would find a laugh. And the main reason we fail to
find humor there is that the Bible is the last place we'd look. Given how persistently humor
smiles and chuckles and sometimes laughs right out loud in virtually every book of the Bible, it's
remarkable how consistently we manage to overlook it. It's also unfortunate. Humor informs
biblical texts. To miss the humor of the Bible is to miss not only much of its fun, but much of its
meaning.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Take, for example, <em>Jonah</em>. Every scene in this prophetic book invites a smile - the picture of the
reluctant prophet, for instance, fresh from the belly of the whale: reeking of whale vomit, trailing
seaweed and barnacles and old fishheads, bleached of all his color by gastric juices, robe shrunk
up to his knees and elbows, way bad hair day, not only disheveled but seriously disgruntled,
trudging ornery into Nineveh muttering his message of doom in a language the Ninevites can't
even understand.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Scenes like that dominate the book. The first chapter alone sets up enough ridiculous situations
for a Marx Brothers movie. God orders: "Go east," Jonah goes due west, as far as he can. God
threatens Jonah with a "mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken" [1:4];
Jonah, unfazed as a five-year-old, remains "fast asleep." God gets into a water fight with Jonah
just so He can rescue him. And the means of that rescue? Angelic life preserver? Submarine?
Trained porpoise? Nope: the distressingly uncomfortable and disgustingly smelly "belly of the
fish" [1:17].<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>From its opening parody of the prophetic call to the final picture of those "much cattle" [4:1]
penitently attired in sackcloth and ashes, <em>Jonah</em> is a funny book. And the funniness matters. The
humor in <em>Jonah</em> is not incidental, not superficial decoration. The humor is not only fun, but
functional. There is a moral to the <em>Jonah</em> joke.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>To a Hebrew of the fifth century BC, the very premise of the story is absurd. <em>Jonah</em> is a
midrashic tale, in the usual form of "imagine if." But in <em>Jonah</em>'s case the "imagine if" is
unimaginable. The story's situation is impossible for <em>Jonah</em>'s Hebrew audience; the narrative is
for the Israelite of the time an invitation to think about the unthinkable. What if God offered
repentance to the worst people in the world? He wouldn't. Even if He did, they couldn't. But in
<em>Jonah</em> they do. The opening scene sets the humorous tone, playing with biblical convention. The
first thing we see in <em>Jonah</em> is a parody of the prophetic call. Prophetic convention dictated a
certain shy reluctance in responding to the Lord's call: Even the great Moses tried to get out of
being prophet on grounds of stuttering. But when the Lord calls Jonah, he refuses to answer at
all. Even the silence here has a grin in it, like silence after "Do you take this woman to be your
lawfully wedded wife?" (Miles 172)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>There's another indication that the humor of the book of <em>Jonah</em> is deliberate: it's climactic; it
gets funnier as it goes along. The concluding statement is almost a punch line: "And should not
I" God wonders out loud to Jonah in that closing verse, "spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein
are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their
left hand; and also much cattle?" (Jonah 4:11)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>The numbers insult Jonah's accountant mentality: The quality of mercy is not strained, let alone
the quantity. That can't-tell-left-from-right comment suggests Jonah, like thickheaded Ninevites,
"may not know his gourd from a hole in the ground" (Whitney 1) Funnier still to me is that
"much cattle." I see God grinning like a Cheshire cat in that sidelong glance at livestock: "Jonah,
I'd save the city for the sake of its camels and its cats, its rabbits and its rats, its cockroaches and
its bats, let alone its people. Especially," the text smiles between its understated lines, "when
those camels are so humbly dressed in sackcloth."<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>God's explaining the joke to Jonah is a little like David Letterman heightening the intensity of a
story by patiently pointing out the punchline to Paul Shafer. There is strong implication here of
divine joshing: "The reason you have no compassion, Jonah, is that you have no sense of
humor."<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>So the biggest joke in <em>Jonah</em> is the topsy-turvy moral of the story: Jonah, condemning God,
seems to us to commend Him. Jonah's upset God won't kill the Ninevites, like He promised.
God's gentle response to Jonah's anger has to have a smile in it: "Doest thou well to be angry?"
[4:4] "Isn't mercy more fun than justice?" Jonah insists on telling God how to be God, so God
tells Jonah how to be human. God invites Jonah out of his narrow theological certainties into
life, into that risky and uncertain human life where things get iffy and as a result potentially
funny. The message of the book of <em>Jonah,</em> delivered with a divine smile, directly contrasts
Jonah's sullen message of doom: The God of Jonah urges us to expect the unexpected. Jonah
reads that moral as "damned if you do and damned if you don't." We read it as God does:
"Blessed even if you don't; <em>way</em> blessed if you do."<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Life with the God of <em>Jonah</em> is not far from the proverbial view of heaven: "better than we could
ever imagine, and full of wonderful surprises." Those surprises may be chancy business, like
casting lots on a deck pitching in a storm so wildly the dice don't have to be thrown. That
undependability is an understandable threat to Jonah. But to us it is also a promise of fuller
possibilities, of God "come that ye might have life, and have it more abundantly." (John 10:10) </p>
<p>The humor of the book of <em>Jonah</em> urges us in the direction of that abundance of life. The laughter
encourages us to find a way to laugh at ourselves, to laugh off our restrictive expectations, to
laugh away our confining certitudes about our just desserts. Things may not be as bound by our
expectations as we expect. Things may be a whole lot better than we've dreamed.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>The smiling God of <em>Jonah</em> is closer to us than we'd thought. Divine and human meet in scripture
in humor. Being "vomited out" by a great fish [2:10] is for Jonah trauma tinged with insult -"here's another fine mess you've gotten me into." But for God the vomiting is, like all of His
acts in the book, an act of compassion. For the whale it's gotta be a relief -Jonah may have been
"the worst case of indigestion he ever had" (Miller 1) For us, standing precariously between
divine love and mortal limitation, that juxtaposition of sublime possibilities with ridiculous
actualities puts us in the place of lifelike humor.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>The Bible-the King James Version of the Bible- is the perennial and all-time bestselling book in
the United States and throughout the world -eleven million copies in a single recent year alone.
<em>Harry Potter</em> doesn't come close. At the same time the Bible is the most bought book, it may
also enjoy the single honor of being the least read book in the world, with legendary capacity for
gathering dust on bookshelves. The Bible tends to be less of a spiritual stimulant than a physical
sedative: nine out of ten people reading the Bible at any given time are asleep. Maybe part of the
reason we're sleeping through our Bible reading is that we're failing to see what's in it. One
thing we're failing to see in the Bible is its humor. Let's look for that humor where it's least
likely to be found -a long way from Jonah, in the most august volume in the New Testament: if
it's in Acts, humor's everywhere in the Bible.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>We can't expect many belly laughs; Acts humor is warmer, more intimate - and also more close-to-the-bone crucial. But some of the humor, even in the dignified Acts of the Apostles, is hard to
miss.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Some humor in Acts is so obvious it approaches slapstick. When the seven sons of Sceva, for
instance, attempt in Acts 19 to go into the apparently profitable business of casting out spirits
"by Jesus whom Paul preacheth," one unimpressed spirit responds: "Jesus I know, and Paul I
know; but who are ye?" Then in a scene fit for a Keystone Cops comedy "The man in whom the
evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them and prevailed against them, so that they fled
out of that house naked and wounded." (Acts 19:13-16) <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Maybe you have to be sadistic to think that's funny. Usually in the New Testament to notice the
humor you just have to be sensitive, to be alert-basically you have to be awake. In this
understated context where there is little "sounding brass and tinkling cymbals" but rather a
stillness that runs deep, the subtler the humor the more significant.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Take the way, for example, humor in Acts quietly characterizes Peter, humanizing him,
endearing him to us as it vivifies his character.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>The Peter of Acts, as befits the neophyte prophet of the fledgling church, is presented as a
Rodney Dangerfield "I don't get no respect" kind of guy. Peter is portrayed as decidedly lacking
in dignity, a portrait that comports well with the psychological probabilities of a prophet with no
prior role models, a guy who gets drafted off a fishing boat - and a Galilean at that, when
<em>Galilean</em> was synonymous with <em>hick.</em><br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>The brashly confident leader of tough fishermen finds himself suddenly awkward in the more
sensitive role of God's "fisher of men" (Matt. 4:19) That's fine literary effect: the portrait of a
put-upon Peter showing the apostle's bumbling struggle for spiritual mastery, provides for us
New Testament readers practical experience of the strong man become meek in Christ: If Peter
can do it, we can do it.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Acts frankly admits that Peter does it awkwardly. He has trouble getting the feel of the dignity of
his position. When Christ healed the man by the pool at Bethesda He sent him off with a fitting
flourish: "Arise, take up thy bed, and walk." (John 5:8) Peter under precisely parallel
circumstances, perhaps appalled by the untidy fact that his subject has lain eight years in the
same bed, says "Arise, and make thy bed." (Acts 9:34) And Peter gets no respect. Even from
angels, Peter gets no respect. Peter lies asleep in prison when an angelic visitor comes to rescue
him. When the divine light shining in the prison fails to wake snoring Peter, the angel resorts to
less subtle measures: "He smote Peter on the side." [12:7] Still sleepy, the prophet has to be
instructed first to put on his sandals, then to don his robe. [8] Not until he is outside on the street,
the angel gone, does Peter "come to himself." [11] And only after he has "considered the thing"
[12] does Peter realize he has actually escaped from prison.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>That Mike Myers portrait of a man sleepwalking through his own dramatic rescue doesn't end at
the prison gates. Fresh from his miraculous escape from prison, he knocks at Mark's house,
where the faithful are gathered praying for his release. [12] "And as Peter knocked at the door of
the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. And when she knew Peter's voice, she
opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate," (Acts
12:13-14) leaving the prophet, who's just had prison doors opened for him by angels, to cool his
heels outside. Luke proclaims, with what has to be a twinkle in his eye, "Peter continued
knocking." [16] Acts' portrait of Paul is even more pointed than its picture of bumbling Peter.
Paul is, in the perspective of Acts, precisely what we perceive him to be throughout the whole of
the New Testament, though we may be too polite to put it so bluntly as Acts does: Paul is a man
of many words.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Acts is fitting prelude to the New Testament epistles in its stress upon Paul's much speaking.
Again and again Acts makes pointedly the point that Paul talks too much: Acts 17: Paul
"disputed ... daily." [17] In Acts 18, when the Lord, Who really ought to know better, enjoins
Paul to "hold not thy peace," Paul takes Him at His word and preaches for "a year and six
months" [10-11], possibly nonstop. Acts 19: Paul "spake boldly for the space of three months."
And in the next verse we see him "disputing daily," and in the next verse are informed "this
continued for the space of two years." [8-10] Acts 20: Paul declares that his disciples should
"remember" - and if they forget he'll be sure to remind them - "that by the space of three years I
ceased not to warn every one night and day" (Acts 20:31) and day and night and on and on and
on. Paul just can't shut up. Imprisoned on charges of preaching, he converts the jailor, then prays
aloud and sings-at midnight. [16:25] When church leaders send him by night to avoid the Jews,
outspoken Paul, unable to forego any chance to talk, ends up in the synagogue preaching to -who
else?-the Jews. [17:10] And in Lystra, where the local citizens become convinced Paul and
Barnabus are "the gods. . .come down to us in the likeness of men," they figure Paul must be
Mercurius, "because he was the chief speaker." [14:11-12] Preaching against pagan gods, Paul's
mistaken for one - the talkative one.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>All this playing upon Paul's much speaking frames that delightful incident in Acts 20 at the
regional conference meeting when Paul "continued his speech until midnight." [20:7] "And there
sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul
was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken
up dead." (Acts 20:9)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I don't mean to laugh at Eutychus's misfortune, but I love the picture of the apostle of the Lord
having to interrupt his sermon to raise from the dead the man he has killed by his long speaking.
And so has he learned his lesson, this apostolic windbag? Does Paul repent of speaking
overmuch, never again to talk a fellow Christian to death? That very night, Acts informs us
dryly, Paul "talked a long while, even until break of day." [11] <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Acts has a lot of fun with this: Paul talks too much. Peter bumbles. And all that teasing of Peter
and smiling at Paul isn't there simply for the fun of it: the whimsy, as usual with New Testament
humor, accumulates to insight. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Most Christian theologians attach more importance to Paul than to Peter, feeling Paul did more
to shape the early church - mainly, and this isn't much of a simplification - because Paul talks
more than Peter does. The humor corrects that theology: Peter, less sophisticated and much less
verbal than Paul, is actually in charge: God's spokesman is not heard for his much speaking.
Peter doesn't speak as much nor with as much polish, but when he speaks, we do well to listen.
Paul gets more media time in Acts than Peter not because he is more important, but because he is
in fact more peripheral: more show, but less go. Peter does not demand our respect; Paul clamors
much more noisily for our attention. But it may be that Peter, ultimately, has more to say to us.
That's easy to miss. The humor, the deeper insight, the relevance to our lives - those "things that
are more excellent" in the Bible are easy to overlook. We might be missing that good stuff
because we read for duty rather than for joy: <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>"If your nose is close to the grindstone rough and you hold it down there long enough, three
things will all your world compose: the stone, the ground, and your darned old nose." <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>So there we have it: there's humor in the Bible, To miss it is to miss crucial biblical meaning.
We read better simply by recognizing the possibility that the humor is there. We read deeper
when we pick up on humorous implications. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Let's look to just one more example of biblical humor in an even less likely place. Let's look at
how humor illuminates women in the Bible. That's right: Not only are there laughs in the Bible,
there are women. It's amazing, given how long some of us have been reading the Bible, how
much we've failed to notice them. It might be part of our problem is we know them too well.
Maybe our very familiarity with the Bible has bred contempt, a sense we need no longer look at
it because we already know what is there. Maybe the Bible is so much a part of our culture we
don't even have to read it to be convinced we've read enough of it. Most Americans know before
they are old enough to read who Eve is and who Sarah is and who Rebekah is. We know not only
who Moses is, but who Miriam is, who Zipporah is, maybe even who Jochebed is-who Moses's
mother and wife are, as well as his sister. We know the Bible so well that when we come to
actually read it we might be seeing not what is there on its pages but what we already know
about it. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>You look less than convinced that we could actually look at a page of the Bible and fail to see
what's standing right there in front of us. Let me give you a for instance: <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>&quot;When I was writing lessons for the Relief Society, it was decided that we should have a lesson
on patriarchal government in the family and use the relationship of Abraham and Sarah as
example of the best of all possible marriages. I jumped at the chance: I like Abraham a lot, and
Sarah even better, and I feel the Bible describes a wonderful working relationship in their
marriage. But it became apparent in our planning that the point the committee wanted expressed
in the lesson was that the husband is in charge in the home - it is for husbands to decree, for
wives to obey: like Abraham.&quot;<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>When I laughed because I thought that not at all like Abraham in the Bible, my fellow writers
really got on me: They said unkindly things, things like: "If the greatest of patriarchs won't do as
a model of patriarchy, who will?" I've deep respect for those readers: They're diligent readers,
faithful readers, expert readers. Yet I thought they were failing to see what was there, right there
in Genesis. It seemed to me from looking at the Bible itself that if we were to insist upon
Abraham as a model for our idea of patriarchy, we needed to reexamine our idea of what
patriarchy is.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Abraham just doesn't sound like the macho master of Sarah when we listen to what Genesis
actually says. We need to hear Genesis 16 aloud, preferably in a female voice, as sassy a Sarah
sort of voice as we can manage: And Sarai said unto Abram, "Behold now, the Lord hath
restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children
by her." And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. (Genesis 16:2)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Who's calling the shots here? What does the text actually say? And he went in unto Hagar, and
she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee. (Genesis 16:4-5)  I recognize we're
thousands of years from the cultural context, but I swear I've heard that voice as recently as this
week, as familiarly as my own marriage. It sounds disturbingly, to me, like "It's your fault,
husband." Is it indeed Abraham's fault? Whose idea was this? <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>And how does patriarchal Abraham respond, he with all the cultural, all the marital power, here?
"Get thee hence, wife?" "No way, Sarah, it was actually <em>your</em> idea?"  "I'm in charge here, I pay
the bills and make the hard decisions, and I'll do what I like?"  But Abram said unto Sarai,
behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with
her, she fled from her face, (Genesis 16:6)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>That can't, I think, have pleased this new father, childless so long, his life so recently refreshed
by new love and by the renewed possibility, at long last, of the much-desired child. Abraham
can't have enjoyed seeing Sarah abuse Hagar, much less watching Ishmael kicked out of the
camp. Yet he scrupulously avoids pulling rank on his wife. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I swear to you that Genesis 16 came with my own conservative King James Version. I didn't
write it in. It's right there in the book: Abraham is not independently calling the familial shots. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>It's just as clearly there in Genesis 18, a couple of decades later when so much has changed with
the couple that their names are altered to reflect the changes. When angels come to announce the
impending birth of Isaac, "Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind" the angel. She's
eavesdropping, right? And she, even in the face of these awesome announcers, dares to doubt:
Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after
the manner of women. (Genesis 18:11)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Since she's no longer menstruating, she feels the likelihood of having a child may be somewhat
diminished: Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have
pleasure, my lord being old also? (Genesis 18:12)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>And since she and her husband are no longer making love - Sarah wryly hints Abraham may not
even be up to it - the chances of pregnancy are further reduced. I can't help but like the woman's
tone - the honesty of it, the realistic practicality of it, the humor of it. After severe rebuke from
"The Lord" Himself to Abraham on the issue of Sarah's disbelief: Then Sarah denied, saying, "I
laughed not". (Genesis 18:5)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>You see what she's doing? Can you believe this Sarah, this woman they wanted to pose as a
model of wifely passivity? She's arguing, arguing with the Lord. I'm surprised the Lord gets the
last word. You'll notice Abraham, knowing her more intimately than the angel does, stays out of
the quarrel altogether.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Sarah's not the only funny woman in the Bible. One of the strongest recurrent patterns of
Genesis, so strong as to become a motif throughout the Bible, is that women start things - Bright,
right, things like quarrels. Things like trouble. But also things like families. Also things like
expansion of human horizons.  In Genesis the most notable narrative characteristic of women is
that they initiate the narrative action. Every single Genesis woman: Eve, Rebekah, Rachel, Leah,
Tamar, Hagar - gets things going. The pattern is straightforward and insistent; the bare outline
will bring a dozen examples to mind: [1] A <strong>MAN</strong> is presented [2] - he's stable, orthodox,
<strong>STATIC</strong>. [3] A <strong>WOMAN</strong> enters the scene. [4] The plot thickens: She outflanks him,
outmaneuvers him - <strong>TRICK</strong>ing him or manipulating him or seducing him - often all three - [5]
and the world <strong>CHANGE</strong>s, [6] changes always for the <strong>BETTER</strong>. Eve sets the pattern, that so-obvious pattern we've so obviously overlooked. That good man Adam is alone in the garden and
things are quiet and calm - tranquil, serene. Then Eve arrives on the scene and gets things going.
And they really go: life gets distressingly complicated with worries about what we'll have for
dinner and exactly what leaf we'll wear and where we're going to live.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>It is clearly Eve who does the complicating. It is she who debates with the serpent; it is she who
is the logician, the scriptorian. It is she who makes the decision to eat the fruit, to take the risk, to
go for the gusto.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Eve as seen in Genesis is inquisitive, imaginative, intellectual, ambitious, aggressive, daring,
independent, aware. Most dramatically, Eve is, both before and after the eating of the fruit,
responsible - and this in a situation where the most rabid feminist and the most orthodox
Christian would agree Adam is in charge. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>It's clear that without Eve this would be a very different story - might not even be a story.
Certainly it would be a far less lively story, because Eve initiates all the narrative action. The
dignified Adam, bless his orderly heart, doesn't do much.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Adam's a great guy, in his orthodox and obedient way, opting for things as they are. I relate with
Adam; I know exactly how he feels in the face of all these female complications, these womanly
urges yet once more to move the furniture. I hope for his sake that during these life-shaking
deliberations he is, as he appears in Genesis to be, off somewhere in the garden taking a nap. The
pivotal passage is Genesis 3:6: <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes,
and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also
unto her husband with her; and he did eat."<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Eve considers, deliberates, decides - she determines the fruit to be nutritious, satisfying,
edifying; she carefully, consciously, deliberately decides to eat it. How she got a reputation as a
Pandora airhead on the basis of that passage eludes me. She's willful, certainly, but anything but
witless. Adam follows along. In the Hebrew his non-deliberation is striking by contrast with
Eve's responsible agonizings: "And he," without a word of question or of acquiescence, with not
so much as an "Uh. OK," "did eat." Scripture includes more humor, to more purpose, than we've
noticed. When you start noticing, it's everywhere you look. Judges is funnier than Genesis, Luke
has more belly laughs than Acts, Esther is at least as comical as Jonah. Even staid Isaiah cracks
an occasional smile, as when that stern prophet describes the unfortunate Assyrian soldiers who,
in circumstances even more depressing than my Monday mornings, "When they arose early in
the morning behold, they were all dead corpses." (Isaiah 37:6)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I think the funniest book of all may be the Book of Mormon. You can't have read that without
noticing some really humorous passages. My students like the straightfaced logic of the Nephite
tactics with the poisoned wine: "For if it would poison a Nephite, behold, it would poison a
Lamanite." Or better still, that dramatic moment when Abinadi, after two years 
in exile enters King Noah's court in clever disguise, but, unaccustomed as he is 
to undercover work, blows his cover immediately by announcing first thing: &quot;I, 
Abinadi ...&quot;<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Much Book of Mormon humor is less obvious. Consider the inconvenience, for example, of how
the Jaredites - in their close-quartered boats "did carry with them swarms of bees." (Ether 2:3)
Or contemplate Moroni's modest declaration that he will "a few more things" before he gives us
twenty pages of some of the most densely packed insights in all scripture.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Or think for a moment about the instructions to the Brother of Jared in Ether 4 on the boat's
ventilation system: (Behold, thou shalt make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom; and when
thou shalt suffer for air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive air.)  And if it so be that the water
come in upon thee, behold - I'll bet they beheld, with rapt attention, as the water came pouring in
on them- ye shall stop the hole, that ye may not perish in the flood. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>If the plug lets in the ocean, Mahonri, you've opened the wrong end. Whatever laughter is here is
here not for laughter's sake so much as for taking us personally into the situation, helping us feel
the desperation of desert-dwelling definite nonsailors. These folks, who've never so much as
seen ocean before, are suddenly buried forty fathoms deep, wondering where their next breath is
coming from. The humor in the Book of Mormon, as throughout scripture, invites us to relate the
situations in the book to our own experience.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>There is humor in the scriptures. It's there for a purpose. Noticing it will make us more attentive
and more engaged readers. As surely as His prophet Gordon B. Hinckley, God has a sense of
humor. He may not be a stand-up comic, but He gets off some great lines. Whoever wrote His
book thinks humor matters. So do I: I think the funny stuff is in the Bible because God likes to
laugh and likes us to laugh. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I think He thinks the laughter can change our perspective. Biblical humor, like all humor, stands
our old expectations on their heads, forcing us to see our familiar world freshly. Bible laughter
jostles us into unfamiliar positions, unsettles our settled notions, twists our usual viewpoints
toward new insights. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Sassy Sarah talks back to the Lord. Tongue-tied Moses stutters into his status as God's greatest
spokesman. Impulsive Peter bumbles his way to outstanding leadership. Reluctant Jonah,
greatest missionary of all time, converts every single one of those nasty Ninevites so
convincingly they dress their cattle and camels and cats in sackcloth and ashes to prove their
utter repentance. The Good Book seems bent not so much on reinforcing what we already know
as on pushing the envelope of our possibilities. Everywhere you look in the Bible things get
turned upside down, inside out. Genesis begins with God turning the tables on the serpent, ends
with Joseph repaying brotherly treachery with compassion. In between those reversals Rebekah
tricks Isaac, Jacob tricks Esau, Leah tricks Jacob, Jacob tricks Laban, Laban tricks Jacob, Rachel
tricks Laban about the household idols, Simeon and Levi trick the Shechemites into getting
circumcised, Joseph's brothers trick Jacob about Joseph's seeming death. Meanwhile, every
single older sibling in Genesis, expectant of the birthright, gets displaced by a younger brother or
sister. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>The expected gets so consistently turned on its ear that reversal comes to look like the essence of
the Bible. Biblical narrative, when we see what's there instead of what we think ought to be
there, what we saw last time we read it, upsets what we anticipate as frequently and as
humorously as life does. We meet the very Master of the Universe Himself among the animals,
in a bed of straw, midst the smell of manure. No wonder we see again and again in the parables
of Jesus our expectations "turned upside down and questioned." (Crossan 6) Those reversals are
there to tell us something about ourselves. Notice how the scriptures always root for the
underdog? The serious implication of humor in the Bible is humbling the haughty and
encouraging the humble.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Esther, for instance: Looking at ambitious impious Esther, who sleeps with the judge to win the
beauty contest, we cannot but wonder how flawed a savior can be and still save. Esther's an
unobservant Jew; if she were Mormon we'd call her "inactive." Yet she saves her people. There
is humor in the human reality of the reversals of her narrative, Mordecai getting promoted as
Haman is hoist on his own petard. And in that humor there is hope for us: "Esther's very
ordinariness suggests that ordinary people too can rise to the moment and take on unexpected
strengths." (Fox 5) There is always, in the economy of Esther's God, hope that things could
change for the better. There is always, as in the worst of Jonah conditions, the possibility of
repentance, of improvement, of personal change. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Esther takes great risks. She risks becoming queen at hazard of spending the rest of her life in the
servile boredom of the king's harem. She risks her life to try to save her people: "If I perish, I
perish." Life's like that, the Bible is telling us: no guts, no glory. Just so our Bible reading, this
book insists in its every lively humorous reversal - our Bible reading is at its best not when it is
seeking the security of our customary readings but when it is taking chances.</p>
<p>Biblical humor urges us to open up to wider possibilities. Humor in the Bible tends to make us
think, and to think in new ways, bigger and better ways. Biblical humor at its best can open the
floodgates of our spiritual imaginations. Bottom line the humor in the Bible says: Anything can
happen. Scripture humor says with Shel Silverstein: Listen to the mustn'ts. Listen to the don'ts.
Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close
to me. Anything can happen:  Anything can be.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I pray we might notice the humor in scripture, so we can enjoy scripture more, so we will be able
to relate scripture better to ourselves. The humor in the Bible is there to teach us, ultimately, that
anything can be, anything can happen. <br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>My friends, my brothers and sisters: God is speaking to us through this book. He's speaking
really well, really helpfully. I pray that we might have ears to hear.<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>"Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not,
neither do they understand. But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear."
(Matthew 13:13,16)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p> And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand
persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?
(Jonah 4:11)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>I am come that ye might have life, and that ye might have it more abundantly. (John 10:10)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p> Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped
on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house
naked and wounded. (Acts 19:15-16)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>"Arise, take up thy bed, and walk."  (John 5:8)</p>
<p>"Arise, and make thy bed." (Acts 9:34)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. And
when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how
Peter stood before the gate. (Acts 12:13-14) Peter continued knocking. (Acts 12:16)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>By the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day. (Acts 20:31)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep:
and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and
was taken up dead. (Acts 20:9)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee,
go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the
voice of Sarai.  (Genesis 16:2)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her
mistress was despised in her eyes. And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee. (Genesis
16:4-5)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>But Abram said unto Sarai, behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And
when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face, (Genesis 16:6)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after
the manner of women. (Genesis 18:11)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my
lord being old also? (Genesis 18:12)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Then Sarah denied, saying, "I laughed not". (Genesis 18:5)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>MAN STATIC WOMAN TRICKY CHANGE BETTER<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes,
and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also
unto her husband with her; and he did eat. (Genesis 3:6)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>When they arose early in the morning behold, they were all dead corpses. (Isaiah 37:6)<br wp="BR2" />
</p>
<p>Behold, thou shalt make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom; and when thou shalt suffer for
air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive air. And if it so be that the water come in upon thee,
behold ye shall stop the hole, that ye may not perish in the flood. (Ether 2:20)</p>
<p>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not,
neither do they understand. But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: -20px">When one thinks of the number of prophet seers and revelators that have been at this pulpit, it could be intimidating.  But I have this hope that the spirit will make up the difference today.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I really am grateful to each of you for coming.   I had this vision of standing before an empty auditorium and needing to invite those on the stand to take a seat on the floor so I would not be speaking to an empty hall.  After all, when the speaker has a title like director of financial services, it likely does not engender images of a dynamic speaker.  My supervisor, who also has an accounting background, has commented on the power of an accounting personality.  He noted that having an accountant show up at a party is like having two really fun people leave.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I have some involvement in the investment process here at BYU-Idaho.  This afternoon I plan to teach using an analogy, comparing the temporal concepts of investing with spiritual objectives relating to investing in our eternal selves.  Perhaps you will learn some things that will improve your temporal well-being, but the overriding goal is to focus attention on the process of investing in our eternal lives.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Over the years I have read and studied the investment process in hopes of improving the long-term returns for the University.  In general, the accumulation of investment wealth is a function of three primary elements:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Capital invested - rate of return - elapsed time </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Capital invested in the temporal sense generally consists of the cash that one allocates for investment with the goal of increase by earning dividends, interest, rents, and other income or through asset appreciation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The rate of return in temporal investing is expected to be a function of risk, which often relates to volatility, and the level of confidence for expected return and the potential for loss.  The higher the volatility and greater the risk of loss, the higher the required rate of return expected by the investor.  In simple terms you cannot expect the return on your federally insured investment into a money market account to have the same upside potential as an investment in a new tech stock.  </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The elapsed time is the extended period over which the invested assets are allowed to grow/and compound.  The impact of the compounding of interest is a concept all of you should become familiar with.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As I have pondered the investment process, I have come to the conclusion that there are some significant similarities between the laws that govern the temporal investment process and those related to investing in our godly selves, or our eternal investment.  You are all familiar with the parable of the talents as found in Matthew 25.  You will recall that the master gave talents to three servants.  To one he gave five, to another two, and to another one talent.  As a youngster I always thought a talent referred to how well one might play the piano, paint, or sing; but during the New Testament era, a talent was a denomination of currency equal to 3000 shekels, which apparently was a considerable sum of money.  You will recall that two of the servants double the talents, but the third that had received one talent buried it in the ground out of fear of loss and received no increase.  What you may not remember is the penalty of his failure as found in Matthew 25:30.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness:  there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This sounds like pretty harsh treatment for being fearful of losing the talent, so I think we can safely assume there is more to this parable than first meets the eye.  The servantÂ’s sin was disobedience.  He knew his master, and his master had an expectation that during his absence the servant would do with the talent what the master would have done with the talent.  The servant clearly understood the masterÂ’s expectation and by accepting the talent agreed to those expectations.  He then did nothing.  This could be likened to those of us who come to know the Lord, make covenants, and then fail to keep them.  </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Lord has given each of us a talent or an asset that he expects us to use and invest wisely.  That asset is time.  It comes to us moment by moment in seconds, then minutes, then hours, days, months, and years.  We do not know how much we will receive in total.  Each morning we are given a fresh supply of investment capital, generally about sixteen waking hours. You may recall in the parable just discussed that the Lord gave no greater reward to the servant who doubled five talents than the one who doubled two.  They both entered into the joy of the Lord.  I think it is safe to say that a life of a few years can gain the same ultimate reward as a life of many years.  It depends simply on what we do with the time we are given.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In temporal investing, an increase in anyone of the three elements, capital invested, rate of return and elapsed time, results in an increase in the accumulation of wealth.  It is obvious that the more we invest, the more we should accumulate.  </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="CENTER">Examples of Investment Returns</p>
<p align="CENTER">Amount Invested</p>
<p>Rate of Return</p>
<p>Time Period</p>
<p>Final Value</p>
<p align="RIGHT">1,000.00</p>
<p>10%</p>
<p>45 years</p>
<p>73,890.48</p>
<p align="RIGHT">1,000.00</p>
<p>9%</p>
<p>45 years</p>
<p>48,327.28</p>
<p align="RIGHT">1,000.00</p>
<p>10%</p>
<p>35 years</p>
<p>28,104.43</p>
<p align="RIGHT">$1,000.00</p>
<p>10%</p>
<p>1 day</p>
<p>$  1,000.27</p>
<p>What is less obvious to some is the impact that the rate of return and the passage of time have on an investment.  By way of example using the chart being displayed, if you invested $1000 at age 20, by the time you were ready to retire at age 65, you would have over $73,000 on that single investment if you earned a 10 percent return each year.  Cut the rate to 9 percent and you have only about $48,000.  In this case, a 10 percent reduction in the rate of return results in a 34 percent decrease in the ultimate value of the asset.  </p>
<p>By keeping the rate at 10 percent but cutting the term to 35 years, you would have about $37,000.  So a 22 percent decrease in the time held results in about a 50 percent decrease in the ultimate value of the asset.  </p>
<p>The last line is an example of deathbed repentance.  If you invest $1000 at ten percent for one day, you gain 27 cents.  So whatÂ’s the point?  First of all, in planning your temporal investments, itÂ’s good to know that starting early is important and selecting good investments with a little higher return will make a significant difference.  These concepts are often referred to as the compounding of interest.</p>
<p>By way of example, letÂ’s suppose that somewhere in your life you will allocate 8,760 hours to the study of the scriptures.  This happens to be the time available in one full year.  If you invest much of that time when you are young, you will reap the rewards of that study for the many years remaining in your life.  If you wait until you are seventy to begin your study, most of your life will have been spent without that important understanding and the related spiritual influence.  This will change the value of your life to yourself and to those you have influence over.  So by investing a significant portion of the time early in our lives, we get the compounding effect of holding the investment in knowledge and spirit over a longer period of time, allowing its influence to permeate more of our life.  In addition, study of the scriptures is a high yield investment, meaning it has a high eternal rate of return.  It compounds at say 10 percent rather than reading something like a useful textbook, which may compound at a spiritual rate of say 7 percent.  If you think back to our example of compounding of interest, the resulting difference in asset accumulation given an original investment of $1000 over 45 years would be $21,000 at 7 percent verses $73,000 at 10 percent.  Clearly, we cannot measure the value of our eternal investment in dollars and cents, but the returns associated with different patterns of eternal investment can be very significant over a lifetime.</p>
<p>The idea of starting early fits in with the concept of learning and growing in the gospel &quot;line upon line.&quot;  The Lord does not give us everything at once.  ItÂ’s like going to college.  Many classes have prerequisites; you must take classes in a certain order because to understand an upper division calculus class you must first have an understanding of algebra.  Line upon line is the same.  We cannot expect to understand the temple endowment until we understand the fundamentals of the gospel and are subject to the influence of the Holy Ghost.  Therefore, the sooner we get started the further we can progress.  Perhaps this is one reason the Lord sends His missionaries when they are young, so they can enjoy the benefit of what one learns as a missionary throughout a lifetime.</p>
<p>When we are investing into our eternal portfolio we are investing our words, our thoughts, and our actions; in simple terms we are investing our mortal lives.  The investment options, like in temporal investing are endless, ranging from very high quality to very poor quality.  Each moment of our lives, we are choosing an investment.  Whether we drift along or plan well, we still invest every moment into something.  It may be personal scripture study or it may be MTV.  We choose to invest wisely or we choose to invest in losers. We may squander the moment with thoughts, words, or deeds that move us away from God.   </p>
<p>In temporal investing it is generally understood that diversification of investments improves the overall quality of the return relative to the risk.   This is the concept that says not to put all your eggs in one basket.  The actual asset allocation we choose depends on the investment objectives that we have.  For example, young people investing for retirement might be willing to accept a higher level of volatility and risk with an expected higher rate of return.  As you approach retirement you may wish, at an appropriate time, to move to a more conservative mix that increases the stability of your portfolio.  This concept of diversification and asset allocation can also be applied to our eternal investment.</p>
<p>To become a celestial being we must diversify our lives and ourselves.  We must exercise our agency and our judgment in a way that brings about much good in our lives and the lives of others.  We must set priorities and ensure that we are covering the main points.  Those priorities will shift at different points in our lives.  There are a number of broad objectives that should be high on our lists including:</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Working out our own salvation which is a very general overall goal</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Providing for the spiritual and temporal welfare of our families (&quot;No success can compensate for failure in the home&quot;)</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Making and keeping temple covenants</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Getting to know God and His will through studying the scriptures and other writings of His servants</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Being obedient to the laws and commandments that we have been taught as we study</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Sharing the gospel</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Redeeming the dead</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Prayer</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Fulfilling church assignments</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Serving others</p>
<p>The actual things we put on our list of current goals might vary over time.  For example, as a young student who is also a parent, your goals might include the following:</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Complete an education</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Work a job to avoid debt</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Spend time with the family</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Teach children spiritually and temporally</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Spend some special time with your spouse each week</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Accept and fulfill church assignments</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Go to the temple regularly</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Find a little time for R&amp;R</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Get some exercise</p>
<p>If you were retired, your to-do list might include:</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Spend two days each week working at the temple</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Spend MondayÂ’s doing genealogy</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Spend some time spoiling the grand kids</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Accept and fulfill church assignments</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Get some exercise</p>
<p>Â· &#9;Find time for R&amp;R</p>
<p>Can we see that for a young married priesthood holder to spend three or four days a week at the temple, thus jeopardizing his education, his job and his family, would be a poor investment?  While the temple is important to spiritual growth, it cannot be pursued at the exclusion of other important obligations, and should receive different weight at different points in our life.  </p>
<p>In the investment world, the statement is often made that timing is everything.  There are times when it might be best to over weight your investment in tech growth stocks, such as the last few years of the 1990s.  A couple of years ago, those who moved to long-term bonds did well.  That is the same with eternal investing.  As pointed out in Ecclesiastes chapter 3, there are times in our lives when we should focus on different things.  We change the target allocation.  </p>
<p>The examples I have given so far are between various good options.  In the investment world, there are frauds, deceivers, and shysters who would be happy to steal your investment capital.  This is also the case in your spiritual investments.  The great deceiver strives to rob you as pointed out in Moses 4:4.  </p>
<p>And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.</p>
<p>He robs us of our lives in two ways.  One is to entice us toward investing our lives into wickedness, which results in real losses.  The second is to get us to twitter away our time here on earth, essentially investing in zero return assets.  This is like burying your talent.</p>
<p>Wickedness is all around us.  It is available on videos or DVDs for rent; it can be found on the Internet in your home or apartment.  Dealers sell it in plastic bags on the streets; it is found in bottles in the stores.  Wickedness is promoted in schools and in the communities of the world.  It is easy to find, it is easy to become ensnared, all we must do is let it wash over us.  </p>
<p>Over the years I have received many calls from stockbrokers trying to sell me some hot stock.  Perhaps some were good and perhaps some were frauds.  They do not want to sell me the investment because it is going to improve my lot in life; they promote the investment to improve their own lot.</p>
<p>Satan does not try to get you involved in vice to make you happy, he does it because misery loves company.  An investment into his wares not only robs us of precious time, it ruins our ability to see the good opportunities.  It ruins our ability to analyze and identify the pearls of great price. We reach a point like Laman and Lemuel as described in 1 Nephi 17:45 where it states: </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God.  Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words;  .  .  .</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As GodÂ’s children spend time in pursuit of that which is low and prurient, they desensitize themselves to the influence of the spirit and may eventually lose the light of Christ, which is given to all men.  At that point, they lose their attraction to that which is good and valuable, and eventually become a hollow shell that feels no happiness or joy.  They even lose the ability to feel the pleasure that Satan enticed them with.  This is the fate of those who invest in drugs, pornography, stealing, immorality and other forms of wickedness.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">You will recall that in temporal investing, to increase the rate of return, we must be willing to increase in the level of risk taken.  This is one instance where temporal investing differs from eternal investing.  Temporal investors often lament the fact that they donÂ’t have a crystal ball that tells them where the market is going so they can avoid the losers and find the winners.  In eternal investing, the Lord had given us the scriptures, a road map that clearly defines the path we can take. We are told where the traps are that have be set to ensnare us.  There is no need for us to suffer the consequences of poor choices because we can learn how to avoid them.  Part of that path includes the expectation that we will &quot;tune into the spirit,&quot; which can help us interpret and understand the road map.  The more we become familiar with the gospel and the more attuned we become to the spirit, the greater the potential rate of return on our eternal investment with a corresponding decrease in the risk we take.  The path is clearly marked.  </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Another thing to consider is that following the Lord gives us, in many ways, more time to do the things that can really bring joy into our lives.  If you think about it, the commandments are divided into two major groups, those that tell us what to avoid and those that tell us what to embrace.  For example, some of the Ten Commandments fit into the first group and as a result take little or no investment of our time.  How much time does it take not to kill, or not to steal, or not to bear false witness?  Or how much time does it take not to covet or not commit adultery.  We also save time not worshipping the false Gods of money, materialism, or vice.  Now it does take some investment to honor our parents and to keep the Sabbath day holy.  But the reality is that the Lord has given us great latitude, within the principles of the gospel, to choose how we invest most our lives.  As I have reviewed recent talks given at devotionals, I see that many of the major gospel topics have been discussed including:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The temple</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Charity</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Standing in holy places</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Obedience</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Humility</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Obtaining spiritual knowledge</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Prayer and many others</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Each of these represents a valuable investment opportunity.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">You are all very familiar with the saving principles and ordinances of the gospel, and I hope each of you have testimonies of that doctrine which encompass the straight and narrow way to heaven.  They represent those things that we must do and those attributes that we must acquire to gain eternal life.  Once we have invested in those things, what else can or should we do?  How do we weave these principles and ordinances into lives that are spent working, socializing, rearing our families, and dealing with a wide range of lifeÂ’s experiences?  </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The principle of moderation is similar to the temporal investment concept of diversification. Diversification and moderation allow and encourage us to have many diverse experiences and interests in our lives.  For example, wholesome recreation, family vacations, and other activities are certainly supported by the gospel plan.  You will note that here at BYU-Idaho we encourage your participation in very broad and comprehensive activity and service offerings.  These are all healthful opportunities to develop your minds, bodies, and attitudes in very positive ways.  Much of our lives should be spent doing things that we are not specifically compelled to do within the framework of correct principles.  </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As I have lived my life, I have frequently had discussions that make it clear that some members of the Church see the gospel as a cross to bear, rather than the good news.  They may have feelings of inadequacy because they feel they should be doing something else or something more.  I am not talking about those involved in serious sin but, by way of example, those young mothers who while caring for a young family feel guilt because they do not make it to the temple every week, or the young man who has 15 credits and a job but has not done all of his genealogy.  A wise man once said that we should not feel guilty while sitting in the temple that we are not home doing our genealogy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Others may see the gospel as a bunch of rules that they feel limit their right to choose.  They see the gospel as a checklist of does and donÂ’t, much like what the Pharisees of the New Testament promoted.  They do not see that the gospel is really the good news.  They fail to see the gospel as a guide to happiness that leads us around the many snares intended to destroy us.  In essence they really do not understand and accept the power of the atonement.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There are many good things that we can be doing in life. They include such things as taking young children to the zoo, or going out on a date, or going to a ward social, or doing your homework.  Each of us has the opportunity of choosing how to use each moment of our lives.  Frankly, some do it better than others.  If you find yourself spending excessive amounts of time in front of a tube watching TV, chatting on the computer, playing video games, or surfing the net, I would suggest that you are investing in low to negative return assets.  Much that is available in those mediums will rob you of growth in your spiritual portfolio.  Consider instead, signing up for an outdoor experience with the activity program here at BYU-Idaho.  This will give you an opportunity for exposure to many different experiences like hiking, climbing, canoeing, golf, tennis, or skiing.  Or perhaps you would enjoy being involved in competitive basketball or softball, or one of the other team sports as a player, or coach, or officiator.  Participation in the many cultural offerings can also diversify your experience and increase your appreciation of the beauty of the arts.  In addition, there are many service opportunities organized by and for students.  These kinds of experiences can provide a foundation for healthful activity throughout your life, and provide a basis for family activities as you raise your own children.<font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000"> </font>
<font face="Times New Roman"> You know well the scripture in Doctrine and Covenants 58:27 which says: </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I believe the Lord is clearly saying we should live life and not just be observers.  There are many good causes to engage in.  We understand that it is difficult to have good spiritual health without having good physical, emotional, and mental health.  We should keep this in mind as we select from the many options to diversify our investment into our eternal lives as we follow the straight and narrow way.  We need to be mentally active, physically active, socially active, and spiritually active.  We need to have positive interactions with others.  We need to have wholesome laughter in our homes. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">You will recall that when Adam was cast out of the garden he was told that by the sweat of his face he would eat bread.  Our bodies were designed with the expectation that we would be giving them a physical workout once in a while.  In diversifying your portfolio, be sure to include some time for physical activity and consider the fact that the super-sized drink alone that some of you have with your super-sized meal, has more calories than you should have for the whole meal.  </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">To keep myself active, I have enjoyed trekking in the mountains over the years, often with my family.  
<font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000">(Photo 1)</font><font face="Times New Roman"> Knowing that I am going to do this, I usually do some running so that I can enjoy the activity without feeling like IÂ’m going to have a heart attack.  </font>
<font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000">(Photo 2)</font><font face="Times New Roman"> I take my camera and take pictures.  I find such trips help me to maintain my physical, spiritual, and emotional health.  </font>
<font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000">(Photo 3)</font><font face="Times New Roman"> There is something awesome about walking through the natural creations of God.  On one such Saturday outing in June, I encountered two young ladies who were BYU-Idaho students.  As I recall, one was from Idaho Falls and the other from Utah.  I was pleased to see them there, to know that they were experiencing the beauty of nature and not just "vegging" out in their apartments.  As part of our investment, each of us should select healthy activities and hobbies to participate in.  They become positive tools that we can use in rearing our families.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I have it on good authority that President Bednar has been known to run stadium stairs and that he and Sister Bednar have been seen skiing the slopes at Grand Targhee.  I also know that he is a busy man not only as he serves as president here at BYU-Idaho but in his ecclesiastical calling as a member of the seventy.  He also clearly has an unusual grasp of the scriptures.  It is apparent that he is anxiously engaged; he is investing his life well, including time to exercise and revitalize himself.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">President Hinckley is a great example of investing in his eternal life.  After a long life of dedication to family, service, and gospel principles, at age 93 he continues to live his life at a pace not equaled by many people half his age.  He was not always a prophet.  At some point in time he was a young student like you, making the same decisions as you about how to invest his life.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Each of you gets to choose how you apply the principles of the gospel in your own lives.  I hope what you have heard today is that the gospel is not a checklist of the things we can and canÂ’t do.  Life should be a wonderful adventure, where we share positive growing experiences with our brothers and sisters.  Being anxiously engaged is not a trial of life; it is the fuel of life.  Each moment of our lives can be something special, a time to learn, or share, or pray.  Sometimes it should be a time for relaxation, particularly after long periods of work, learning, activity, and service . . . but donÂ’t let your life slip away without fully experiencing it.  Get involved, be diversified, invest each moment in something positive, and be joyful. Start now so that the &quot;line upon line&quot; process can begin.   As stated by Moroni in Mormon 9:28:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Be wise in the days of your probation; strip yourselves of all uncleanness; ask not, that ye may consume it on your lusts, but ask with a firmness unshaken, that ye will yield not to temptation, but that ye will serve the true and living God.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I know God lives and that he loves us, I know His son is the Great Redeemer, and I know the Holy Ghost can help us direct our lives.  They are all real.  We have a Prophet who knows and shares the will of the Father.  Like the servants who received the talents, we know what our father expects of us.  We have made covenants with Him.  Now let us go forward and invest our lives according to His will that we might &quot;enter into the joy of the Lord.&quot;  I so pray in the name of Jesus Christ, 
amen</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Times">I
always enjoy coming to Rexburg and feeling the spirit of this campus. A grand
experiment was launched here not long ago. You are participants in a visionary enterprise
that is truly marvelous. BYUÂ–Idaho is destined to establish trend setting
standards and expectations in higher education. I am confident you will
succeed, even beyond your highest expectations and aspirations. It is truly an
honor to be with you on this occasion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Times">My
roots are in Idaho. I was born in Twin Falls and received an education in the
schools of Burley. Living on a farm provided time and space for discovery and
reflection. It was there that I discovered the beauty and power of music. Working
alone in the fields, I could sing and whistle familiar songs and create songs
of my own. By trying to write a few of these songs, I learned by experience to
appreciate the vast knowledge and skill required. The process of songwriting
fascinated me. About a year before entering college I made a quiet decision to
become a musician.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Times">Creating
songs and other forms of music has been a great source of joy. Some of my
creative work has been personal and developmental, but most has been intended
to bless others. Always, the experience has been the same. During the creative
process I learn things that are precious, sometimes surprising; things that
could be learned in no other way. When these creative works are performed I
learn once again, and always marvel that the creative process requires
performance before it is complete. Of greater significance, however, is the way
creative work has helped me learn to hear, to read, to ponder, and to
understand the scriptures and other valid sources of spiritual enlightenment.
Let me explain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Times">Meaningful,
lasting songs are created when a composerÂ’s thoughts and feelings are
connected. Without this connection there is no music, only organized sound.
Learning from the scriptures and the teachings of contemporary prophets, seers,
and revelators requires the same connection of thought and feeling. Indeed, the
Lord imparts his Spirit to us in order to enlighten our mind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">and</i> fill our soul with joy (Doctrine and
Covenants 11:13).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>He communicates with
us through thought <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">and</i> feeling. I
have learned that the most productive creative process is parallel to the
process of learning under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Conversely, the
most meaningful scriptural study may often be very similar to the creative
process. In both processes, thought and feeling must be connected if our
understanding is to expand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Times">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Times"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â </span>To learn more about this common process,
letÂ’s consider <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">the songs we sing</i> and
their relationship to our spiritual journey. I use the word Â“songÂ” in the
broadest sense because we have differing musical understanding and taste. In
its deepest sense, however, a song is a stirring within the soul that demands
expression. We vocalize some of these stirrings, while others are expressed
more quietly. I believe James Montgomery captured the similarity between a
prayer and a song in his hymn <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Prayer Is
the SoulÂ’s Sincere Desire</i>. To illustrate, allow me to slightly alter his
words:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan lines-together;
page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:Times">Â“<i>[Song] is the
soulÂ’s sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed, the motion of a hidden fire that
trembles in the breast. [Song] is the burden of a sigh, the falling of a tear,
the upward glancing of an eye when none but God is near. [Song] is the simplest
form of speech that infant lips can try; [song], the sublimest strains that
reach the Majesty on high</i>Â” (Hymns, #145).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Times">In
this context, we may better understand what our Savior meant when He told Emma
Smith that His Â“<i>soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of
the righteous is a prayer unto me</i>Â” (Doctrine and Covenants 25:12).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Times">Some
songs are motivational and encourage us to act. Others are born of reflection
and help us learn from the past. Perhaps the most engaging songs look toward
the future and invite us to anticipate growth and change. Songs can also be
either the result or cause of right or wrong behavior. In my experience,
righteous behavior invites songs of joy, and songs of joy and happiness
encourage righteous behavior. Unrighteous behavior leads to songs of misery,
and songs of misery and rebelliousness encourage unrighteous behavior. It may
be true that we <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sing about who we are</i>
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">and become what we sing about.</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

us better understand and remember these five attributes. Hold your right hand
in front of you at about eye level with the palm forward. The U&#8209;shaped
space between the thumb and first finger reminds us of the first letter of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">unity</i> and the importance of being <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">unselfish.</b> The first finger corresponds
with the second letter of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">unity</i> and
reminds us to be <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">noble</b>. The second
finger reminds us of the third letter of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">unity</i>

The third finger corresponds with the fourth letter of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

And the little finger reminds us of the fifth letter of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

with the first finger of your left hand at either your thumb or the finger that
matches the first letter of each: <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">U</b>nselfish

the angels (See <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">DNTC</i> 3:134). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the chapter heading for chapter 2, we learn that Jesus
came to this earth to suffer death in order to bring salvation to all mankind;
that He came to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I would now like to focus our attention on Hebrews chapter
3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>LetÂ’s look at verses 1-6.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>In verse 1 we read that Christ is to be
considered as the Apostle and High Priest of our profession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>You see that in the chapter heading as
well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Another word for Â“professionÂ”
could be the faith we profess; or the gospel, or the church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>So, we could read verse 1 this way: Â“<i>Wherefore,
holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider Jesus Christ, the
Apostle and High Priest of our [faith, or of our gospel or of our church]</i>Â”
(Hebrews 3:1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In verses 2-5, Paul writes about Moses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Paul knew that the Jews had a high opinion
of the faithfulness of Moses, yet he wanted them to know that MosesÂ’
faithfulness was but a type of ChristÂ’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>In verses 5 and 6 we read, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>And Moses verily was faithful <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">in</b> all his house, as a servant, for a
testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; But Christ as a son <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">over</b> his own house; whose house are we,
if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end</i>
(Hebrews 3: 5-6, emphasis added). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do you see the point Paul is making?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Moses was a faithful servant <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">in</i>
</b>his house, but Christ, as the Son of God, is the rightful Owner, the Master
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">over</i>
</b>His house, His church, His peopleÂ—our Savior, and our Healer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Also, you see a very important word in verse
6, the word Â“if.Â”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Here Paul teaches
that <u>if</u> you want to be a part of ChristÂ’s house, or His church, or his
people, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">you must hold fast the confidence</i></b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please keep verse 6 and that Â“confidenceÂ” in mind as I now
share a personal experience as an analogy for understanding our complete
dependence on the Savior and the extreme importance of Â“holding fastÂ” to Him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You need to know that I am quite fearful of heights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Standing on anything higher than six feet
from the ground, I begin to feel very uncomfortable.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">Â  </span>Being so afraid of heights, several years ago I did something that
I never thought I could do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Some
experienced mountain climbing friends of mine invited my two youngest sons and
me to go with them on a hike down the Pine Creek Trail in Zion National Park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>This hike takes you through a magnificent,
deep, narrow, twisting, slot canyon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>The thing that makes this particular hike so exciting (for those who are
not afraid of heights, I might add) is the seven required repels as you descend
this slot canyon. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Repelling is the technique used to descend from something by
rope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>The equipment consists of special
climbing ropes, gloves, straps, anchors, a harness that goes around your waist
and hips and a carabineer which is an oblong metal ring that the rope passes
through to help control the speed of your descent.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">Â  </span>Repelling requires a sense of adventure, some skill and some
physical strength and is <u>definitely not</u> for those who are terrified of
heights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>In spite of my fear of high
places, and after a lot of persuasion from my friends, I reluctantly decided to
make this hike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>The most compelling
reason for doing something this scary was knowing that my boys would love it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well, off we went and after a little practice with our
equipment and some fairly easy repels, which I am pleased to say I handled
quite well, we found ourselves at the end of the slot canyon with one more
rappel to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>This last rappel was the
biggest one of all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>It was a 125-foot
free fall down through a dark cavern into a shallow pool of water!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>A free fall rappel means being suspended on
the rope free of any other kind of support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>I cannot describe how frightened I was as I looked over the edge of the
cliff into the darkness and saw how far it was down to the bottom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I watched as some of the members of our group confidently
secured themselves to the rope, leaned back over the edge of the cliff, and
with great excitement began their descent to the ground below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>All the way down they would shout back up to
us telling how fun and thrilling it was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>Finally, it was my turn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>I
carefully made my way to the edge of the cliff.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">Â  </span>Realizing my two boys were watching, I wanted to portray an image
of strength and control, not that of a quivering wimp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Notwithstanding my best efforts, I am sure
they could see that I was truly scared to death.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Terrified, I held firmly onto the rope and slowly backed up
to the edge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Trying not to look down, I
took a deep breath and leaned back into my harness and began to inch my way
over the cliff into the great, dark abyss that extended 125 feet below me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>After a few steps over the edge, it opened
up into a large cavern.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>No longer would
I be able to provide any support with my feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>I now had to Â“free fall.Â”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>At
that moment, I fought with images in my mind of the rope breaking and falling
to a certain death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Shaking and hoping
that the rope would support me, I took another deep breath and carefully let
more rope pass through my carabineer until I was hanging there in mid air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>As I firmly held the rope I could literally
feel its strength.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>It was then that I
looked up and I could see that the rope was still connected securely to the
anchor in the rock above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>The rope
safely held me and instantly I felt confident that I would be all right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>At that moment a wonderful, reassuring
feeling of excitement swept over me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>My
rappel to the ground below was one of the most exhilarating experiences of my
life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now let me try and relate Hebrews chapter 3, verse 6 to the
story I just shared and make a few comments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>We worship our Heavenly Father as the almighty ruler of heaven and earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>He is literally our Father in Heaven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>We lived with Him as spirits before we were
born.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>We are His children and belong to
His eternal family (See Hebrews 12:9).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>He loves us and wants us to achieve true, eternal happiness (See Romans
8: 16-17).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>To enable us to become like
Him, our Father in Heaven prepared a plan that allows us to come to earth and
receive a physical body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>This life is a
time of testing to see if we will be obedient to all things whatsoever the Lord
our God commands us and to see if we will choose liberty and eternal life or
choose captivity and death (See Abraham 3:25; 2 Nephi 2:27).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Having no memory of our pre-mortal life, we
must act by faith (See 2 Corinthians 5:6-7).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>He gives us commandments, ordinances, and covenants to point the way we
should go to fulfill our eternal potential (See Moses 5:58-59).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>We will be held accountable for our
decisions and actions (See Doctrine and Covenants 101:78).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>We experience trials, temptations, and
sin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>By divine design, there must be an
opposition in all things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>The trials
and temptations here in mortality are constant and at times very intense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>The sins we commit here make us unworthy to
dwell in the presence of our Heavenly Father (See 1 Nephi 15:34).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May I suggest that in order to help us with these trials and
temptations and receive help and forgiveness for our sins, Heavenly Father
provided a Â“ropeÂ” securely anchored to a Â“Rock.Â”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">Â  </span>The Â“Rock,Â” to which the Â“ropeÂ” is anchored, is our Savior Jesus
Christ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>The Â“ropeÂ” provided for us is
the SaviorÂ’s Atonement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Because of the
love Heavenly Father has for his children, He sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to
redeem us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Jesus fulfilled the will of
the Father and voluntarily suffered, which suffering caused Him to tremble
because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit
and give His life to pay for our sins (See Doctrine and Covenants 19:18).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>The Â“Rock,Â” our Savior Jesus Christ, is firm
and steadfast; He is pure and righteous, filled with eternal love, having suffered
for all, that we might not suffer if we would repent (See Doctrine and
Covenants 19:16).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>The Â“rope,Â” the
Atonement of Jesus Christ, is infinite in its effects to strengthen, comfort,
support, sustain, and save.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As Paul taught in verse 6 of Hebrews chapter 3, we must hold
fast in the confidence and rejoicing of the hope, in Jesus Christ and his
Atonement, firm unto the end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â Â  </span>The
words Â“hold fastÂ” are not words we would normally use today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Instead, we would say, Â“Hold on tight
to,Â”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Â“Keep a firm grip on,Â” or Â“DonÂ’t
let go of.Â”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>If we hold on tight, keep a
firm grip on and donÂ’t let go of the confidence, the rejoicing and the hope, in
the Redeemer of the world, firm unto the end, we will be a part of His house worthy
of his grace and mercy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Alma taught
that same principle, Â“<i>Whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be
supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall
be lifted up at the last day</i>Â” (Alma 36:3). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you find yourself looking down over a frightening cliff of
sin, sorrow, suffering, regret, discouragement, disease, fear, failure,
loneliness, or loss, get a firm grip on that Â“rope,Â” even though you may be
afraid or even doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>If you will not
let go, I promise youÂ’ll begin to feel of its strength and power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>As you look up you will see that the Â“ropeÂ”
you are holding is securely anchored to the Â“RockÂ” above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>The Â“RockÂ” and the Â“ropeÂ” will safely hold
you and strengthen, comfort, and support you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>You will feel greater confidence that you will be all right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Your fears will be replaced with reassuring
feelings of confidence and rejoicing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>This will give you greater hope to go further even unto the end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Nephi taught this principle in 2 Nephi
chapter 4 where he wrote, </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In my association with some dear friends, I saw how we can
be supported by the SaviorÂ’s Atonement through difficult times in our lives as
we Â“hold fast the confidenceÂ” in Him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>I
first met Bishop Mervin and Dorothy Prince of New Harmony, Utah, when I was
called as stake president of the Cedar City University 3<sup>rd</sup> Stake in
March of 1999.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>They were both healthy,
energetic members of the Church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Bishop
Prince was the bishop of one of the young single adult wards in our stake, and
Sister Prince was our stake librarian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>I came to know and love them deeply, and I learned some of lifeÂ’s most
important lessons from their example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>Their experience gives convincing evidence of how the Savior reaches out
to us in our time of trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>I realize
that their story of faith and courage is like many others who have also
sufferedÂ—some of whom are attending this devotional today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>I share the PrinceÂ’s story today with their
permission.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Being the bishop of a young single adult ward requires a
considerable amount of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>In
addition to the regular church meetings on Sunday, there are many
administrative meetings and activities to attend.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">Â  </span>But what takes a great deal of time are the hours of interviewing
and counseling members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Being a bishop
of a young single adult ward is a big job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>During many of those hours of service, rarely did I ever see Bishop
Prince without Sister Prince.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>They
would drive together from New Harmony to Cedar City, about a 30-minute drive,
almost every Sunday. She would serve in the stake library, attend the block of
meetings and then wait by her husbandÂ’s office door until he was done
interviewing so they could go home together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>Many times she would do her cross-stitch while she waited and visit with
the members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>The precious time they
spent with those young people was something they both cherished.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Early in the fall of 1999, several weeks had gone by, and I
had not seen Sister Prince.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>So, I asked
Bishop Prince one Sunday afternoon where his wife was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>He said the reason why I had not seen her
was due to a terrible cold, which had turned into pneumonia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Hearing this, I asked if there was anything
I could do to help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>He said that I
should not worry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>He reassured me that
she was starting to feel a little better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>He felt she would be back to her daily routine within the upcoming
week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Fortunately, I did see Sister
Prince that next Sunday, but I could tell she still wasnÂ’t back to full
strength, and I noticed that she had developed a deep cough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>In spite of this, she seemed happy and in
good spirits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>As the weeks went by, I
saw less and less of her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>In a monthly
priesthood interview I had with Bishop Prince, I inquired again about Sister
Prince.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>He said that she still had a
bad cough that just would not go away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>He said that she had made another appointment to see her doctor. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Several weeks after that interview, I received a telephone
call one evening at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>It was Bishop
Prince.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>He said, Â“IÂ’m calling to tell
you that Dorothy visited the doctor to see if he could help her with the cough
she had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>He ordered an x-ray of her
lungs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>When he examined the x-ray, he
noticed some spots there and referred her to another doctor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>More tests were done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>She was then referred to a cancer specialist
and he has discovered that Dorothy is full of cancer.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">Â  </span>She has been told that she only has four to six months to
live.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>She is wondering if you would
give her a blessing.Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The blessing was given but with no promise of healing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Then came the brutal treatments of
chemotherapy with one gloomy prognosis after another and little help to stop
the spread of the cancer or the pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>Through it all, I witnessed from them complete submission to the Lord
without complaint or blame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>In every
conversation I had with them during this difficult time they lovingly expressed
their deep gratitude and faith in Heavenly Father and for the atonement of
Jesus Christ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>They Â“held fast to the
confidence and rejoiced in the hopeÂ” of the power of the Atonement Â“firm unto
the end.Â”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>They did not let go of the
Lord, and He did not let go of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>The Lord had promised them that Â“even to your old age I am he; and even
to [gray] hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will
carry, and I will deliver youÂ” (Isaiah 46:4).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>He supported them and filled them with hope, lightened their load, and
calmed their troubled hearts. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â </span>With that
support, on a beautiful spring day surrounded by her loved ones, Sister Dorothy
Prince quietly and peacefully was delivered from her pain and suffering and
passed from mortality to the world of spirits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>Bishop Prince confidently and patiently now waits for the day when they
will be united together again forever.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Consider these statements by the Lord: In the Doctrine and

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am grateful for the opportunity to work at BYUÂ–Idaho.Â 
IÂ’ve been here for 30 years and have never wanted to work at any other place.Â 
IÂ’m also grateful for the opportunity to share some thoughts from the
scriptures with you.Â  IÂ’ve always appreciated the scriptures because it was
through them that I have been able to learn about and come to love Jesus
Christ.Â  In addition, it is always comforting to me to read of others who have
weaknesses similar to mine, but whom God has blessed and helped to overcome
those weaknesses.Â  Studying their experiences can help us avoid some of the
challenges they faced.Â  One such person that I have studied about recently is Lot
who lived in the city of Sodom. You will remember that Lot was a faithful man
who put his trust in the Lord and his uncle Abraham.Â  Lot followed Abraham to
the land of Canaan where he shared in the blessings the Lord poured out upon
Abraham. Â After many years, Abraham and Lot had prospered so much that they
decided to part ways because there was not room enough for both of them.Â 
Abraham gave Lot his choice of where to settle and Lot chose the fertile plains
near the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.Â  Although they parted ways there was
still love between Abraham and Lot and later, when Lot was taken captive,
Abraham sent his men to rescue him.Â  Through the years LotÂ’s family fell away
from the truth. The people became so wicked that the Lord decided he must
destroy the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.Â  Because Lot was still righteous and
loved by Abraham, the Lord sent angels to warn him and his family to leave the
city before it was destroyed.Â  Lot tried to warn his married children to heed
the message of the angels and leave the city, but they refused. We can pick up
the account in Genesis chapter 19 verse 15:Â Â Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>And when the morning arose, then the
angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two
daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.Â 
And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of
his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto
him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.&nbsp; And it came to pass, when they had
brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; <u>look not
behind thee</u>, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,
lest thou be consumed.Â  And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:Â  Behold
now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy
mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to
the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:Â  Behold now, this city [is]
near to flee unto, and it [is] a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, ([is]
it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.Â  And he said unto him, See, I
have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this
city, for the which thou hast spoken.Â  Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot
do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was
called Zoar.Â  The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered
into Zoar.Â  Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah
brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;Â  And he overthrew those cities,
and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew
upon the ground.Â  <u>Â But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became
a pillar of salt</u> </i>(Genisis 19: 15-26, emphasis added). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here are some of the things that strike me about that
account.Â  First, the Lord truly loved Lot to the point that heÂ  removed him
forcefully out of harms way.Â  Second, it is interesting that even as the angels
are trying to save him, he is arguing that he doesnÂ’t want to go to the
mountains for fear that harm will come to him, Third, if an angel or any
representative of the Lord tells us to do something, we should do it
immediately.Â  IÂ’ve always wondered what caused LotÂ’s wife to look back, which
resulted in her being turned into a pillar of salt.Â  I wonder how long it was
before Lot discovered that his wife wasnÂ’t with him.Â  Finally, I am fascinated
with the message to not look back.Â  I would like to spend some time today
examining some of the things we learn from this account.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, I would like to discuss how we should react when the
LordÂ’s representatives give us a message.Â  One of my favorite hymns is Â“How
Great the Wisdom and the LoveÂ”.Â  The third verse goes as follows:Â  Â“By strict
obedience, Jesus won, the prize with glory rife.Â  Thy will oh God, not mine be
done, adorned his mortal life.Â”Â  I believe that one of the challenges we have
today is learning the meaning of strict obedience.Â  In Alma 35: 15 we read that
  Alma was grieved because of the wickedness of the people who were Â“Â…offended
because of the strictness of the word,Â…Â”Â  Later, Helaman speaking of humanity
in general, foretold conditions which exist in our time this way.Â  (Helaman
12:4)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>O how foolish, and how vain, and how
evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are
the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one,
and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!Â  Yea, how quick to
be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which
is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give
ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom's paths</i> (Helaman 12:
4-5)!Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All around us we see signs that our society is Â“offended
because of the strictness of the wordÂ” and Â“is quick to do iniquity and slow to
do good.Â” The attitude of strict obedience has been replaced with one of Â“moral
relativityÂ” and casual obedience. As a result the world does not believe there
are such things as eternal truths or principles.Â  Hence, there are no laws to
which all people must answer.Â Â  Most of the world does not believe that God has
decreed that we should maintain moral cleanliness for example.Â  Rather it
advocates that what was previously called sin is okay if those involved feel
that it is okay.Â Â  The idea that we should strictly follow a moral code
dictated by God is considered outdated or quaint or repressive.Â  Even within
the church too often those who are strict in their obedience to gospel
principles are ridiculed or, at best, tolerated.Â  In our society the word
strict has a negative connotation and few of us want to be strict about
anything, and yet, historically, God has required strict obedience of his
people.Â  In addition to the incident with LotÂ’s wife, I would like to share two
other Old Testament examples.Â  In the book of 1 Samuel chapter 15 we read that
King Saul was commanded to take his army and destroy the Amalekites.Â  The
commandment required total destruction including all the people and animals so
that there was not to be any living thing left. Saul took his men and carried
out most of what he was commanded to do but he spared the life of the king and
he took the best animals as spoils of war.Â  When the prophet Samuel came to the
battle scene to check on Saul he found that Saul and his men were offering
sacrifices of the animals they had captured from their enemies.Â  When
challenged by Samuel, Saul defended himself saying we killed all the people and
now we are offering sacrifice to the Lord.Â  What could be wrong with that?Â 
SamuelÂ’s response should be a warning to all those who would insert their own
will into the commandments of God.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>And Samuel said, Hath the LORD [as
great] delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of
the LORD? Behold, to obey [is] better than sacrifice, [and] to hearken than the
fat of rams.Â Â  For rebellion [is as] the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness
[is as] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD,
he hath also rejected thee from [being] king</i> (1 Samuel 15: 22-23).Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From that time forward, King SaulÂ’s life was a steady
decline.Â  A second example brings home the need of strict obedience even
stronger.Â  One of the strict rules in the house of Israel was that only the
Levites were to touch the sacred Ark of the Covenant.Â  Shortly after David was
made king he determined to move the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.Â  One of
the men assigned to help move the Ark was a man names Uzzah.Â  In 2 Samuel
chapter 6 we read this account.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>And they brought it (the ark) out of
the house of Abinadab which [was] at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and
Ahio went before the ark.Â  And David and all the house of Israel
played before the LORD on all manner of [instruments made of] fir wood, even on
harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.Â  And
when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth [his hand] to the
ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook [it].Â  And the anger of the
LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for [his] error; and
there he died by the ark of God</i> (2 Samuel 6: 4-7).Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While the punishment for touching the Ark seems excessive to
us, we need to remember the time in which it took place, but we should also be
reminded that God requires not casual, but strict obedience.Â  In modern times
Joseph Smith taughtÂ  the principle of strict obedience.Â  I give three brief
examples:Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Â“<i>Live in strict obedience to the
commandments of God, and walk humbly before Him, and He will exalt thee in His
own due time</i> (HC 1: 408); <i>and , I made this my rule.: When the Lord
commands, do i</i>t (HC 2: 170); <i>and finally,Â Â  In obedience there is joy
and peace unspotted, unalloyed</i>Â” (HC5:135).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are many examples of the expectation of strictness in
obeying God in the church today. Tithing means ten percent of our increase.Â  If
we pay nine percent it is not tithing and we are listed as part tithe payers.Â 
Persons who pay less than ten percent are not allowed to have a recommend to
enter the temple. The sacrament prayers and the baptismal prayers must be said
word perfect.Â  If they are not, the person in charge is instructed to have them
said over again. You have to be a priest or an elder to bless the sacrament.Â 
Deacons donÂ’t bless babies and only patriarchs give patriarchal blessings.Â 
Students at BYU-Idaho sign a statement before they are admitted that they will
live the Honor Code and it is expected that they will strictly honor that covenant
that they have made.Â  We donÂ’t decide we will go on a mission and then simply
go and preach. We prove ourselves worthy and are called of God, by a prophet to
serve as missionaries.Â  The Lord expects us to be strictly obedient, but how
often are we like LotÂ’s wife, or Saul, or Uzzah and fail to carefully and
strictly obey the word of the Lord.Â  Lot and his family were told not to look
back.Â  That seems like such an insignificant thing and yet it cost his wife her
life.Â  Why did she look back?Â  Maybe it was the noise, or maybe she could feel
the heat from the fire and brimstone raining down from heaven, maybe she was
thinking of her children who had remained in the cities, or maybe she was just
a contrary person who wasnÂ’t going to let some man tell her what to do. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I believe that it is natural for all of us to have a little
of that tendency to disobedience.Â  If that werenÂ’t true, there would be no need
for the atonement.Â  If we are honest with ourselves, we realize that all of us
have had times in our lives when we knew what was expected of us and did
otherwise.Â  I have had that experience in my own family.Â  When our children
were small, my wife and I sometimes punished their disobedience by making them
go to their room or sit on a chair.Â  I remember one particular time when one of
my daughters who was about four or five was sent to her room for punishment.Â 
When she started her door was closed but pretty soon I heard it quietly and
slowly open.Â  It wasnÂ’t long before a little foot appeared in the doorway and
slid carefully into the hall.Â  After a few minutes part of a body began to
appear.Â  Gradually, she extended more and more of her body into the hall until
only her hand was left in the room.Â  She then asked, Â“Can I come out of my room
now?Â”Â  In her mind she was still in her room because her hand was there, but
the rest of her had escaped.Â  She had basically disobeyed the order to stay in
her room, but was going through enough of the motion of being there that she
could think that she wasnÂ’t violating what she was told.Â  Too often in life we
are like my daughter pretending to be obeying the Lord when in reality we have
left the spirit of it far behind.Â  In the account of King Saul, he attempted to
divert attention from his sin by offering sacrifices which was also a
commandment of God.Â  As church members we sometimes act in a similar manner.Â  I
have seen people come for a temple recommend, who were doing everything right
but living the word of wisdom.Â  In their minds they were worthy of a recommend
because of all the good things they were doing, but they wanted to have us
overlook the fact that they were breaking the word of wisdom.Â  Occasionally,
people who have been full tithe payers for years will expect temple recommends
even though they are not currently paying a full tithe.Â  I have seen parents
who were angry because their child was told to repent of his sins and wait an
appropriate time before he sent in his mission papers.Â  They could only see the
good things about their child and rationalized themselves into believing he was
worthy when he wasnÂ’t.Â  I remember being disappointed when talking to a couple
about renewing their temple recommends only to learn that it was more important
to them to drive a new sporty car than it was to pay their tithing so they
could be worthy to go to the temple.Â  Finally, in the spirit of Uzzah, I have
seen well meaning people reassuring friends that it is okay to sin a little, or
a lot, and not have need of going to the proper authorities to begin the
repentance process.Â  After hearing these accounts of GodÂ’s dealings with his
people, one might decide to be obedient out of fear of the consequences of sin.
While there might be some element of that in our lives, I believe that the
stronger motivation to be strictly obedient would be our love of God.Â  In John 14:15 the Savior taught:Â  Â“<i>If ye love me, keep my commandments.</i>Â”Â  The Apostle Paul
taught in his first epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 13 verse 1, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>THOUGH I speak with the tongues of
men and of angels, and have not charity (or the pure love of Christ)Â  I am
become [as] sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.Â  And though I have [the gift
of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I
have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
nothing</i> (1 Corinthians 13: 1-2). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord expects us to not only do the right thing, but to
do it for the right reason.Â Â  As our children were growing up, each of them had
duties to fulfill around our home.Â  It was a constant battle getting them to do
their jobs.Â  Many times they would only do their work if they were threatened
with serious punishment.Â  I remember talking about that in one of our home
evening lessons.Â  I told them that our home would be a happier, more beautiful
place if they did their chores not out of fear of punishment, but because they
loved the family and wanted our home to look nice. Of course it didnÂ’t work,
but I was teaching them the truth.Â  Our motivation to be strictly obedient
should be the result of our love of God, not our fear of him. I pray that we
will follow the SaviorÂ’s example and cultivate the quality of strict obedience
in our lives.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Naturally, before we can be strictly obedient to something
it is necessary to understand it.Â  LotÂ’s wife knew she was not supposed to look
back, but she may not have known why she shouldnÂ’t look back.Â  If the angels
had told her she would turn into a pillar of salt if she looked back she might
not have done it.Â  There is a difference between knowing something and understanding
it.Â  To know something deals with facts.Â  To understand goes beyond the facts
and addresses why or how something is the way it is.Â  It has been said that we
know with our heads and understand with our hearts. I have a three year old
grand daughter who can recite her ABCÂ’s.Â  Yet she does not at this point
understand that the ABCÂ’s are the foundation of all our written communication.Â 
I have a five year old grand daughter who understands enough to be able to read
words, but sometimes she pronounces words that she does not know the meaning
of. I have a thirty two year old daughter who has a masterÂ’s degree and teaches
English at BYU in Provo.Â  She has learned why and how we put letters together
to make words, and words together to make sentences, and that there are some
words that are more powerful than others.Â  Her understanding has become a
powerful tool for her.Â  Only after years of diligent study and experience will
my granddaughters gain the understanding necessary to reach the level that my
daughter has reached. Understanding the gospel is similar.Â  We do a great job
in home evenings, Sunday school, priesthood, and seminary of teaching important
things like honesty, chastity, tithing, etc.Â  In fact, I often hear people
comment on how much knowledge todayÂ’s youth have, compared to my generation at
that age.Â  I believe that despite the knowledge young people have today, there
is sometimes a disconnect when it comes to understanding those principles to
the point that they know why it is important to live them.Â  If people cannot
connect the principles by which we live our lives to the basic doctrines of the
kingdom, the principles soon become social rules which can change at the whim
of society, rather than eternal truths.Â  There is an interesting account in the
Book of Mormon that illustrates this point.Â  We all know the account of King
BenjaminÂ’s farewell address.Â  He gathered his people together and in one of the
greatest sermons ever recorded taught them important truths of the gospel.Â  The
people were so moved that they were, as they saidÂ… Â“ willing to enter into a
covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in
all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our daysÂ…Â” (Mosiah
5:5).Â  This was one of the spiritual high points of the Nephites.Â  However, we
read in Mosiah chapter 26 verse 1 that</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Â…it came to pass that there were
many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king
Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they
did not believe the tradition of their fathers.Â  They did not believe what had
been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe
concerning the coming of Christ.Â  And now because of their unbelief they could
not understand the word of God; and their hearts were hardened</i> (Mosiah 26:
1-3). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How could it be that the parents could reach one of the
spiritual highs in the history of the Nephites but their children fall away
because they were too young to understand the words of King Benjamin?Â  We might
ask how children could grow up in homes where the parents had covenanted to be
obedient in all things the rest of their lives and not come to understand the
word of God?Â  I donÂ’t know the reason why, but one canÂ’t help but wonder just
how the children were taught.Â  In his great address King Benjamin taught of our
relationship to God and to each other.Â  In addition to the specific things they
should do, he taught them the basic doctrines of the kingdom.Â  Maybe, the
parents then focused all of their energy on telling their children the things
they needed to do, but they forgot to teach them why it was important to be
honest or to not steal or not kill.Â  Too often, the experience of the Nephites
at the time of King Benjamin and King Mosiah is repeated in our times.Â 
Faithful parents prepare themselves in every way and go to the temple where
they make eternal covenants with the Lord, then as they raise their children
somehow there is a disconnect and the kids just donÂ’t get it.Â  Despite the
pleas of their parents, they like the children in the Book of Mormon example do
not believe the traditions of the parents and go astray.Â  What happens?Â  There
are a lot of elements that cause such a thing to take place, but perhaps one is
that we spend most of our time teaching our children what they should do, but
not enough time teaching them why to do it.Â  In Doctrine and Covenants 68 verse
25 we read Â“And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of
her stakes which are organized, that <u>teach them not to understand</u> the
doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of
baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when
eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.Â”Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The key word here is understand.Â  Simply teaching the way to
live is not enough.Â  It is important, even critical, but there is more involved
in understanding.Â  LotÂ’s wife was told not to look back, but apparently she
didnÂ’t understand why.Â  The why becomes an essential part of teaching our
children. Several years ago shortly before my mother died, I was talking to her
one day and said surely it makes you feel good to know that all of your
children are active in the church and have been to temple.Â  Her response
surprised me.Â  She said that she would know how good a job she had done raising
us when she saw how our children turned out.Â  It took me a few years to learn
that she was talking about the same thing I am talking to you about.Â  She
wanted to make sure that in addition to learning what to do we had also learned
why it was all important.Â  Over the last nine years I have observed hundreds of
young men receive the Melchizedek priesthood and go on missions.Â  I always
listened carefully to the testimonies of these young men as they received the
higher priesthood or left for missions.Â  I was particularly listening to hear
if they had a testimony of the living God and the atonement of Jesus Christ.Â  I
frequently heard things like, Â“I am thankful for my family or for my friends
who are always there for me.Â  Or, I know the church is true and that President
Hinckley is a prophet.Â”Â  While these things were all appropriate, to me the
telling point was if they understood their relationship to God and Jesus Christ
and had somehow personalized that knowledge.Â  During this same period of time I
have heard literally hundreds of young men and women report their missions.Â 
How gratifying it was to have almost 100% of them say they knew God lived and
they knew that Jesus Christ had died for their sins.Â  One young man left a
lasting impression on me when summarizing his mission he simply said, Â“I did it
for ChristÂ”.Â  The spirit told me that he knew why it was important to do things
like serve a mission.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is important to teach the principles and rules by which
we live.Â  My challenge to you as you raise your children is too also teach them
the basic doctrines of the church which explain why it is important to do these
things.Â  Why is a powerful word.Â  It makes parents cringe.Â  Children always
want to know why and too often as parents we canÂ’t give a good answer so we try
to divert them to something else.Â  If I could start over as a parent I would
respect my childrenÂ’s need to know why and even encourage them to ask why.Â  The
why questions are the tough ones and we need to discipline ourselves to study
things out to the point that we know why we do the things we do.Â  I was
recently reading a lesson in the Teaching of the PresidentÂ’s of the Church Â–
John Taylor which is the current course of study for the Melchizedek Priesthood
and the Relief Society.Â  At the end of the lesson it seemed that all the
questions started with why or how (which could just as easily been why).Â  I
frowned and started to turn to a different page when it occurred to me that I
was exhibiting the same behavior I was teaching against.Â  I returned to the end
of the chapter and tried to figure out the answer to those why questions.Â  I
challenge all of you as well as myself to begin studying not just what we
should do, but why we should do it so we wont find ourselves in the position of
 LotÂ’s wife when it really matters.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to return now to the story of Lot and his
wife.Â  The message ofÂ  Â… Â“look not behind theeÂ…Â” is an important one for
members of the church.Â  We read this account in the New Testament in Luke
chapter 9 starting with verseÂ  57:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>And it came to pass, that, as they
went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee
whithersoever thou goest.Â  And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds
of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.Â  And
he said unto another, Follow me.Â  But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and
bury my father.Â  Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou
and preach the kingdom of God.Â  And another also
said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which
are at home at my house.Â  And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand
to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. </i>Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As this scripture indicates, once we have given our lives to
God, He expects us to serve him diligently.Â  LotÂ’s wife was turned into a
pillar of salt because she looked back..Â  In Jeremiah we read of GodÂ’s anger at
the children of Israel for turning back to the sins of their fathers.Â 
Beginning in Chapter 11 verse 9 we read</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>And the LORD said unto me, A
conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the
inhabitants of Jerusalem.Â  They are turned back to the iniquities
of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other
gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah
have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.Â  Therefore thus saith
the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to
escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them. </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The command to not look back or turn back is significant to
all Latter-day Saints. We are expected to put sin behind us, and focus on
righteous living.Â  To turn back is to return to sin.Â  We cannot afford to do
that.Â  Looking back makes us lose our focus on the business that we must be
about.Â  Just as in the case of LotÂ’s wife, we risk losing our eternal lives if
we fail to keep the covenants that we make to the Lord.Â  Several years ago
Elder Howard W. Hunter gave this example:Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>To dig a straight furrow, the
plowman needs to keep his eyes on a fixed point ahead of him. That keeps him on
a true course. If, however, he happens to look back to see where he has been,
his chances of straying are increased. The results are crooked and irregular
furrows. Â… If our energies are focused not behind us but ahead of usÂ—on eternal
life and the joy of salvationÂ—we assuredly will obtain it.</i>Â  Ensign, May
1987, p. 16.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I was growing up, I was taught that same concept.Â 
Since I lived on a farm I had many opportunities to practice making a straight
line.Â  When I was plowing I would focus on a point and try to make a straight
furrow to that point.Â  When moving sprinkler pipe I tried focusing on one point
and making a straight line of pipe.Â  It was more difficult with the pipe
because with each pipe I had to find my target and aim toward it, then look
away when I went for the next pipe.Â  More that once I found that I had made a
straight line but to the wrong point which is worse than making a crooked line
to the right point.Â  The Lord expects us to commit ourselves totally to him and
live our lives in accordance with his will.Â  As I consider the idea that we
shouldnÂ’t look back it occurs to me that whether or not we look back depends on
what our starting point is.Â  When I was making a furrow it was important that I
not look back but remain focused on my goal.Â  However when I was moving
sprinkler pipe I learned that looking back and then looking forward helped me
keep aimed in the right direction. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â If we have been raised by faithful parents who taught us to
follow Christ, we can find strength in our times of trial by turning back to
those strong roots from our youth.Â  However, if by the time we are adults, we
have not developed our own understanding of who we are and our relationship to
God and Christ, there will inevitably come a time when what we gained from our
parents will not be enough, hence we need to set our own focus on Christ and
study and grow until our understanding of the atonement permeates our whole
being. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In closing I would like to summarize what I have tried to
convey today.Â  First, we must be strictly obedient to the teaching of the
savior through his messengers, both ancient and modern.Â  Second, we must learn
why we do what we do.Â  One of the greatest tools parents have as they teach
their children Â‘whyÂ’ is to bear their testimonies of the basic doctrines of the
church.Â  If children hear their parentsÂ’ testimonies, it gives the Holy Ghost
the opportunity to confirm the truthfulness of that testimony and paves the way
for the children to understand. Third, donÂ’t turn back.Â  Once you have
committed yourself to Jesus Christ donÂ’t turn back to the sins of your earlier
life.Â  One of the greatest blessing of the atonement is that if we repent of
our sins, that is totally turn from them, the Lord will remember them no more.Â 
If we focus on giving our lives in the service of God, there is no need to
dwell on sins for which we have repented. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once again, I am grateful for the opportunity to share these
thoughts with you today.Â  I pray that they will make a difference in your
lives.Â  I bear you my witness that God lives and knows and loves each of us;
and that we are his children. Jesus Christ did atone for our sins and made it
possible for us to return to the presence of God and have eternal increase.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">President Bednar, distinguished members of the faculty, honored guests, and graduates of 2003, I
am pleased to be with you on this memorable August morning.  I pray for the inspiration of
Heaven to attend me and to inspire my remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Graduates, I commend you for paying the price in time, in effort, in money to obtain your
education.  Parents, I honor you for choosing to sacrifice, to skimp, to go without so that your
precious son or daughter maybe given the skills which education provides to meet the many
challenges of a changing world.  Teachers, I pay tribute to you.  Not only have you guided the
eager minds of your students into paths of learning, but you have also lighted their lives,
fashioned their futures, designed their destinies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Tomorrow, graduates, a new journey begins for you.  Some of you may plan to pursue further
education and advanced degrees.  Others will enter the halls of business, the shops of skilled
labor, the plants of industry, the corridors of hospitals, the classrooms of learning.  Whatever
your pathway may be, I suggest four guideposts to assist in your respective journeys through life. 
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">They are easily remembered.  They are true friends to every traveler:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">First, GLANCE BACKWARD;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Second, LOOK HEAVENWARD;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Third, REACH OUTWARD;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">And fourth, PRESS ONWARD.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Let us consider each in its turn.  First, glance backward.  A review of the past can be helpful, that
is, if we learn from the mistakes and follies of those who have gone before and if we do not
repeat them.  John Toland, a Pulitzer Prize winning author, in summing up his monumental
work, The Rising Sun declared, </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><i>"I have done my utmost to let the events speak forthemselves; and if any
conclusion was reached, it was that there are no simple lessons in history, that it
is human nature that repeats itself--not history."</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">I have suggested merely a glance at the past, for it is not practical to think we can return.  Some
of you may be familiar with Thornton Wilder's classic drama Our Town.  If you are, you will
remember the town of Grover's Corners.  In the play, Emily Webb dies in childbirth, and we read
of the lonely grief of her young husband George, left with their four-year-old son.  Emily does
not wish to rest in peace; she wants to experience again the joys of her life.  She is given the
privilege to relive her twelfth birthday.  At first it is exciting to be young again, but the
excitement wears off quickly. The day holds no joy, now that Emily knows what is in store for
the future.  It is unbearably painful to realize how unaware she had been of the meaning and
wonder of life while she was alive.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Before returning to her resting place, Emily laments, "Do human beings ever realize life while
they live it. . .every minute?"  May each of us learn to appreciate the gift of life that we have
been given, and may the lessons we learn as we glance backward help us to live more fully each
day of our future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Now that we have glanced backward, let us look heavenward. From the heavens came the gentle
invitation, "Look to God and live."  We have not been left to wander in darkness and in silence
uninstructed, uninspired, without revelation. One who knew and taught this truth was President
Harold B. Lee, who wrote this inscription on the title page of the Triple Combination of scripture
which he presented to his teen-age daughter:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

errors of man's philosophies, and thus grow in spirituality as you increase in
knowledge, I give you this sacred book to read frequently and cherish throughout
your life.</i></span></p>

graduates have had the blessing of receiving your education at an institution governed by the
principles and ideals of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  According to the
Mission Statement for Brigham Young University-Idaho, the number one goal of this school is
to <i>"build testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and encourage living its principles.&#8221;</i>   
Looking heavenward should be our lifelong endeavor. Some foolish persons turn their backs on
the wisdom of God and follow the allurement of fickle fashion, the attraction of false popularity
and the thrill of the moment.  Their course of conduct resembles the disastrous experience of
Esau, who exchanged his birthright for a mess of pottage.  And what are the results of such
action?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">I testify to you today that turning away from God brings broken covenants, shattered dreams,
and crushed hopes.  Such a quagmire of quicksand I plead with you to avoid.  You are of a noble
birthright.  Eternal life in the kingdom of our Father is your goal.  Such a goal is not achieved in
one glorious attempt, but rather is the result of a lifetime of righteousness, an accumulation of
wise choices, even a constancy of purpose and lofty ideals.  As we look heavenward, we will
receive divine direction.  I bear witness to you today that the sweetest spirit and feeling in all of
mortality is when we have an opportunity to be on the Lord's errand and to know that He has
guided our footsteps.  Very often on Sundays, when I am not otherwise assigned, I will attend a
sacrament meeting in one of the care centers located near my home.  There precious souls, all
confined to wheelchairs, meet in an attitude of worship.  Worthy priesthood holders from the
surrounding area are called as bishops or branch presidents to preside over the care center units,
and priests and deacons are assigned each week to bless and pass the sacrament.  One cannot
attend without being uplifted and inspired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">One Sunday a young man was to play the violin for the benefit of the elderly and incapacitated
throng.  He began, and as he played, his music became sweeter with each passing minute.  Tears
came to the young man's eyes as he later mentioned that the notes tumbled through his mind, one
following the other in perfect succession, that he had never played with such pure inspiration as
he had that particular day.  He proffered, "It wasn't my skill.  It was the yearning of this special
audience."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">At the same meeting, an elderly lady called out, "I'm cold!"  A priest at the sacrament table said
nothing, but arose and walked to her side.  He then removed his own jacket and placed it around
the shoulders of the lady who was cold.  To him I said, "What you have done today you will ever
remember. Your act of kindness reflects the nobility of your soul.  You have been as the good
Samaritan who aided the helpless traveler on the road to Jericho."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">As we look heavenward, we inevitably learn of our responsibility to reach outward.  To find real
happiness, we must seek for it in a focus outside ourselves.  No one has learned the meaning of
living until he has surrendered his ego to the service of his fellow man.  Service to others is akin
to duty, the fulfillment of which brings true joy.  We do not live alone--in our city, our nation, or
our world.  There is no dividing line between our prosperity and our neighbor's wretchedness.
"Love thy neighbor" is more than a divine truth.  It is a pattern for perfection.  This truth inspires
the familiar charge, "Go forth to serve."  Try as some of us may, we cannot escape the influence
our lives have upon the lives of others.  Ours is the opportunity to build, to lift, to inspire, and
indeed to lead.  The New Testament teaches that it is impossible to take a right attitude toward
Christ without taking an unselfish attitude toward men:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><i>"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren,ye have
done it unto me."</i> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">We may think as we please, but there is no question about what the Bible teaches.  In the New
Testament there is no road to the heart of God that does not lead through the heart of man.  The
Prophet Joseph Smith taught that a true Latter-day Saint </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

tear of the orphan, to comfort the afflicted, whether in this church, or in any
other, or in no church at all, wherever he finds them."</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">We cannot be careless in our reach.  Lives of others depend on us.  The power to lead is indeed
the power to mislead; and the power to mislead is the power to destroy.  Your leaders at
BYU-Idaho, from President David Bednar through the ranks of each professor and instructor,
have left their imprint upon you.  They reached outward and touched your lives.  They
understand that the mantle of leadership is not the cloak of comfort, but the robe of
responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">I have many memories of my boyhood days.  Anticipating Sunday dinner was one of them.  Just
as we children hovered at our so-called starvation level and sat anxiously at the table with the
aroma of roast beef filling the room, Mother would say to me, "Tommy, before we eat, take this
plate of food I've prepared down the street to Old Bob, and then hurry back."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">I could never understand why we couldn't first eat and later deliver his plate of food.  I never
questioned aloud but would run down to his house and then wait anxiously as Bob's aged feet
brought him eventually to the door.  Then I would hand him the plate of food.  He would present
to me the clean plate from the previous Sunday and offer me a dime as pay for my services.  My
answer was always the same:  "I can't accept the money.  My mother would tan my hide."  He
would then run his wrinkled hand through my blond hair and say, "My boy, you have a
wonderful mother.  Tell her thank you."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">You know, I think I never did tell her.  I sort of felt Mother didn't need to be told.  She seemed to
sense his gratitude.  I remember, too, that Sunday dinner always seemed to taste a bit better after
I had returned from my errand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Old Bob came into our lives in an interesting way.  He was a widower in his eighties when the
house in which he was living was to be demolished.  I heard him tell my grandfather his plight as
the three of us sat on Grandfather's old front porch swing. With a plaintive voice, he said to
Grandfather, "Mr. Condie, I don't know what to do.  I have no family.  I have no place to go.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">I have no money." I wondered how Grandfather would answer.  Slowly Grandfather reached into
his pocket and took from it that old leather purse from which, in response to my hounding, he
had produced many a penny or nickel for a special treat. This time he removed a key and handed
it to Old Bob.  Tenderly he said, "Bob, here is the key to that house I own next door.  Take it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Move your things in there and stay as long as you like.  There will be no rent to pay and nobody
will ever put you out again."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Tears welled up in the eyes of Old Bob, coursed down his cheeks, then disappeared in his long,
white beard.  Grandfather's eyes were also moist.  I spoke no word, but that day my grandfather
stood ten feet tall.  I was proud to bear his given name.  Though I was but a boy, that day I
learned a great lesson on reaching outward.  And while we reach outward, we have the
responsibility to press onward.  Whatever part you choose to play on the world stage, keep in
mind that life is like a candid camera; it does not wait for you to pose. Learning how to direct
our resources wisely is a high priority.  We don't have to keep up with the change--we have to
keep ahead of it.  As Ralph Waldo Emerson observed, </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><i>"You are sensitive to a thousand influences . . .instructed by the past . . . invited
by the future.  You are not born equal--you are born unique.  You have powers
that have come to you from a host of ancestors.  Your strengths are greater than
your weaknesses. Finding our strengths, our</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><i>unique powers, should be a purpose of the journey of life."</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Increasingly we hear from leaders in business, professions, and government that it is easy to find
people who can do what they are told but difficult to find people who know what to do without
being told.  In our chosen fields, the obstacles confronting us may be mountainous in their
appearance--even impassable in their challenge to our abilities.  Press onward we must, for we
understand full well that attacking is not solving.  Complaining is not thinking.  Ridiculing is not
reasoning.  Accountability is not for the intention but for the deed.  No man is proud simply of
what he intends to do.  Let us not be deceived.  Like the mice who voted to place a warning bell
around the neck of the cat, we may mistakenly feel that the problem has been taken care of
simply because we have discussed it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">To put it another way, machines are not creative or imaginative, nor even responsible. They are
simply tools, and tools do not work and serve mankind until skilled hands take them up. 
Because our tools are growing in complexity and in potential usefulness, we must grow in order
to use them both profitably and wisely.  Let us not be frightened.  Rather, let us be challenged. 
Only the human mind has the capacity for creativity, imagination, insight, vision, and
responsibility. And I urge you to develop your heart with your mind, to care as well as to think. 
You will go on learning after you leave this campus, for to cease learning is to cease existing. 
And the best way to prepare for your future does not consist of merely dreaming about it.  Great
men have not been merely dreamers; they have returned from their visions to the practicalities of
replacing the airy stones of their dream castles with solid masonry wrought by their hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family:Times New Roman, serif">Vision without work is daydreaming.  Work without vision is drudgery. Vision, coupled with
work, will ensure your success.  You have developed the skill to study - use it.  You have learned
the value of effort - apply it.  You have pursued the quest for excellence - continue it.  Your
future will present insurmountable problems only when you consider them insurmountable. 
Your challenge is to keep faith with the past while you keep pace with the future.</span></p>

calls it, "the great refusal."  And so he vanishes from the gospel history, nor do the evangelists
know anything of him further.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><font face="Times New Roman">Brigham Young 
University-Idaho</font></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">August 22, 2003 </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">President David A. Bednar</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">This is truly an historic occasion.  I believe there are those on the other side of the veil who are
aware of and participating in what is taking place on this campus today.  I have felt a tender spirit
all day.  I make no apology for my emotions, and I sense you are feeling exactly the same thing.</span><font face="Times New Roman"><br />
</font></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Today we recognize and reach back to the past, and we also look forward to and anticipate the
future.  One of the things that enables us to reach back and honor the past is to recognize
descendants of Jacob Spori who are here in attendance with us today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Jacob Spori and his wife Magdalena were the parents of six children.  They had thirteen
grandchildren and generations of other descendants.  We are pleased to have three of their
grandchildren with us today&#8212;two children of Elizabeth Spori Stowell, Jacob&#8217;s fifth child, and
one from his youngest daughter, Annie Spori Kerr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Sister Edna Stowell Taylor, would you please stand.  Sister Taylor was born in 1913 in Annis,
Idaho.  She is the second daughter of Elizabeth Spori Stowell.  Edna earned degrees from both
Ricks College and Brigham Young University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Brother Paul Stowell, would you please stand.  Brother Stowell, the seventh child of Elizabeth
Spori Stowell, was born in Rexburg in 1925.  He graduated from both Ricks College and Yale
Medical School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Brother Robert Kerr, would you please stand.  Brother Kerr is the eldest child of Annie Spori
Kerr.  He was born in 1914 in Ora, Idaho.  He graduated with the last high school class at Ricks
College and later attended the University of Idaho.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Brothers and sisters, I have been impressed by the parallels between what happened in the early
years of the twentieth century&#160;at Ricks Academy and what now is happening in the early years of
the twenty-first century at Brigham Young University-Idaho.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Construction of the original academy building was completed in the fall of 1903&#8212;in time for the
start of a new school year and the beginning of classes.  One hundred year later, this new
structure is likewise finished and will house students and classes during the fall of 2003.   On
November 12, 1906, Elder John Henry Smith of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles presided at
the dedication of the original academy building.  Today in 2003, President Thomas S. Monson,
first counselor in the First Presidency of the Church, presides at this dedicatory service.  In 1906
students, faculty, and church and civic leaders gathered to celebrate and anticipate the future of
Ricks Academy.  In 2003, we gather to reverence the legacy of Ricks College and to look
forward to the future of BYU-Idaho.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">In 1906, the edifice that later was to be named the Jacob Spori Building symbolized the
beginning of Ricks Academy.  In those early days there was a powerful spirit of pioneering, a
spirit of willing sacrifice, and a spirit of experimenting and serving.  Jacob Spori exemplified that
spirit.  How fitting that the first permanent structure on this campus eventually was named in
honor of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Over the decades of its existence, the original Spori Building was the heart of this campus and
the icon of the institution.  I wonder if any of the people assembled at that first dedicatory service
in 1906 could have imagined what would be here today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">In a similar fashion, the new Spori Building in 2003 represents the beginning of BYU-Idaho. 
There is on our campus today a renewed spirit of pioneering and sacrifice and experimenting and
serving&#8212;truly a rethinking of education.  And I wonder if any of us can possibly imagine what
will be here 100 years from now.  There will be an affection for this new Jacob Spori Building
just as there was and is an affection for the original Jacob Spori Building.  There will be stories,
and there will be memories, and there will be sacred remembrances.  How appropriate that
elements of and fixtures from the first Spori Building have been so tastefully incorporated into
this new building&#8212;a proper tribute to both the past and the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">As we today participate in the dedication of the Jacob Spori Building, we simultaneously look to
and reverence the past and look to and anticipate the future.  We honor those who have gone
before and done so much to make the present-day Brigham Young University-Idaho a reality. 
Brothers and sisters, there is a deep sense of history today as we walk on sacred, spiritual
pathways which others have previously prepared and walked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Those of us who now serve at BYU-Idaho acknowledge the hand of the Lord in the
establishment, in the development, and in the progress and advancement of this remarkable
institution.  And we pledge our hearts and our hands and our minds and our spirits in service to
the students who do now and will yet walk upon those same sacred pathways to obtain spiritual
and secular truth.  We will become the best we can become so we can most effectively teach and
serve those students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">For all of us, this gathering today is more than a dedicatory service.  It is a day of remembrance, a
day of reverence, and a day of recommitment.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">We are delighted that you could be here today and participate in this truly historic event.  I pray
that we will look to the past with fondness and gratitude and to the future with anticipation and
hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The Master lives.  The gospel has been restored to the earth in its fullness in these latter days. 
And this living Church is directed by a living Savior through living apostles and prophets.  I so
testify and witness in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>

forces of good increase under the leadership of Jesus Christ, there will be
growing battles between the two until the final confrontation.  As the issues

As these conflicts rage, either secretly or openly, the righteous will be tested. 
God&#8217;s wrath will soon shake the nations of the earth and will be poured out on
the wicked without measure . . . But God will provide strength for the righteous
and the means of escape; and eventually and finally truth will triumph</i>  (President
Ezra T. Benson, <i>I Testify</i>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensign</span>, November 1988, pg. 87).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Interestingly, President Benson used the language and imagery of warfare to describe this
ongoing confrontation and conflict between good and evil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My message to you this morning is very simple.  I testify and promise that the courage you will
need can be invited into your life through fervent prayer and diligent study of the Book of
Mormon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Have you ever wondered why so much is recorded in the Book of Mormon about war?  There
are approximately 100 recorded instances of armed conflict in the Book of Mormon.  The word
<span style="font-weight: bold">war</span> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">occurs 132 times in the Book of Mormon.  The war chapters of Alma 43-63 alone include more
than 50 pages- approximately 10 percent of the entire Book of Mormon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Why so much about war?  And how do the descriptions of wars and battles help us today in
seeking the gift of courage?  President Benson taught:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>The Book of Mormon was written for us today.  God is the author of the book.  It
is a record of a fallen people, compiled by inspired men for our blessing today. 
Those people never had the book- it was meant for us.  Mormon, the ancient
prophet after whom the book is named, abridged centuries of records.  God, who
knows the end from the beginning, told him what to include in his abridgment that
we would need for our day</i>  (President Ezra Taft Benson, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Conference Report</span>,
April 1975, p. 94).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Let me suggest that one of the primary reasons so much information is recorded about war in the
Book of Mormon is to help you and me in these latter days appropriately seek the gift of
courage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">What lessons do we learn about courage and war in The Book of Mormon?  We learn about the
strategies and tactics of those who oppose righteousness- and the defensive and protective
strategies and tactics of the righteous.  We learn that the righteous can be strengthened in battle
by the hand of the Lord.  And perhaps most importantly, we learn that small groups of the
righteous can escape from the grasp of their enemies or emerge victorious against overwhelming
opposing numbers and weaponry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Please note the blessings which are bestowed upon small groups of the righteous in the following
examples from the Book of Mormon.  In 1 Nephi chapter 14 verses 12 and 14 we read:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers
were <span style="font-weight: bold">few</span> . . .</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And . . . I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon
the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord,
who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with
righteousness and with the power of God in great glory</i> (emphasis added).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Though few in number and scattered throughout the earth, Nephi learned that the righteous saints
were blessed with the power of God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In Alma chapter 58, verses 10 and 11, we read about the prayers of the stripling warriors and the
blessings they received.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us
and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies . . . .</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with <span style="font-weight: bold">assurances</span> that
he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak <span style="font-weight: bold">peace</span> to our souls, and did
grant unto us great <span style="font-weight: bold">faith</span>, and did cause us that we should <span style="font-weight: bold">hope</span> for our
deliverance in him </i>(emphasis added).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">These valiant young men were blessed with the assurance of deliverance, with peace to their
souls, with great faith, and with hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now please notice in verses 12 and 13 what follows the reception of these spiritual gifts for
which the sons of Helaman had so earnestly sought.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And <span style="font-weight: bold">we did take courage with our small force </span>which we had received, and were
fixed with a determination to conquer our enemies . . . .</i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>And thus we did go forth with all our might . . . . </i>(emphasis added)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">My hope and prayer for each of you this morning is that you, like the sons of Helaman, will be
blessed with assurances, with peace, with great faith, and with hope- and that you will become </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#8220;exceedingly valiant for courage&#8221; (Alma 53:20).  We will live in sobering and trying times, but
we need not fear.  Our lights will shine ever brighter in a world that grows ever darker.  I again
testify that you will be fortified and blessed with courage as you pray earnestly and consistently
study the Book of Mormon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Now, I want to conclude on a personal note.  Sister Bednar and I love you.  We have so much
enjoyed visiting with you on campus and in your apartments, participating with you in home

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left"><b><font size="5">Joy in 
the Journey</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left"><b>Susan Bednar</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left"><font size="2">Brigham 
Young UniversityÂ–Idaho Devotional</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left"><font size="2">September 
9, 2003</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">About 2 years ago Elder Bednar came home with what he
thought was a great proposal.Â  Brother Ed Williams had invited us to accompany
him, other colleagues, and students involved in the Natural Science Field
Expedition program on a hike to the Teton Glacier.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I wasnÂ’t too keen on the idea at first.Â  Do I look like an
expert hiker to you?Â  After checking with several people about the skills required
and the physical rigors involved, I reluctantly told my husband I would go with
him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now that IÂ’ve had time to ponder this difficult yet
wonderful experience, I have discovered that many aspects of this hike are
analogous to your situation here at BYUÂ–Idaho.Â  Let me explain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The evening before this most excellent adventure began,
President and I drove over to Jackson Hole.Â  The sun was setting, and as I
gazed up at the Tetons from the road to Jenny Lake, my heart started to pound
as I realized where that glacier was.Â  It was so far up there on the
mountainside that I questioned my ability to ever complete the hike.Â  What on
earth was I thinking when I agreed to do this?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well, I didnÂ’t sleep very well that night.Â  Tossing and
turning in the motel bed, I could just envision myself nauseous from the
altitude, with a twisted ankle, abandoned by the side of the trail, only to be
devoured by a hungry grizzly bear.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many of you new freshman students may be experiencing some
of the same anxieties in relation to your educational hike here at BYUÂ–Idaho.Â 
Your mind may be whirling with concerns such as:Â  Â“Can I excel in these college
classes?Â  Will I be able to get along with my roommates?Â  What if I flunk a
test?Â  I donÂ’t know how to cook; IÂ’m going to starve!Â  Will I be able to
balance the demands of school and work and a social life?Â  Will this
homesickness ever go away?Â  What on earth am I doing here in Rexburg, Idaho?Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My 12-hour hike began on a well marked, gently sloped, and
easy-to-follow trail that gradually turned into a game trail which zigzagged
across the mountain.Â  As the incline became steeper, Brother Williams picked up
an old tree branch and gave it to me to use as a walking stick.Â  His helpful
suggestion that I stay right behind him and place my steps where he placed his
enabled me to keep the pace.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After each rest break, Brother Williams boosted our
confidence by saying enthusiastically, Â“I want you to know we have just
finished the hardest part of the hike,Â” even though we hadnÂ’t.Â  Impressive
students continually increased morale by encouraging and assisting one another.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You, too, will have caring adults who will offer you walking
sticks of support and will have you place your footsteps in theirs to assist
and guide you along as you make your way up the mountain of your educational
pursuits.Â  Students on campus will warm your hearts with their friendly hellos
and genuine smiles.Â  They will strengthen you with their kind acts of service
as they strive to exemplify the Spirit of Ricks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Though my hike was strenuous and exhausting, along the way
we stopped to admire the beautiful, blue-green water of glacial-fed Delta Lake,
nestled down in the bottom of a deep ravine.Â  We slowed down at times to study
the formation and composition of huge boulders that dotted the mountainside.Â 
We learned about alpine plants and animal habitats and about the power of
glacial ice to carve and create canyon crevices and valley floors.Â  We observed
a miniature, rabbit-like pika preparing a pile of greens for winter food
storage.Â  I marveled how this determined little creature built this gargantuan
haystack grass blade by grass blade.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You, too, will need occasional breaks from the rigors of
your academic hike.Â  DonÂ’t become so bogged down in your studies that you forget
to have joy in your journey.Â  Take time to pause and enjoy friendships,
activities, and rewarding social experiences.Â  There will be times when the
requirements of a heavy class load will become overwhelming, and you may feel
there is no way you can achieve all that is expected of you.Â  When those
stressful times come, and surely they will, remember the pica.Â  You, too, can
persevere in the huge task before you if you will not procrastinate and just
take one step at a time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Above the tree line, my hike became more strenuous and
difficult to navigate.Â  The power and force of the glacial ice inching its way
down the mountainside had produced a huge moraine in front of it.Â  This ridge
of debris and angular rocks stacked on top of one another created a steep and
unstable face on which we had to climb to reach the glacier.Â  Members of our
group were staggered across the moraine to prevent dislodging a large boulder
or rock that could fall and injure a hiker below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Climbing that moraine reminded me of the importance of never
creating a stumbling block for someone else.Â  Several years ago, President
Bednar and I met with a group of students who were new converts to the Church.Â 
They had come to BYUÂ–Idaho believing that all the students at this institution
would keep the commandments and would live the gospel honestly and with full
purpose of heart.Â  Some of these converts with tender testimonies had been
sadly disillusioned by the poor examples of a few of our students.Â  May we all
remember the words of Paul and the responsibility we have to be Â“an example of
the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in
purityÂ” (1 Timothy 4:12).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just so you know, with a few pushes and pulls from my
husband, I finally made it to the top of the moraine and the impressive edge of
the Teton Glacier.Â  President Bednar and I stood there, surrounded by the
stunning and majestic view of the pinnacles of the Grand Tetons.Â  They were so
close you could almost reach out and touch them.Â  The joyful feelings I experienced
are somewhat indescribable.Â  I perceived that I was standing on holy ground,
and I sensed the profound love of our Father in Heaven.Â  I knew I had received
assistance from others and strength beyond my own to be standing on the glacier
I had seen the night before from the road.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For those of you nearing graduation from this institution,
picture yourself standing in this auditorium, dressed in your cap and gown,
relishing the accomplishments of your hard work in your educational pursuits.Â 
May the spirit whisper to your heart that you are in a special place, a
set-apart place, even a sacred place here at BYUÂ–Idaho.Â  May you feel our
SaviorÂ’s love and know that in the strength of the Lord you have attained
much.Â  And may you leave here equipped with the spiritual and academic tools
necessary to climb the rest of the way to the summit of your lifeÂ’s mission.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a young girl growing up in Wyoming, I always viewed the
Teton Peaks from what I call the Â“front side.Â”Â  But many times during the past
six years, Elder Bednar and I have driven the road from Rexburg to Driggs and I
have seen the Tetons from the Â“back side.Â”Â  Each vista is beautiful in its own
way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I love these mountains.Â  These three peaks remind me of
priesthood government and organization, particularly the three members of the
First Presidency.Â  I testify that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is led
today by a living prophet and apostles.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These three peaks also signify the three pillars of
eternity.Â  I know that the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement of Jesus
Christ are key elements of our Heavenly FatherÂ’s plan of happiness for us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And lastly, to me these three majestic peaks represent the
Godhead.Â  I bear witness of the reality of God the Father, God the Son, and God
the Holy Ghost. Â These mountains characterize their power and strength.Â  Just
as a glacier has the power to carve a canyon out of a hillside, our Father in
Heaven has the ability to mold and change us if we allow Him.Â  And through the
grace of the SaviorÂ’s atonement, we can be lifted to the grand summit of
exaltation and eternal life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May the Holy Ghost guide us in our lifeÂ’s journey is my
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, good afternoon and welcome to the fall
semester at Brigham Young UniversityÂ–Idaho.Â  Sister Bednar and I welcome you to
campus and look forward to meeting and becoming acquainted with you.Â  BYUÂ–Idaho
is a remarkable place, and you are here at an important time in your life and
in the history of this institution.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I continue to be thankful for the counsel and direction we
were given by the leaders of our Church last April at general conference.Â 
Certainly, we received timely instruction about a wide range of important
doctrines and gospel subjects.Â  But I was most impressed by what was not said
at the conference.Â  At a time when the United States was waging war with Iraq
and a number of other political and economic events caused global concern, the
Brethren said relatively little about the war or world events.Â  As we all
recall, President Hinckley specifically addressed the subject of war and peace;
but the other Brethren made only brief mention of the conflict and world
conditions.Â  Instead, they focused their teachings upon basic gospel doctrines
and principles.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For example, Elder L. Tom Perry stated:Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>In a world of turmoil and
uncertainty, it is more important than ever to make our families the center of
our lives and the top of our priorities. </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He then emphasized the importance of creating a
gospel-centered home as a safe harbor from the storms of the adversary.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Neal A. Maxwell described one of the fundamental
choices of mortality:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Within the swirling global events,
events from which we are not totally immune, is humanityÂ’s real and continuing
struggle:Â  whether or not, amid the cares of the world, we will really choose,
in the words of the Lord, Â‘to care . . . for the life of the soulÂ’</i>
(Doctrine and Covenants 101:37).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Maxwell proceeded to discuss continuing conversion to
Christ and the outcomes of this ongoing process. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Elder Richard G. Scott began his conference message by
asking:Â  Â“Who does not have need of assurance in times of uncertainty and
testing?Â”Â  He then continued and taught and testified of the sustaining power
of faith in times of uncertainty and testing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Without extensive or even any reference to current world
difficulties, President Monson taught about the treasure map that will lead us
to eternal happiness, President Faust spoke to righteous parents with
disobedient children, President Packer described the importance of valuing
folks in their golden years for what they are, Elder Haight testified of the
power and authority of the holy priesthood, Elder Nelson addressed the sweet
power of prayer, Elder Oaks highlighted gratitude </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">and giving thanks in all things, Elder Ballard reviewed the
essential role of member missionary work, Elder Wirthlin focused upon the
unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, Elder Hales discussed how faith through
tribulation brings peace and joy, Elder Holland emphasized the parental role in
teaching children the truths of the restored gospel, and Elder Eyring recounted
how the Lord trusts His true disciples.Â  As a people we were richly fed, both
by what was said and what was not said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As Sister Bednar and I drove back to Rexburg from general
conference last April, we commented on the absence of hand wringing and
commiserating and worrying and fussing and stewing among the Brethren.Â  Truly,
the Brethren individually and collectively were an example of steadiness and
firmness in turbulent times.Â  To our minds came the words from King Benjamin
found in Mosiah 5:15:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Therefore, I would that ye should be
steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord
God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye
may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power,
and justice, and mercy of him who created all things, in heaven and in earth,
who is God above all.Â  Amen. </i>(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We also reflected upon the condition of the Church on the
American continent shortly before the appearance of the Savior to the people of
Nephi in the Land of Bountiful, as described in 3 Nephi 6:14:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>And thus there became a great
inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up;
yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the
land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true
faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast,
and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.</i>Â 
(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am thankful for these modern and ancient examples of
disciples who are steadfast and immovable.Â  Their examples have caused me to
ask myself over and over again the following questions:Â  (1) What does it mean
to be steadfast and immovable?Â  (2) How do we become steadfast and immovable?Â 
(3) What blessings are associated with being a steadfast and immovable disciple
of the Savior?Â  Let me briefly address each of these three questions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><u>What does it
mean to be steadfast and immovable?</u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The word Â“steadfastÂ” is used to connote fixed or secure in
position, solid and firm in substance, unshaken, and resolute (<u>Oxford
English Dictionary</u>, 2nd Edition, Vol. VII, pp. 689-690).Â  The word
Â“immovableÂ” is used to indicate that a person or thing is not subject to
change, unalterable, and firmly fixed; it also suggests the quality of being
unyielding and incapable of being diverted from oneÂ’s purpose <u>(Oxford
English Dictionary</u>, 2nd Edition, Vol XVI, p. 589).Â  Thus, a person who is
steadfast and immovable is solid, firm, resolute, firmly fixed, and incapable
of being diverted from a primary purpose or mission.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the scriptures we find many noteworthy examples of
individuals who are steadfast and immovable.Â  Captain Moroni, as described in Alma
48:11-13, 17, is one such striking example:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>And Moroni was a strong and a mighty
man; he was a man of a perfect understanding; yea, a man that did not delight
in bloodshed; a man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his
country, and his brethren from bondage and slavery;Â  </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Yea, a man whose heart did swell
with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and blessings which he
bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and
safety of his people.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Yea, and he was a man who was firm
in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with an oath to defend his people, his
rights, and his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Yea, verily, verily I say unto you,
if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the
very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never
have power over the hearts of the children of men.</i>Â  (emphasis added)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The two thousand stripling warriors also can accurately be
characterized as steadfast and immovable.Â  Please turn with me to Alma
53:20-21:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>And they were all young men, and
they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity;
but behold, this was not all- they were men who were true at all times in
whatsoever thing they were entrusted.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Yea, they were men of truth and
soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk
uprightly before him.</i>Â  (emphasis added)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In both Captain Moroni and in the stripling warriors, we
find the characteristics of firmness, of resoluteness, and of an absolute focus
upon a compelling and correct purpose.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A classic nonscripture illustration of being steadfast and
immovable is found in AesopÂ’s fable <i>The Hare and the Tortoise</i>:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>A Hare one day ridiculed the short
feet and slow pace of the Tortoise, who replied, laughing:Â  &quot;Though you be
swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race.&quot;Â  The Hare, believing his
assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed
that the Fox should choose the course and fix the goal.Â  On the day appointed
for the race the two started together.Â  The Tortoise never for a moment
stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the
course.Â  The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep.Â  At last waking
up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal,
and was comfortably dozing after his fatigue.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What is the implication of this simple but profound fable?Â 
Slow but steady wins the race.Â  The tortoise made consistent and persistent
progress on the prescribed course, displayed a determined sense of direction
and discipline, and exhibited both strength and stamina.Â  This modest creature was
a model of being firmly fixed and resolute in his strategy of steadiness in the
race against the hare. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><u>How do we
become steadfast and immovable?</u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A building or structure that is stable and steadfast and
immovable must be built upon a strong foundation.Â  Note in the picture now
displayed on the screens how the building on the right stands firm and strong
in the aftermath of the waves and fierce winds from a tropical storm.Â  This
structure clearly was built with strong materials and upon a sturdy foundation.Â 
And notice how the buildings on the left deteriorated and crumbled from the
forces of the storm because of less effective construction and weak
foundations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In like manner, if you and I desire to become disciples of
the Master who are steadfast and immovable, we must be built appropriately and
effectively upon Him as our foundation.Â  Please turn with me to Helaman 5:12:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember
that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that
ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty
winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty
storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to
the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built,
which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i>Â 
(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As this verse affirms, the Lord Jesus Christ is the
foundation upon which we must build our lives.Â  He is a sure foundation.Â  And
you and I cannot and will not fall if we build upon Him as our foundation.Â 
This is a truly remarkable and faith promoting promise.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The steps we must follow in building our devotion to and our
character upon the foundation of Christ are identified simply and clearly in
Helaman 15:7-8:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>And behold, ye do know of
yourselves, for ye have witnessed it, that as many of them as are brought to
the knowledge of the truth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions
of their fathers, and are led to believe the holy scriptures, yea, the
prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written, which leadeth them to faith
on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance bringeth a change
of heart unto them-</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Therefore, as many as have come to
this, ye know of yourselves are firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the
thing wherewith they have been made free.</i>Â Â  (emphasis added)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please notice the specific steps outlined in these two
verses:Â  (1) belief in the teachings and prophecies of the holy prophets as
they are recorded in the scriptures (2) fosters faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ.Â  Faith in the Savior leads to (3) repentance.Â  Faith in Christ and
repentance bring about (4) the mighty change of heart.Â  Therefore, as many as
have come to this, meaning as many as have diligently and faithfully followed
these steps, are (5) firm and steadfast in the faith.Â  That, brothers and
sisters, is the LordÂ’s blueprint for becoming steadfast and immovable.Â  I
testify that as we follow in faith the building blocks described in these
verses, we will be strengthened and blessed to become steadfast and immovable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><u>What blessings
are associated with being a steadfast and immovable disciple of the Savior?</u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, a number of notable blessings are
associated with being a steadfast and immovable disciple of the Savior.Â  Let me
now suggest two of these blessings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, as we become more spiritually mature and increasingly
steadfast and immovable, we focus upon and strive to understand the fundamental
and foundational doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.Â  Disciples
who are steadfast and immovable do not become fanatics or extremists, are not
over zealous, and are not preoccupied with misguided gospel hobbies. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Joseph F. Smith emphasized:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>We frequently look about us and see
people who incline to extremes, who are fanatical.Â  We may be sure that this
class of people do not understand the gospel.Â  They have forgotten, if they
ever knew, that it is very unwise to take a fragment of truth and treat it as
if it were the whole thing.</i>Â  (<u>Gospel Doctrine</u>, p. 122)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And Elder Bruce R. McConkie stated:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>It is . . . my experience that
people who ride gospel hobbies, who try to qualify themselves as experts in
some specialized field, who try to make the whole plan of salvation revolve
around some field of particular interest to them- it is my experience that such
persons are usually spiritually immature and spiritually unstable.Â  This
includes those who devote themselves- as though by divine appointment- to
setting forth the signs of the times; or to expounding about the Second Coming;
or, to a faddist interpretation of the Word of Wisdom; or, to a twisted
emphasis on temple work or any other doctrine or practice.Â  The Jews of JesusÂ’
day made themselves hobbyists and extremists in the field of Sabbath
observance, and it colored and blackened their whole way of worship.Â  We would
do well to have a sane, rounded, and balanced approach to the whole gospel and
all of its doctrines.</i>Â  (<u>Doctrines of the Restoration</u>, p. 232,
emphasis added)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let me repeat and reinforce this first great blessing
associated with being a steadfast and immovable disciple of the Savior; such a
follower of Christ consistently is focused upon and striving to understand the
fundamental and foundational doctrines of the restored gospel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Second, as we become more spiritually mature and
increasingly steadfast and immovable, we are less prone to zealous and
exaggerated spurts of spirituality followed by extended periods of slackness.Â 
Recall the tortoise in AesopÂ’s fable to whom I referred earlier as an example
of steadiness and persistence.Â  The hare, on the other hand, is a classic
example of a Â“spurterÂ”- one who is given to short bursts of spectacular effort
followed by frequent and lengthy periods of rest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A spurt may appear to be impressive in the short run, but
steadiness over time is far more effective, far less dangerous, and produces
far better results.Â  Three consecutive days of fasting ultimately may not be as
spiritually effective as three successive months of appropriate fasting and
worship on the designated fast Sunday.Â  An attempt to pray one time for five
hours likely will not produce the spiritual results of meaningful morning and
evening prayer offered consistently over five weeks.Â  And a single
scripture-reading marathon cannot produce the spiritual impact of steady
scripture study across many months.Â  As Elder Neal A. Maxwell has taught:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>. . . measured steadiness is more
efficient than spurts and then a slackening.Â  Further, we are less apt to
&quot;wear away&quot; in prudent persistence than in a combination of
breathlessness and ease.Â  Sometimes we may reward our breathlessness with a
respite that turns into a permanent repose; we do this by reflecting on all that
we have done up to now and how it is surely now someone else's turn.</i>Â  (<u>Wherefore
Ye Must Press Forward</u>, pp. 73-74)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Spencer W. Kimball likewise taught about the
importance of steadiness and consistency in our spiritual development and
progress.Â  In explicating the parable of the ten virgins he stated:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>The foolish [virgins] asked the
others to share their oil, but spiritual preparedness cannot be shared in an
instant.Â  The wise had to go, else the bridegroom would have gone unwelcomed.Â 
They needed all their oil for themselves; they could not save the foolish.Â  The
responsibility was each for himself.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>This was not selfishness or
unkindness.Â  The kind of oil that is needed to illuminate the way and light up
the darkness is not shareable.Â  How can one share obedience to the principle of
tithing; a mind at peace from righteous living; an accumulation of knowledge?Â 
How can one share faith or testimony? How can one share attitudes or chastity,
or the experience of a mission?Â  How can one share temple privileges?Â  Each
must obtain that kind of oil for himself.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>The foolish virgins were not averse
to buying oil.Â  They knew they should have oil.Â  They merely procrastinated,
not knowing when the bridegroom would come.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>In the parable, oil can be purchased
at the market.Â  In our lives, the oil of preparedness is accumulated drop by
drop in righteous living.Â  Attendance at sacrament meetings adds oil to our
lamps, drop by drop over the years.Â  Fasting, </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>family prayer, home teaching,
control of bodily appetites, preaching the gospel, studying the scriptures-
each act of dedication and obedience is a drop added to our store.Â  Deeds of
kindness, payment of offerings and tithes, chaste thoughts and actions,
marriage in the covenant for eternity-these, too, contribute importantly to the
oil with which we can, at midnight, refuel our exhausted lamps. </i>(<u>Faith
Precedes the Miracle</u>, pp. 255-256)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The key lesson for us to learn from both AesopÂ’s fable and
from the parable of the ten virgins is the same- deliberate, consistent, and reliable
preparation and performance Â“wins the raceÂ” and provides essential oil for our
lamps.Â  Furthermore, steadfastness is a prime indicator of spiritual maturity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, you and I can learn much about steady
spiritual development from the technique of drip irrigation that is used in
many agricultural areas throughout the world.Â  Drip irrigation is sometimes
called trickle irrigation and involves dripping water onto the soil at very low
rates from a system of small plastic pipes fitted with outlets called emitters
or drippers.Â  Unlike surface and sprinkler irrigation, which involves flooding
or gushing or spraying large quantities of water where it may not be needed,
drip irrigation applies water close to a plant so that only part of the soil in
which the roots grow is wetted.Â  Please notice in the video you are now
watching that with drip irrigation, applications of water are more focused and
more frequent than with the other methods.Â  The steady drips of water sink deep
into the ground and provide a high moisture level in the soil wherein plants
can flourish.Â  In like manner, if you and I are focused and frequent in
receiving consistent drops of spiritual nourishment, then gospel roots can sink
deep into our souls, can become firmly established and grounded, and can
produce extraordinary and delicious fruit.Â  In a gospel sense, brothers and
sisters, you and I need to become intelligent drip irrigators and avoid
sporadic and shallow spiritual spurting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sturdy gospel roots that go deep into rich spiritual soil
strengthen and steady us in times of trial and difficulty.Â  One of the leaders
of the Church once related to a group of religion instructors (see Robert L.
Millet, <u>I Will Fear No Evil</u>, p. 18) that not long after he had been
called as a General Authority someone planted a bomb at the door of the Salt Lake
 Temple.Â  The bomb had exploded and knocked the large, heavy door off its
hinges.Â  He commented that the episode was chilling to him and created an
anxiety and discomfort, a fear, that lasted all day.Â  To his utter surprise, he
noticed that all through the day, in the many meetings he attended with other
General Authorities, no mention was made of this scary incident.Â  Finally, at
the end of the day, he asked one of the senior Brethren about the temple door,
only to have his colleague remark, Â“Yes, we need to get that fixed, donÂ’t we.Â”
Then he added this important principle, one that will help each of us to be
steadfast and immovable as we move into ever more troublesome days ahead:Â  Â“We do
not take counsel from our fears.Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">None of us will ever forget what we saw and what we felt on
the morning of September 11, 2001.Â  The events of that day changed the world
and all of our lives in a profound way.Â  At 10 oÂ’clock on September 12, I was
with the First Presidency, six members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,
and other general Church leaders in a meeting of the Board of Trustees that
oversees the affairs of the entire Church Educational System.Â  As I was
preparing to participate </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">in that Board meeting, I said to my wife, Â“What would any
member of the Church give to be in this setting with these Brethren and these
sisters today, given what took place yesterday?Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is customary that we all arrive quite early for meetings
of the Board.Â  I entered the west boardroom of the Church Administration Building
and shook hands with all of the men and women who were there.Â  President
Hinckley was not yet in the room; he is always the last to arrive.Â 
Interestingly, as I talked with those in the room and listened to other
conversations, not one word was mentioned about the events of the previous
day.Â  The Brethren were discussing current and anticipated assignments and
other matters of ongoing Church business.Â  Then the door opened and President
Hinckley walked into the room.Â  He greeted everyone and shook our hands, and he
moved to his place at the head of the table and sat down.Â  All of the rest of
us then sat down.Â  President Hinckley looked at us and simply said, Â“Brothers
and sisters, we live in sobering times.Â  Now letÂ’s get to work.Â” That is all
that was said.Â  An invocation was offered, and the Board meeting began.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Steadfast and immovable.Â  Less than 24 hours after the awful
events of September 11, I was in the presence of the LordÂ’s prophet who provided
the perfect example of being steadfast and immovable- solid, firm, resolute,
firmly fixed, and incapable of being diverted from a primary purpose or
mission.Â  Â“LetÂ’s get to work.Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brothers and sisters, such examples of firmness and
steadfastness are not restricted to prophets and other prominent Church
leaders.Â  You and I, in our individual lives and in our respective spheres of
influence, can likewise become steadfast and immovable.Â  In our desire and
determination to keep and honor covenants and commitments, in our desire and
determination to live worthy and pure lives, in our desire and determination to
become valiant disciples of the Savior, truly we can become steadfast and
immovable. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lord Jesus Christ is the foundation upon which we must build
our lives.Â  He is a sure foundation.Â  And you and I cannot and will not fall if
we build upon Him as our foundation.Â  Please pay particular attention as we now
sing together verses three and seven from the hymn </p>

speak about the great importance of being happy and joyful. All of us intrinsically
want to be happy. Why? Because we were born to be happy. The Prophet Joseph
Smith explains:  <i></i></span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080"><i>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be
the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path
is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the
commandments of God </i>(TPJS p.225). </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">So, not only are we created to be happy, <span style="text-decoration: underline">but</span> we have been given the plan to
achieve that happiness, which plan is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. That is why the
gospel is referred to as &#8220;<i>A the great plan of happiness.&#8221; </i>(Alma 42:8)  The Gospel
is not the plan of sorrow, or  affliction, or discouragement. It is not the plan of
restrictions or frustration. It is the plan of happiness and joy&#33;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">The Book of Mormon tell us: <i></i></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080"><i>Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have
joy </i>(2 Nephi 2:25). </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Adam fell. We are here. The question is: Do we have joy in our lives? If not, we
are falling short of what God created us for and what He expects us to achieve.
He wants us to be happy.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">But He is not talking of worldly happiness or pleasure. He is talking of eternal
happiness and joy and that takes time and comes &#8220;line upon line.&#8221;  We must be
patient, but we must keep working at it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">While the scriptures teach that a fullness of joy comes in the next life, I testify
that we can have plenty of it right here and now. At times our joy can become so
near full that we can feel things that are beyond mortal understanding - things so
glorious that our comprehension of what this earth is all about is changed forever.
These glimpses may be microscopic or milli-seconded but they are real and
important and powerful and available&#33;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Paul teaches, &#8220;for now we see through a glass darkly, but then, face to face . . . we
now know in part&#8221;  but then in full. [1 Corinthians 13:12] We do see and know,
albeit darkly and in part. We had better experience some happiness and joy here,
for it is my belief that we can only feel &#8220;a fullness&#8221; in eternity of that which we
feel &#8220;in part&#8221; now. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">I promise all of you that the more fully you live the principles of the Gospel the
more joy you will feel and the more often you will feel it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Some ask: How do you define joy and happiness? Listen to Brigham Young&#8217;s
explanation:</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080"><i>If the heart is cheerful, all is light and glory within; there is no
sorrow. </i>(6:41) <i>When man is <span style="text-decoration: underline">industrious</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">righteous</span>, then is he
happy.</i> (9:244) <i> Learn to be happy. Where is happiness, real
happiness? Nowhere but in God. By possessing the spirit of our
holy religion, we are happy in the morning, we are happy at noon,
we are happy in the evening; ...Every Latter-day Saint, who has
experienced the love of God in his heart, after having received the
remission of his sins, through baptism, and the laying on of hands,
realizes that he is filled with joy, and happiness, and consolation.
He may be in pain, in error, in poverty, or in prison, if necessity
demands, still, he is joyful. </i>(18:213)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Simple: work hard, live the gospel and you will be happy. There is a wonderful
work ethic here in Idaho. There is also a marvelous heritage of living the Gospel
here. How blessed you are to be at BYU-Idaho. No matter where you are from,
work very hard, live the Gospel exceedingly well and you will fill your lives with
joy.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Remember, happiness and joy are not things that just happen to us but are feelings
we slowly but surely develop within ourselves, with God&#8217;s help.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">My dear young friends, I promise you with all the energy of my soul: Keeping
God&#8217;s laws will always bring joy - sometimes now, sometimes later. Following
Satan&#8217;s ways will always bring misery &#8216;- sometimes now, sometimes later.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">It is not only our right, but our responsibility to be happy. If we are not happy and
confident, if we do not <span style="text-decoration: underline">demonstrate</span> the joy of the gospel in our lives, how can we
expect others to desire it? If we are happy in our lives and project that happiness
to the world at large, they will seek to find the source of our joy. What an
opportunity and responsibility&#33;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">When we fall short in joy and happiness it is usually because we are not living the
Gospel plan the way we should.  Make up your minds to change in any way
necessary to bring more happiness and joy into your life.  Concentrate on
specifics. They come from every aspect of life.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">There are many. I will mention just a few specific sources of joy.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Joy comes from sacrificing for others, or for a noble cause.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Joy comes from being clean.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Joy comes from knowing you have really helped someone.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Joy comes from feeling confident that the path you are following is
pleasing to God.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">But most of all, joy comes from loving another person with all of you heart, and
feeling their heartfelt love. We may not all have found our &#8220;true love&#8221; here, but I
hope we have all found true love for our Savior and felt His love for us. I love
Him and I know He loves each one of us.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">I only have time to discuss three sources of joy. However, I challenge all of us to
choose those sources we need to improve in and really work on them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline">First:</span><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline">Joy comes from feeling and expressing gratitude:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">True happiness and joy are such deep feelings that at times words are totally
inadequate to express them. Then we have to express them in song and dance and
music and at times shouts of  &#8220;Hosannah&#8221; and &#8220;Hurrah&#33; For Israel&#8221;&#33;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">I lived among the Polynesians who are a remnant of the House of Israel. They
often expressed their feelings in exuberant dance and song and poetry and shouts
of joy. Their very natures were ingrained with the feelings expressed by the Old
Testament Psalmist:</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080"><i>&#8220;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, . . . come before his presence
with singing.&#8221;</i>  (Psalms 100:1-2)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">My first companion, Feki Po&#8217;uha, was a master at these types of expression. How
he could sing and dance and express his feelings for the Gospel&#33; What a great
companion&#33;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">In making the movie &#8220;The Other Side of Heaven&#8221; they did a good job of
capturing Feki&#8217;s character and his deep understanding of what is truly important
in life. I&#8217;d like you to see and feel his enthusiasm. Following the clip the Choir
will sing &#8220;Hurrah for Israel&#8221;. Listen carefully, for we will all sing it later.  <span style="font-weight: bold">[CLIP:
Feki]</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Feki has been dead for over 30 years. I still see and feel his contagious smile, his
happy spirit, his confident character, and his sincere expressions of gratitude.
They live forever. All of us should smile more, laugh more, express more
gratitude and have more confidence. Fake smiles won&#8217;t do, but true smiles that
come from deep within work wonders. Our laughter should not be giddy or
boisterous, but appropriate. If we think good thoughts and do good things God
has promised us that our &#8220;confidence shall wax strong&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenants
121:45).  Don&#8217;t rely solely on clothes or make up and hair do&#8217;s to make you
attractive. A confident smile reflecting true inner joy is a marvelous and powerful
thing. Let me illustrate.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Jean and I met on a blind date set up by our sisters who played together in the
BYU Symphony Orchestra. Neither of us were anxious to go on that date, as we
had never even met each other, but we both trusted our respective sisters.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">For me it was love at first sight. For Jean it took a little longer. Despite what the
movie might imply I was not a very good dancer. I am grateful that Jean &#8220;hung in
there&#8221; and that five years after that first meeting we were sealed in the Los
Angeles Temple.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">One of the things that immediately attracted me to Jean was her radiant smile and
her happy, confident spirit. I sensed these came from the depths of a pure soul.
President Hinckley recently said: <i>&#8220;Wear a smile on your face, and have a song in
your heart as you serve the Lord.&#8221;</i>  I agree and repeat: Let&#8217;s smile more, laugh
more and express our joy and happiness for life in word, song, dance, and other
appropriate ways. Let&#8217;s enjoy life more and have more fun.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">However, never let the world define what &#8220;fun&#8221; is for you.  If the world defines
&#8220;fun&#8221; as suggestive or sexy dress, song, dance, lyrics, movements, activities, etc., 
and you fall for it, don&#8217;t be surprised when that type of fun turns to bitter ashes.
On the other hand, if you confidently say, I know the proper place of these things.
I know what God&#8217;s standards are and I will keep them, then you won&#8217;t be
surprised when joy and happiness flow and grow therefrom. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Second:</span><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline">Joy comes from doing what you know is right.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Let me show another brief clip to demonstrate this principle. Sometimes you can&#8217;t
&#8220;explain&#8221; our standards to others in a way they can accept. I have learned,
however, that with the Lord&#8217;s help, feelings can change, hearts can be softened
and virtue can be protected.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">At the conclusion of this clip Jean will express her feelings to you.  <span style="font-weight: bold">[CLIP: Noli]</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Jean S. Grogerg comments:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">What wonderful memories I have of BYU. I loved everything about it -  my
classes, my roommates and dorm life, my involvement in the Church and school
activities. John mentioned our first date - it was to a &#8220;Priesthood Ball.&#8221; Later we
enjoyed devotionals, concerts, forums, talking and walking down Campus Hill to
an old swing. There are great times to be had without spending money&#33; We both
dated other people, but the more we got acquainted with others, the more we were
drawn to each other.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">When John left on his mission we agreed to write. So for three years I wrote
&#8220;Dear John&#8221; letters while continuing a busy life that included studying, dating,
graduating, then going on to teach school in California.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Letters played a significant role in our lives. Often a letter John had written
months earlier would arrive at just the right time, sharing an experience or some
counsel that helped solve a concern I had right then. I began measuring myself
and others to the mark of what I could tell John was becoming, and I knew I
wanted to be available when he returned. The Lord blessed us both to be patient
and always added extra help. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">During my senior year, I tried to think of something appropriate to send John for
Christmas. I didn&#8217;t want to distract him from his missionary work, but I wanted to
send something. My helpful roommates encouraged me to send a photo of myself.
&#8220;Too presumptuous,&#8221; I thought, as  he had never asked for a picture nor given me
one of himself.  My roommates persisted, and since I couldn&#8217;t think of anything
else I could afford to mail, I sent him one. Never did I suspect it, but at the same
time he sent a passport picture of himself to me&#33; These two photos crossed in the
mail and both did great amounts of good on the other end.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Was it coincidence that my picture arrived in Tonga on the very day it was
needed to provide John a tangible form with which to reason with an otherwise
unreasonable mother? I don&#8217;t believe so. And all the letters I received at just the
right time saying just the right thing, were they coincidence? I don&#8217;t believe so.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">When we strive to learn the Lord&#8217;s will, then do our very best to follow it, the
Lord will work with us where we are, to help us get where we should be. He uses
daily events and people in our lives to give us opportunities to keep our promises
to Him. As we do all we can, He directs events, and magnifies our humble efforts
until His purposes and promises are realized - both in our lives and in the lives of
those we touch. That is how we experience true  joy.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">I testify that our loving Father in Heaven knows and loves us individually. He
sent us here at the right time and place to learn and grow and serve to our fullest
potential. I know that Jesus Christ&#8217;s all en-compassing love for His Father and for
each of us, as expressed in His infinite Atonement, has made it possible for us to
return to Their presence. I pray we might do so, In the name of Jesus Christ,
Amen.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Elder John H. Groberg continued:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">We recently celebrated our 46th Wedding anniversary and I can truly say we are
more in love now than ever. I did not think it possible to have stronger feelings
for someone than I did for Jean right from the first, but I have learned while those
feelings may not be stronger, they can become deeper and broader and more all
encompassing.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">The more experience I have and the more understanding of the Gospel I gain, the
more excited I am about life. We should all be excited about life - about the
Gospel, about the Savior&#8217;s Love, about a living Prophet, about all the
opportunities of eternity placed within our grasp. Be enthusiastic about all aspects
of life - about love, about getting married and staying married, about having a
family. Say in your hearts: I can do this - even if my parents or close friends have
been divorced or had what we may term a poor marriage. We can start a new
trend. We can have faith; we know others who have done it successfully and we
can too.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Third:</span><span>&#160;&#160;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline">Joy Comes From Love</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">Life is not all roses. We learn more from rough seas than we do from smooth
ones. Jean has saved my life both spiritually and physically many times. We all
need each other. Let me illustrate with a final clip. During a particularly fierce
storm I was thrown overboard. As I struggled to make it to shore I thought of
many things - my family, my friends, my mission - but when the final moment of
truth came, when my energy was gone, when I could have exited this life - the
Lord infused into my soul a picture of Jean. I saw her pure smile and determined I
must live to see her again. Thus, she literally, as well as figuratively pulled me
from the depths of despair and death, to the promise of love and life. We all know
it is the Savior who ultimately saves - but in this life He often uses others to help.
I have learned for myself that the power of love is <i>&#8220;stronger than the cords of
death.&#8221; </i> [D &amp; C 121:44] Determine to not complain, whatever your lot is, but
smile, be cheerful and help others in any way you can.  <span style="font-weight: bold">[CLIP: Storm at sea]</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">I know what it is like to be swallowed up in the depths of despair. I also know
what it is like to be brought out of the depths to the light - to where we can
breathe and live. I know the Savior can rescue each of us, no matter how scarlet
our sins or how deep our troubles. Trust Him, love Him, rely on Him. He has
been below all things and has now risen above all things. He understands
<span style="text-decoration: underline">everything</span>. The Savior suffered incredible pain for each of us, which caused Him
to <i>&#8220;tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body
and spirit&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenants 19:18)<i>.</i>   How grateful we should be for His
love, for His atonement and His resurrection and His promised final judgement.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000080">It is proper to focus on His suffering which was occasioned by His love for us and
His desire to help us and save us.  We can relate in a tiny degree to His suffering,
because He allows us to suffer a little - mostly to purge and purify us and give us
experience and patience.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Good afternoon Brothers and
Sisters. It is an honor to have this opportunity to speak to you today. It is
my hope and prayer that the spirit will attend us this day, and my message may
be of benefit to you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I had the opportunity as a
boy of being raised on a ranch. I had many opportunities to work outdoors side
by side with my father and three brothers. On our ranch we raised beef cattle,
sheep, horses and often had milk cows, chickens, and even pigs. On any given
day in the summer when we were not in school my dad would get us up early and
take us out to the fields and get us started on some task that needed to be
done that day. Sometimes we would be working together and other times we would
be left to ourselves to complete the task. It often seemed rather simple when
dad would describe what he would like us to do. But frequently it didnÂ’t turn
out that way. One day my dad took me to a pasture where our bucks (or rams)
were. He explained to me that he wanted me to herd the bucks from where they
were now to another pasture that was probably a half a mile away. He left me
with one of our dogs to help. It didnÂ’t seem like too difficult of a job. So I
told him I understood and he left. Our dog named Queen and I began to herd the
30 bucks towards our destination. Things were going quite well until we came
upon a stream of water that didnÂ’t have a bridge. For those of you who are not familiar
with sheep, they do not like water. Well I knew they didnÂ’t like water but I
could see that the water was not very deep so I thought I could get them to
cross the stream. So I began to yell and whistle and rush the bucks, trying to
scare them into the stream. I also knew that sheep would follow each other
almost anywhere, so I thought if I could get one across the stream the others
would likely follow. Even with the help of Queen we couldnÂ’t get the bucks to
go into the water. I even got so desperate that I caught one of the bucks and
waded out into the stream myself pulling the buck with me all the way to the
other side. I was thinking that if the others could see one on the other side
they would be willing to go across with it. Well, as I let go of the buck that
I had just pulled across onto dry land, he could see the other sheep on the
opposite side of the stream and he jumped back into the stream and went back to
where the others were. Now I was standing on the opposite side of the stream by
myself, and the bucks were all running off in the other direction. What seemed
to be a simple task had become very complicated and challenging.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I think that sometimes our
lives our like this experience, in that we may be going along living life quite
smoothly and then an unexpected obstacle may get in our way. Sometimes these
obstacles are created by our own bad choices and other times we had nothing to
do with putting the obstacle there. Regardless of the source of the challenge
it can be very difficult to overcome and seem overwhelming to us. Fortunately,
we have been given tools to assist us as we face these challenges in our lives.

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As
you seek spiritual knowledge, search for principles. Carefully separate them
from the detail used to explain them. Principles are concentrated truth,
packaged for application to a wide variety of circumstances. A true principle
makes decisions clear even under the most confusing and compelling
circumstances. It is worth great effort to organize the truth we gather into
simple statements of principle.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">At times in our lives, the
trials we are facing do seem to be very compelling and confusing. It is
comforting to me to know that if I apply correct principles to my challenges
the decisions that I make can become clearer. Elder Boyd K. Packer explained, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to respond to problems of everyday living, even failures, for they to are
provided for in the doctrines.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Principles are general and
abstract; they do not refer to specifics. Principles relate to the Â“big
picture.Â”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Living by principles means
using them to make decisions in the situations we encounter. I would like to
mention three of these gospel principles that I feel would help us as we face
the challenges in our lives. I recognize that this is not a complete list of
principles to apply; however, it is a place to start. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The first principle that I
would like to discuss is humility. Humility is defined in the Webster
dictionary as Â“modesty in self estimation.Â”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>President Gordon B. Hinckley, in his book <u>Way to Be</u>, describes
humility this way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">Being humble does not mean being weak. It means
being teachable. It does not require us to be trampled upon. It means
acknowledging where our strengths and abilities come from. It also means
recognizing that we are not here on earth to see how important we can become,
but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I like the word teachable as
a word to describe a person who is humble. A willingness on our part to look
carefully at our role in creating, or contributing to the challenges we are
facing is of great importance. It is frequently the case that when trials are
before us that we will do one of two things. We will either quickly take all of
the responsibility on ourselves as if we are the ones that caused or created
the problem, or we will quickly look for someone else to blame for the problem.
I don</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">t believe that either of these approaches works very
well, or follows correct principles as we are taught in the gospel of Jesus
Christ. I think it is our responsibility to honestly assess our role in the
problem we are facing. We should accept responsibility for our part and to
allow others to accept responsibility for their own actions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We are taught many gospel
truths in these few verses. It seems that we can all relate in some way to this
parable. Whether we are the parent of a wayward child, or if we are or have
been the wayward child, or maybe we can relate more to the older brother in
this parable. The older brother is the one I would like to focus on for a few
minutes. He is described in the parable as always being faithful and obedient.
He certainly was not responsible for the poor choices his brother made as he
wasted his inheritance. It is easy to see why he felt angry when he came home
to find his father throwing a party for his brother who had been so foolish.
All the years of his obedience his father had never thrown a party for him.
Feeling that he hadn</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">t been treated fairly, he became angry and wanted an
explanation. His wise father taught him clearly of eternal blessings that would
be his based on his faithfulness. He also helped him see the need of humility
on his part, which would allow him to begin the process of forgiving his
brother. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">That leads us into the second
principle that I would like to discuss today. That is the principle of
forgiveness. In our lives we experience things that are hurtful. Sometimes the
person responsible for the pain is very much aware that they are hurting us,
other times they may not be aware that there actions are going to result in
pain for us. Sometimes the pain that is felt is very deep and may last for a
long time even years. Other instances it is more superficial and not as long
lasting. In my professional career I have had the opportunity of trying to help
very sincere individuals with this very difficult task of forgiving someone who
has hurt them. It is not an easy principle to master, but it is one that will
bring great peace into our lives as we successfully apply this principle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">To illustrate the potential
results of not using this principle President Gordon B. Hinckley relates the
story of Guy de Maupassant, the French writer. He tells the story of a peasant
named Hauchecome who came on market day to the village. While walking through
the public square, his eye caught sight of a piece of string lying on the
cobblestones. He picked it up and put it in his pocket. His actions were
observed by the village harness maker with whom he had previously had a
dispute. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Later in the day the loss of
a purse was reported. Hauchecome was arrested on the accusation of the harness
maker. He was taken before the mayor, to whom he protested his innocence,
showing the piece of string that he had picked up. But he was not believed and
laughed at. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The next day the purse was
found, and Hauchecome was absolved of any wrongdoing. But, resentful of the
indignity he had suffered because of a false accusation, he became embittered
and would not let the matter die. Unwilling to forgive and forget, he thought
and talked of little else. He neglected his farm. Everywhere he went, everyone
he met had to be told of the injustice. By day and by night he brooded over it.
Obsessed with his grievance, he became desperately ill and died. In the
delirium of his death struggles, he repeatedly murmured, Â“A piece of string, a
piece of string.Â” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">President Hinckley goes on to
explain. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">With
variations of characters and circumstances, that story could be repeated many
times in our own day. How difficult it is for any of us to forgive those who
have injured us. We are all prone to brood on the evil done us. That brooding
becomes as a gnawing and destructive canker. Is there a virtue more in need of
application in our time than the virtue of forgiving and forgetting? There are
those who look on this as a sign of weakness. Is it? I submit that it takes
neither strength nor intelligence to brood in anger over wrongs suffered, to go
through life with a spirit of vindictiveness, to dissipate one</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">s abilities in planning retribution. There is no peace
in the nursing of a grudge. There is no happiness in living for the day when
you Â“get even.Â” </span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">My thoughts go back to many
years ago when I was working with a young woman who had been hurt badly by a
member of her family whom she loved and trusted. The type of hurt she received
manifested itself in her with emotional instability. She struggled with
interpersonal relationships and had a lot of feelings of self-doubt. As we
talked about her feelings for this family member it became apparent to both of
us that she had not been able to forgive this person for what they had done.
This young woman was a person of great talent and ability. Almost anything she
put her mind to she seemed to succeed at. However, since the bitterness and
anger had settled into her heart, there were few things that she was doing up
to her capability. Almost all aspects of her life were on a downward spiral.
She worked very hard trying to forgive this family member for the hurt that she
felt. It was not an easy or a fast process, but it was one that when she was
successful with, it produced a tremendous feeling of freedom and peace. The
family member that had harmed her initially was repentant and the beginnings of
a new relationship occurred. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Along with the feelings of
peace that come to us as we forgive others who have offended us, there are
opportunities for meaningful relationships. To illustrate this idea let</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">s recall Nathaniel Hawthorne</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">s novelette Â“The Scarlet Letter.Â”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>The community where Hester Prynn lived would
not allow her to put the sin of adultery behind her by causing her to wear a
scarlet Â“AÂ”</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>
</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">on her chest for as long as she
lived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>Even though Hester goes on to
become a great asset to the community by being a selfless nurse and a doer of
good deeds, the community continued to insist that she wear the scarlet letter.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">After several years a few of
the people in the community began to see Hester in a different way. The scarlet
Â“AÂ” began to signify something other than adultery to them. To them it stood
for Â“able or angel.Â”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â  </span>To those few who
were able to forgive Hester for the sin she had committed, she became a real
friend that was a blessing to their lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">If we turn back to the
parable of the Prodigal Son the Savior teaches us so clearly of the joy that is
felt when we have a forgiving heart. The father in this parable was not only
willing to forgive he was anxious to forgive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â 
</span>It seems to me that he had already forgiven his son before his son ever
came back and asked to be forgiven. Our inability to forgive others is an
obstacle in our lives that limits and hinders our personal growth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">President Hinckley said <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">A spirit of forgiveness and an attitude of love and
compassion toward those who may have wronged us is of the very essence of the
gospel of Jesus Christ. Each of us has need of this spirit. The whole world has
need of it. The Lord taught it. He exemplified it as none other has exemplified
it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">If we think about our Savior
hanging on the cross and asking his father to forgive them for they know not
what they do, it would seem that it would be in our best interests to do all we
can to forgive those who have offended us, as difficult as it may be to free
ourselves of the burden of bitterness and holding a grudge. Again there is
great peace and freedom that comes into our lives by applying the principle of
forgiveness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The third principle that I
would like to discuss is the ability to have an Eternal Perspective. As we face
life</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">s challenges, having the ability to look at the
situation with an eternal perspective will assist us greatly in our
decision-making. Having the ability to see the end from the beginning is of
great use to us. Robert Millet, a professor at BYU frequently gives his
students the final exam during the first week of the semester. The students
obviously do poorly on the exam during the first week of the semester, however
they begin to see all that they may learn over the course of the semester. They
study and learn with the end more clearly in sight. As members of the Church of
Jesus Christ we are blessed with knowledge of eternal truths. We understand
that we lived with our Heavenly Father before coming to this earth. We
understand the purpose of this earth life as a time to prepare to meet God.
This life is a time to be tried and experience many opportunities for growth
and learning. We also understand that after we leave this life that we have
opportunities to continue on in our progression. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

accumulated during 15 hours worth of swimming in the currents off Catalina, nor
the lack of endurance. There was still sufficient stamina to complete the last
few hundred yards of the, 26 mile journey. But Florence was helped out of the
water less than </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>2</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> mile from the shore, a short distance from being the

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">We are placed here on earth to progress toward our
destiny of eternal life. These truths give us a unique perspective and
different values to guide our decisions from those who doubt the existence of
God and believe that life is the result of random processes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Several years ago I had the
opportunity of doing some work inside a State Prison. Prior to entering the
prison for the first time, I was quite nervous. I had built up in my mind some
preconceived ideas of what it would be like inside a state penitentiary. Having
never been inside one before my imagination went wild. The only thing I had to
work with was what I had seen in the movies, and you know how reliable that is.
As I arrived at the prison the first day it looked more like the movies than I
thought it would. The fences had razor wire across the top; there were tall
guard towers with real live guards with guns standing in them. As I entered the
inside of the facility a guard located in a protected booth opened every door
that I went through. The door would slide open, I would walk through then it
would slide shut behind me before the next door would open in front of me. I
never did get completely comfortable with that process. I guess I always had
some part of me that worried that they might not let me out some day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The inmates that I met inside
the prison were men who did not use an eternal perspective to help them face
their life</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">s challenges. One evening I had one of the inmates
approach me and asked if he could visit with me privately. He introduced
himself. I will call him John. He said to me, Â“You</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">re a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints, arenÂ’t you?Â” I told him that I was. He told me that he was also a
member of the church. He asked if I had served a mission. I told that I had.
John then told me that he was a return missionary as well. I asked John what
his experience was like as a missionary. He described it as being wonderful.
With tears in his eyes he shared his feelings about the church and our Savior.
As we talked further we found out that we served in the same mission, with the
same mission president, but not quite at the same time. I had gone home a few
months before he entered the mission field. John served faithfully as a
missionary, introducing the gospel to many people. I asked John if he would
share with me how he ended up in prison.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">He told me he had been raised
in a LDS home. He attended primary as a child and mutual as a young man. John
was faced with some challenges in his life as a youth and he began to drift
away from activity in the church. He started experimenting with drugs and
alcohol. This behavior increased to the point that he became addicted to
heroin. He began committing crime to support his drug habit and was sentenced
to prison at age 18. He served a short sentence and was released form prison
and decided to turn his life around. He went back to church with a sincere
heart and expressed a desire to serve a mission. He served successfully and
after his mission he decided to pursue his education at BYU. Things were going
quite well for John for quite some time. Then some challenges came into John</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">s life. He made some poor choices as he tried to deal
with these trials and returned to the use of heroin, which again led him down
the path toward prison. That is where I met him, in prison, incarcerated for
many more years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As I think back on John</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">s experience it touches my heart. Here is a man who
has a testimony of the Savior and his teachings. He is an intelligent man with
a mind that is capable of producing much good. Yet he was not able to apply
gospel principles in his life when he was faced with difficult situations.
Instead of looking at his trials with eternal eyes he looked at them with
temporal eyes and chose shortsighted solutions to the situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In my minds eye I can still
see a young boy alone on the other side of the stream watching the bucks run
away. My father did not send me out on the ranch to fail, but rather to learn
from the challenges that I would face. Elder Richard G. Scott said,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Have Learned from Students</font></span></p>

<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you very much, and good afternoon, my brothers and sisters.  Because of the many things I
have learned from students and about students during my years as a teacher, if the Lord will bless
me to do so, I wish today to persuade you to a particular view with regard to your educational
objectives and perhaps even to other significant matters in your life, such as missions and
marriage.  </p>
<p>One of my favorite stories is about the man who every day at work complained vociferously
about his lunch.  After listening to this for months, one of his fellow workers said, &#8220;If you dislike
your lunch so much, why don&#8217;t you ask your wife to fix you something different?&#8221;  To which the
fellow responded:  &#8220;My wife has nothing to do with this.  I fix my own lunches.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are fixing our own lunch at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Ã¢Â€Â“</font>Idaho, creating our own educational product.  I think, at
times in a rather unintentional but still meaningful way, sometimes students regard their
educational process a little bit like they regard ordering a pizza.  When you order a pizza, your
great concerns are:  what kind of crust, what kind of topping, and will I have it delivered, carry-out, or dine in?  Well, at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Ã¢Â€Â“</font>Idaho there is no carryout, there is no dine in, and there are no
ready-made or made-to-order pizzas.  At this place, and at most other educational institutions that
I am aware of, it is a make-and-bake deal.  You start from scratch.  We provide the ingredients;
you must create the product.  </p>
<p>Now, when you think about that for a minute, that applies to missions.  What a wonderful thing it
is when a missionary goes home pleased with the mission he has created.  It is rather the opposite
when a missionary, on occasion, goes home and is aware of the fact that there was no pre-made
mission experience for him or her&#8212;that all he has to go home with is what he created through his
faith, his obedience, his testimony, his goodness.  The tools used to do this creating are wide-ranging and multifaceted.  They include faculties, facilities, academic rigor, and not
insignificantly, spiritual insight.  It is upon the spiritually oriented tools that I will focus.  </p>
<p>Not long ago, just a matter of days, we had on our campus representatives of some major home
building companies in America.  One company was among the very largest.  And there were
from this company about six vice presidents and an executive vice president.  They were here to
interview our students and to hire them and to invite them to internships.  A lunch was held, and
during the lunch this group of executives was asked, &#8220;What is it you need from our students?&#8221; 
And the answer was very quick in coming.  It was one word.  They said, &#8220;Integrity.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I am going to tell you a sweet little story about my grandfather.  My grandfather was a simple
man.  He never owned a car; he never drove a car.  He literally earned his living by the sweat of
his brow.  He had many gifts, many of them were distinct, but they were not the kind of gifts that
would bring upon him the acclaim of the world.  </p>
<p>When I was sixteen, he passed away.  The viewing for my grandfather&#8217;s funeral was held in our
home.  As a sixteen year old, I loved my grandfather.  I was among the older grandchildren and
knew him longer than most.  I stood not far from his casket as friends and neighbors came to pay
their respects.  As I stood there, a rather prominent, well-known man in our community stood
lingering some time at my grandfather&#8217;s casket.  Presently, he was joined by another fellow; and I
heard this exchange between them.  </p>
<p>The first individual said, &#8220;Ed Wilkes was the most honest man I ever knew.&#8221;  And then he told
this story.</p>
<p>He had purchased a school bus.  In those days school buses were privately owned in our part of
the world, and parents would pay a fee to have the school bus pick up their children.  My
grandfather could not afford the fee to have his son, my dad, ride the school bus.  So it was the
case that as the school bus would go to and from school it would pass this young man, this
student, my dad, on the road; and it bothered the fellow who owned the bus.  He went to my
grandfather and said:  &#8220;It really bothers me to pass your boy up on the road.  I would like to have
him ride.&#8221;  My grandfather responded that he could not afford to pay the fare.  The man who
owned the bus said that didn&#8217;t matter to him.  My grandfather responded, &#8220;I do anticipate that I
will have some money coming at the end of October on a given date (I have forgotten the date); 
and if you would like to carry my son on your bus, I will, on that given date, pay you his fare. 
That was readily agreed to.  </p>
<p>The date late in October came; and on that day, there was a horrific blizzard.  It was heavy snow
and wet.  It was cold.  About eleven o&#8217;clock at night, the fellow telling this story heard a knock at
his door.  He opened it and there, standing in this blinding storm, was my grandfather.  He said,
&#8220;I have come to pay you the money that I owe for carrying my son.&#8221;  The fellow said: &#8220;My
goodness, I did not expect you to come in this weather.  I could have waited another day or two.&#8221; 
And then this response:  &#8220;Perhaps you could have waited for the money, but I could not delay
bringing it to you.  It was for me that I brought it tonight.  I need to know that my word is good.&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard this account told by the man who was party to the bargain and knew that my grandfather
was a poor man who died rich.  &#8220;I need to know that my word is good.&#8221;  </p>
<p>How critical it is for each of us to know that we are men and women of integrity, that our word
can be counted on whether the circumstances are convenient or inconvenient.  Under all
conditions, we need to know for ourselves that we are persons of integrity.  Would you not wish
to know such about the person you marry?  Would you not wish to know such about the children
you will raise?  Would you not wish to know such about the person or firm that employs you and
upon whom you rely for promised compensation?  Are you not comforted to be assured that the
God of heaven with whom you have made covenants will keep His word?  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though 
the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away but shall all be 
fulfilled . . . </i> (Doctrine and Covenants 1:38).</p>
<p>Again from the Doctrine and Covenants:  <i>&#8220;Wherefore, if ye believe me, . . . &#8221;</i> There is a
poignancy and a pathos in that statement.  Who would not believe Him?  Who among us today
would not believe the Lord?  And yet, it was incumbent upon Him to say:  <i>&#8220;. . . if ye believe me,
ye will labor while it is called today&#8221;</i>  (Doctrine and Covenants 64:25).</p>
<p><i>&#8220;And behold, I, the Lord, declare unto you, and my words are sure and shall not fail . . . .&#8221; </i>That
can also be said of you if you make it so.  Concluding, <i>&#8220;But all things must come to pass in their
time&#8221;</i>  (Doctrine and Covenants 64:31-32).  </p>
<p>And so, brothers and sisters, the first tool of the capacity to create is integrity, and the second is
the patience borne of faith that allows things to happen in the Lord&#8217;s own time.  I have learned
much from you.  I will tell you of a student; I will call her Ann.  That is not her name. </p>
<p>Ann was a young woman with many friends; and, as it turned out, one of her friends was a
member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  In the process of this rather large
group of young women being friends, the member of the Church invited the others to hear the
missionaries teach their discussions.  Ann was one of those who went.  She later told her mother
that she had gone and heard the Mormon missionaries, which startled her mother a great deal
because she was staunch (as was Ann&#8217;s dad) in her own faith.  The young woman assured her
mother that it was really only a lark, that it was just kind of fun to hear what they had to say.  She
said, &#8220;Mother, if it will make you feel better, every time I hear the missionaries I will go to our
church leader and have him explain what was wrong about what I heard.&#8221;  The mother reluctantly
agreed.  But as the daughter continued to listen, the power of the Spirit touched her life and she
came not to believe but to know that what she was hearing was true.  Her mother had earlier said,
&#8220;If you ever join the Mormon Church, don&#8217;t tell me and don&#8217;t tell your dad because it would kill
us to know that.&#8221;  She agreed that she would not.  </p>
<p>As the time came of decision about joining the Church, she decided two things.  She decided to
join the Church, and she also decided that she would not tell her mother and dad because they
had asked her not to. </p>
<p>Over time she came to believe in her own heart that somehow they knew and had accepted it, and 
life would be fine.  That was not the case.  Ann decided to apply and come to Ricks College.  
She did so, and upon arriving the first night, she called back home to tell her parents that she was 
safe and so happy and so excited.  In the meantime, her parents had learned from a neighbor that 
Ann had joined the Church.  When her parents picked up the phone and she bubbled over about 
her happiness, there was no response until finally her mother said, &#8220;Ann, we have learned that 
you joined the Mormon Church, and your father and I are trying to forget that you ever existed.&#8221;  
And there was a click.  </p>
<p>Ann immediately sought the comfort and help of the Lord in prayer and then of her bishop.  She
was counseled that the only thing she could control in this matter was what she did.  She was
encouraged to write to her parents every week and to reaffirm her love for them and her joy in
doing good things.  She began to do that, and she did that through all the fall semester and all of
the winter semester until the very end.  She came in again to her bishop, as she had done on a
number of occasions, discouraged and feeling that she had been forgotten both by her parents,
whom she loved, and by the Lord who had not answered her prayers.  She was once again
reassured and went home.  Later that evening, the phone rang.  </p>
<p>Now remember the scripture, the Lord said, &#8220;. . . my words are sure and shall not fail . . . But all
things must come to pass in their time.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The phone rang; Ann answered and heard this:  &#8220;Ann, your father and I could not forget that you
existed.  We love you, and we need you; and we wondered if there was any way you could come
home this weekend because there are some things we wish to say to you.&#8221;  Ann responded: 
&#8220;Mother, there are some things I wish to hear.  I&#8217;ll be home this weekend.&#8221;  </p>
<p>There is a wonderful strength that comes with the patience borne of faith.  In 1 Nephi, chapter 21,
quoting lines from Isaiah beginning in verse 14, the Lord said: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>. . . behold, Zion hath said: The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
forgotten me&#8211;but he will show that he hath not.  </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion
on the son of her womb?</i></p>
<p>Can a mother forget her baby?  &#8220;Yea, they may forget,&#8221; as strange as that sounds and as unlikely
as it is: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>...yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel. </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually
before me.</i></p>
<p>And skipping over to verse 23 toward the end:  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i> . . . and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, for they shall not be ashamed that
wait for me.</i></p>
<p>I pray for you and for me the faith and the patience to wait for the Lord.  Some of you may have
issues at this very moment that you are waiting for.  The solutions have not yet come.  It may be
family; it may be opportunity; it may be understanding; it may be companionship; it may be a
clearer vision of who you are or what you are to be; it may be a witness properly and faithfully
sought after.  Whatever it is one might seek or however slow it may seem to be in coming, if it is
praiseworthy and for one&#8217;s good and in harmony with the mind and will of God, you should be
assured that he has not forgotten you and that your life, like all of our lives, is in fact continually
before him.  </p>
<p>And so the tools of the one capable of creating good things include integrity and the patience
borne of faith. </p>
<p>I have learned of the remarkable capacity students have to pack a load.  I am amazed at what
some of you accomplish.  I watch you do your schoolwork and excel, and have jobs, and attend
to Church matters, and render service, and, in some cases, care for families.  </p>
<p>In order to create, one must be willing and capable of packing a heavy load, of working hard. 
While caution and prudence must be exercised in this matter, the truth is most of us are
underloaded rather than overloaded.  </p>
<p>I learned an interesting little lesson about this one day.  It was a number of years ago and four-wheel-drive pickups were just starting to be the thing to have.  Before that they had been mostly
army vehicles and some heavy construction-type vehicles.  But in the mid- to late 70s they started
to be sought after, and wanted, and available.  </p>
<p>I convinced myself that because I wanted one, I needed one.  I went to my sweet wife Estella and
said, &#8220;I need a four-wheel-drive truck.&#8221;  And she said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t either.&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;I do too!&#8221; 
She said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve lived all this time without one.  Why do we need one now?&#8221;  And I said: 
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll just explain that to you.  What if we had a terrible blizzard and I needed to go down to
the store and get milk for our children and the only way I could get through would be with a four-wheel-drive pickup?  How about that?&#8221;  And she said, &#8220;Well, then go get you a four-wheel-drive
pickup and it won&#8217;t matter because we won&#8217;t have any money to buy milk for the kids, even if
you can get to the grocery store!&#8221;  Well, being of a cautious nature and wanting to provide for my
family, I went and got a four-wheel-drive pickup.  And then I couldn&#8217;t wait to see where it could
go.</p>
<p>I next felt that I needed to get us some firewood stored away.  So I went to the mountains; it had
already snowed.  At the lower end of the mountain road, it was a skiff; but the further I went, the
deeper it got.  I knew it was becoming risky, but how could I stop?  This wonderful piece of
equipment had all the power and all the traction&#8212;and I could just go and go.  </p>
<p>So I went too far.  I pulled off where I could get a load of wood; and as soon as I stopped, I was
stuck.  All the wheels spun.  All four of them spun in the snow.  I was rather embarrassed.  I was
a little frightened and worried, and I was very humble.  I did not know what to do; but I thought,
&#8220;As long as I don&#8217;t know what to do, I might as well cut some wood and load this truck.&#8221;  And so
I did.  I loaded it high and full and heavy.  And then because I did not know what else to do, I
decided to try it one more time.  As I put it in gear and applied power, I could feel it moving out
of the snow and back onto the road.  I was free to go home.  </p>
<p>I have thought so many times it was the load that freed me.  It was the load that gave me
mobility.  It was the load that carried me forward.  </p>
<p>I learned something on one occasion listening to Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles.  It was an area training meeting for mission presidents in October of 1996.  We
were assembled in Nauvoo, and Elder Nelson was presiding.  Someone asked him the question,
&#8220;Elder Nelson, in your busy life prior to your call as an Apostle, you were a world- renowned
heart surgeon, you were a stake president, you were many other things.  How did you find time? 
How did you get all of it done?&#8221;  And then he told us a very interesting thing.  He said:  &#8220;I
discovered that I could get up as early as I wanted to and the time was mine.  I typically would
get up at six.  I started to get up at five and study the scriptures and teach myself to play the
organ.&#8221;  And then one day he heard the Prophet say, &#8220;We ought to learn a foreign language, and
some of us ought to learn Chinese.&#8221;  So Elder Nelson said, &#8220;I got up earlier, and I learned
Chinese.&#8221;  And then he told us what a remarkable gift and blessing that had been to him as an
Apostle in carrying out his assignment.  Brothers and sisters, I pray for all of us to have the
strength to pack a load. </p>
<p>I conclude with one more tool.  I have observed that the happiest among you refuse to whine.  I&#8217;ll
say that one more time.  I have observed that the happiest among you refuse to whine.  Please
envision this scene in the real life happening of a little boy and his dad.  </p>
<p>The little boy is five.  He loves his big wheel.  He is known in the neighborhood as the &#8220;big-wheel king.&#8221;  His big wheel is not an ordinary one.  It is jet black with wide tires and a gold
cobra on the side.  </p>
<p>His favorite thing to do was to back up against the garage door of their home, shoot down the
driveway through the dip in the gutter and out into the street.  His parents warned and warned
and warned.  And he would promise and then forget.  One day it was such that after he had
promised and had sincerely meant not to do it again, he did it again; and he received a little
paddle.  No child abuse involved here, I&#8217;m sure.  And he cried, and through his tears he said to
his father, &#8220;All you want to do is ruin all my fun.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t know who you are, but there is someone here who has some of those kind of
feelings.  Not only about this place, but about the Church, and maybe even about the Lord
himself&#8212;that the whole intent and purpose seems to be to ruin our fun. </p>
<p>The dad assured him that was not the case, and the little boy was left with the commitment not to
do it again.  Weeks, even months, passed.  </p>
<p>One Sunday they returned from church; and as the family went inside, the little boy, in a forgetful
moment, got on his big wheel and tore down the driveway.  His dad, just entering the living
room, could see him going down the driveway and the neighbor coming home from church; and
he could see out in the middle of the street where they were going to meet.  He ran to the door to
holler out a warning, but it was too late.  He got there and saw the big wheel struck by the car. 
He ran to the street.  Gratefully and fortunately and happily, the little boy was scraped and
bruised, but not critically injured.  His big wheel was under the car.  And as the dad pulled him
out from under the car, the little boy said these remarkable words:  &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Dad.  I won&#8217;t
ever do that again.&#8221;  </p>
<p>What a journey between &#8220;All you&#8217;re trying to do is ruin all my fun&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Dad.  I
won&#8217;t do that again.&#8221;  What happened?  One thing.  He came to understand what his mom and
dad had always known&#8212;those who create seek to understand rather than to whine.  </p>
<p>We all remember the account in the second chapter of 1 Nephi where we learned that Laman and
Lemuel murmured against their father.  &#8220;And they did murmur because they [understood] not the
dealings of that God who had created them.&#8221;  Instead of seeking to know and to understand, they
murmured and they murmured.  </p>
<p>There is only one place that I&#8217;ve ever found in the record where Laman and Lemuel were happy. 
It&#8217;s in the seventh chapter when they believe erroneously that Nephi has failed in his attempt to
build a ship.  They were so happy, and they said, <i>&#8220;We knew [you] could not [build] a ship&#8221;
</i>(1&#160;Nephi 17:19).  </p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we each ought to examine our lives and consider what it is that makes us
happy.  It could not possibly be the case that the only thing that makes you happy is someone
else&#8217;s failure.  </p>
<p>Nephi, on the other hand, said that he had great desires to know the mysteries of God.  And so he
prayed, and he asked, and he said, <i>&#8220;. . . [The Lord] did visit me, and did soften my heart . . . .&#8221; </i>
(1 Nephi 2:16).   </p>
<p>Do you know what softens the heart?  Understanding.  One of the great experiences of life is to
be confronted with a situation that frustrates us, angers us, disturbs us in some way and then
come to understand the true circumstances and say, &#8220;Oh.  Ahhh.&#8221;  Then&#8212;if we are real men and
women, which I firmly believe that you are&#8212;we say, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;  We say that to roommates, we
say that to brothers and sisters, we say that to friends, we say that to moms and dads. &#160;We come
to understand.  Our hearts are softened.  We move on.  </p>
<p>I pray for the strength to do such&#8212;to have integrity, to pack a load, to have the patience borne of
faith, and to refuse to whine but to wait upon the Lord in trust and belief.  And I do so in the
name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>My beloved young brothers and sisters, as I look out over this wonderful gathering of the youth
of Zion and contemplate the many thousands who are gathered in other locations on campus, I
am humbled and excited by your presence. Humbled by the awesome responsibility of sharing
the things of my heart with you beloved sons and daughters of God and excited at the potential
which exists in this great army of soldiers who are all enlisted in the cause of truth. You have the
opportunity to be the leaven in the loaf, the messengers of the good news of the gospel of Jesus
Christ, and living examples to the world, that you can be doers of the words of our Redeemer and
not hearers only. I plead with you to never weary in well-doing and as the Savior said to his
apostles at the Last Supper...</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them</i> (John 13:17).</p>
<p>I have pondered and prayed at length as to what I might teach you this day that could be helpful
to you as a doer of something which is very important to the Lord. I have found something which
the Lord spent a great deal of time and energy teaching and practicing, that I feel can help you to
be successful, happy, and very useful in helping to build the Lord&#8217;s kingdom.</p>
<p>I am going to introduce the principle with a very old and somewhat light-hearted song I knew as
a boy which most of you won&#8217;t know and I certainly won&#8217;t sing it to you, but the lyrics went
something like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>You gotta accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative, latch on to the
affirmative, and don&#8217;t mess with mister-in-between.</i></p>
<p>Now you may wonder about me when I use such a strange little ditty to introduce a very
important gospel principle when I could have used a song like &#8220;Let Us Oft Speak Kind Words To
Each Other.&#8221; However, I thought, knowing college students as well as I do, the little ditty might
stick with you a bit longer and serve as a reminder of what I am going to try and teach you. Now
for the principle I want to teach. My concern is that in the world today I&#8217;m afraid too many
people would change the lyrics of my little song to match the negative, cynical, contentious spirit
that seems to occupy so much of our time. I think their lyrics would sound something like this;
You&#8217; gotta accentuate the negative, eliminate the positive, let go of the affirmative, and don&#8217;t
mess with mister-in-between.</p>
<p>It seems that far too many people have become almost obsessed with fault finding, back biting,
criticizing, contending one against another, and in general making sure that &#8220;an eye for an eye&#8221; is
never replaced by the golden rule.</p>
<p>The media has become enamored with the idea of what they call &#8220;reality programming,&#8221; where
they take selected groups of people and sequester them in some remote or inaccessible location
and let them try to intellectually do each other in through deception, manipulation, contention, or
any other contemptible means until there is only one person left standing to claim the large
monetary prize.</p>
<p>News broadcasters, talk shows, newspapers and other periodicals seem to spend the majority of
their time and space on the negative, the controversial, the contentious, and the sensational.
When asked why they give so much attention to these types of stories they respond, &#8220;because that
is what sells newspapers and TV time and is what the public wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t think this nation is preoccupied with contention, check out how much we spend for
legal fees each year.</p>
<p>When I was a small boy we owned a chicken farm. I remember my father would always council
us to watch the chickens in the pens carefully because if we ever saw a chicken with a tiny spot
of blood on it we had to catch it and put tar on the blood spot because if we didn&#8217;t, in a very short
time, all of the other chickens would take the chicken with the small blood spot and pick it to
death. I hope we can rise above the mentality of a chicken and when we see a weakness or flaw
in our neighbor, we don&#8217;t, as a group, set about to destroy them. </p>
<p>Instead of picking on others like a chicken let&#8217;s follow the Saviors admonition and pick others
up. In Doctrine and Covenants 81:5 the Savior declares</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>...succor the weak, lift up the hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble
knees.</i></p>
<p>The other day, I was reading President Hinckley's April 2003 Conference talk. He commented on
this. He has such a wonderful way of explaining things. He said: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When we look for the worst in anyone we will find it. But if we will concentrate on
the best, that element will grow until it sparkles...</i></p>
<p>Two thousand years ago the Prince of Peace, the Redeemer of the world came to this earth with a
message of peace, hope, love, forgiveness, and compassion. However, as with my little song, the
message of the Savior seems to be changed to different lyrics by too many naysayers to war,
despair, hate, revenge,and contention.</p>
<p>On both continents very early in His ministry, the Savior delivered what I call an inaugural
address to make a declaration of where He stood on basic issues, some of which were replacing 
basic beliefs held onto tenaciously by the Jewish hierarchy as well as the people in general. In the
Sermon on the Mount He repeatedly stated, &#8220;ye have heard that it was said by them of old,&#8221; and
then would replace portions of the &#8220;Law of Moses&#8221; with a higher law.</p>
<p>To me there is no replacement of the Law of Moses so plain and probably so controversial as in
Matthew 5:38-44. Would you turn to that scripture with me and let&#8217;s talk about it a little. Let&#8217;s
start with verse 38 and read those seven verses.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Ye have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
right cheek, turn to him the other also.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have they
cloke also.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not
thou away.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate
thine enemy.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them
that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.</i></p>
<p>This was a hundred and eighty degree turn from what these people had been taught. I&#8217;m sure it
would have been very difficult to completely change their philosophy of human relationships.
However, I have had a personal witness that this doctrine works. Let me share it with you. Many
years ago as I was starting my career as a school principal at the ripe old age of 27, the school
superintendent took me to the elementary school where I was to be the principal and introduced
me to my new faculty of 18 women teachers and 1 man teacher. I think the women teachers were
shocked at my young age but at least in the meeting they were polite to me. However, the male
teacher, Al, was not at all polite, he merely gave me a cold icy stare and refused to even shake my
hand.</p>
<p>After we had left the meeting and had gotten into the superintendent&#8217;s car, I said to him, &#8220;What
was Al&#8217;s problem?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Al is old enough to be your father. He has been at this school
over 20 years waiting for the previous principal to retire or die so he could get his job.  Need I
say more.&#8221; He continued, &#8220;Al doesn&#8217;t have a problem, you have a problem, it&#8217;s Al. Good luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Time proved the superintendent correct. I did have a very difficult problem. Al obviously hated
me. I had taken his job and it seemed that no matter what I did to be his friend, he threw up a
road block to stop it. I really felt that someday we were going to have a major confrontation
which I wanted to avoid if at all possible. I prayed that I might be wise and Christ-like in my
dealings with Al. I knew all of the faculty knew I was a Latter Day Saint and a bishop and I
didn&#8217;t want to do anything that would reflect negatively on the church and I sincerely wanted to
be the kind of person the Savior would have me be. This problem with Al caused me to have
nightmares. I remember one night I dreamed we were having a faculty meeting and Al and I got
into a fight and were rolling around on the floor while the lady teachers all stood around
screaming.</p>
<p>Fortunately that dream never came true but the confrontation did come. Toward the end of the
school year it was time for teacher evaluation. It was my job as principal to evaluate each of the
teachers. In each category I had to rate the teachers with one of three options. The highest option
was &#8220;Above District Standards, middle option was &#8220;Meets District Standards&#8221; and the lowest
category was Below District Standards. No one, of course, wanted to be evaluated &#8220;Below
District Standards&#8221; but I had agonized over one category for Al. He was constantly in
confrontations with all of the other teachers. He couldn&#8217;t get along with others and I&#8217;m sure that
is one of the reasons why he was not made the principal.</p>
<p>The wording in the evaluation category I had struggled over said &#8220;Rate this individuals ability to
relate well with fellow teachers.&#8221; To rate Al at any level but Below District Standards would
have been a lie so I bit the bullet and rated him accordingly. When he came into my office and I
handed him his evaluation sheet and he spotted the check mark in &#8220;Below District Standards&#8221;
that lit the fuse and the explosion began.</p>
<p>He stood over me and began to shout obscenities. By the way, I need to tell you he had been a
Navy Captain and his language reflected his acquaintance with obscene language.. He began by
attacking the University I attended, BYU-Provo, my church, my family, my youthful age, my
philosophy of teaching, etc. etc. etc. To be honest with you, I was amazed at how much he knew
about me. For about 15 minutes he screamed every filthy, negative and cutting remark about
everything he thought would be hurtful to me. I&#8217;m sure he had rehearsed in his mind that speech
for months and had waited for the right time to launch it. Then he just stopped and the room was
silent. For one thing, I think he was exhausted from screaming at the top of his voice for so long
and for another thing, I think he now wanted me to give a response so he could give his rebuttal
to whatever I might fire back at him.</p>
<p>I have to confess that there were many things that went through my mind that I would have liked
to say in response, but none of them would have been appropriate in light of my knowledge of
Matthew chapter 5:6 and 7. So for about two minutes I sat silently saying a mental prayer that I
would be guided to give the appropriate response.</p>
<p>Finally I broke the long silence, and in a very quiet voice I said, &#8220;Al, &#8220;whatever I have done to
you to make you hate me so badly, I apologize to you for offending you. I am very sorry. But I
want you to know something, I love you as my brother and I would like to be your friend.&#8221; Then I
said nothing more. The room was very quiet. I think Al was ready for almost any response I
might have given except for &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry if I have offended you, I love you, and I want to be your
friend.</p>
<p>We sat in silence for a few minutes and then Al did something I wasn&#8217;t prepared for. He began to
cry. He finally gained his composure and said these few words. &#8220;No one has ever told me they
loved me in my entire life. Not even my mother or father,&#8221; and with that he left the room.</p>
<p>In the months that followed Al and I became good friends and when I left that school to take
another assignment, Al came up to me, put his arms around me and began to cry. Finally he said,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to leave, you are the best friend I have ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to Matthew. I had that sweet experience with Al because I was smart enough to
follow the admonition of the Savior wherein he declares in Matthew 5:43-44:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine
enemy.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them
that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</i></p>
<p>Do we have the courage to follow the Savior&#8217;s admonition? It must be frustrating to the Savior
that almost two thousand years after he delivered this masterful discourse replacing the law of
Moses with a higher low of love, so many still practice the law of retribution, an eye for an eye.</p>
<p>I would like to make another observation about the Sermon on the Mount. He begins that talk by
giving the people the beatitudes. One of them particularly has meaning in our discussion today in
Matthew 5:9. The Savior declares,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God.</i></p>
<p>In that statement, it seems almost as if the Savior is saying, &#8220;I want the peacemakers to be in my
family. I&#8217;ll claim them.&#8221; Now, I don&#8217;t want to be presumptuous and try to interpret what the
Savior was thinking, but I can speak as a father of 6 children that it is a wonderful blessing to
have peacemakers in the family unit. On the other hand, I can testify that it only takes one
contentious person in an apartment of roommates, a family unit, a marriage, a ward, a community
gathering, or any other place where a group of people are working closely together to accomplish
a task or are just socially enjoying time together, to spoil the spirit of the occasion. With one
contenious person, very quickly dissension and ill will can replace the spirit of joy, cooperation,
and good will. When the spirit of contention enters a gathering it is amazing how quickly
productivity and good will can stop and an uncomfortable feeling can permeate the entire
gathering.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why that is so? The Savior explained the reason very clearly in 3 Nephi
11:29-30:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me,
but is of the devil,  who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of
men to contend with anger, one with another.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one
against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.</i></p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t leave any doubt in my mind where the source of contention comes from. Satan tries
so hard to spoil the spirit of love, unity, cooperation, and forgiveness in marriages, homes, wards,
and stakes, and in other places where we can lift one another up, support each other in our
struggles, and foster a spirit of unity and peace. Let us recognize the source of contention and
derision in our lives and as the Savior said, &#8220;such things should be done away.&#8221; Satan desires that
all of us become miserable like unto himself. Everything he does is to create a spirit of hatred,
contention, deception, defeat, misery, and despair. Recognize the source of such things whenever
they appear in your life and seek to avoid them and replace them with the things of the spirit.
Those things that come from the teachings and examples of the Savior.</p>
<p>In the Thirteenth Article of Faith the Prophet Joseph Smith stated,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>...If there is anything virtuous, lovely or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek
after these things.</i></p>
<p>Everything the Savior taught and did in his ministry was virtuous, lovely, of good report and
praisworthy. He dedicated his ministry to helping us find joy and peace and fulfillment. His
concern for us to be kind, loving, forgiving and peacemakers did not seem to me to be a passing
comment or an occasional act. It seems that it was a central concern in his teaching and in his
actions. If you read the entire sermon on the Mount in Matthew chapters 5, 6, and 7, his emphasis
on our relationships with our fellow beings seems to be a major part of his focus.</p>
<p>When he appeared on this continent, after his crucifiction and resurrection, he was introduced to
the people by His Father in 3 Nephi 11:7:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold My Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my
name- hear ye Him.</i></p>
<p>The Savior then descended from heaven and declared himself. He showed them the prints of the
nails in his hands and feet and allowed them to thrust their hands into his side. Next he
acknowledged the Prophet Nephi and gave him, along with others, the power to baptize the
people and told them the procedure they should follow in the baptismal ordinance.</p>
<p>The very next thing he did was to correct them about having disputations among themselves
concerning their method of baptism and concerning contentions over points of his doctrine as
there had previously been. Then comes his declaration in<sup> </sup>3 Nephi 11:29 and 30 that I have
previously referred to but it will be good for us to hear it again.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me,
but is of the devil,  who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of
men to contend with anger, one with another.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one
against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.</i></p>
<p>I hope this important scripture will be indelibly placed in your mind and that you will remember
it often.</p>
<p>In the next chapter he declares the place of the peacemakers as being called the children of God
and then gives them His discourse similar to the Sermon On The Mount to the Nephites. Again
as in the Holy Land, His teachings transcend the law of Moses with a higher law of love,
forgiveness, peace, and good will toward all men.</p>
<p>Is our attitude and treatment toward our fellow beings an important priority to the Savior? Let&#8217;s
look very briefly at a few events in the Savior&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>He began his ministry on both continents by declaring; turn the other cheek, if a man compels
you to go a mile with him, go two. If someone sues you and takes your coat, give him your cloak
also. Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you and despitefully use you(Matthew 5). 
He ends his ministry by washing his apostles feet then telling them to love one another as he has
loved them, which will identify them to the world as his disciples (John 13:34-35).</p>
<p>He then retires to the Garden of Gethsemane where he offers His great intercessory prayer and in
that prayer pleads with His Father that there may be unity and love among his disciples as He and
His Father have been one and have love one for another (John 17:21-26).</p>
<p>Then as he was apprehended by the guards and one of the Savior&#8217;s followers smote off the ear of
the servant of the high priest, the Savior healed the ear. (Luke 22:50-51) Then reproving his
brethren and making an important point about all that was going to happen, he makes this
statement:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me
more than twelve legions of angels?</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? </i>(Matthew
26:53-5)</p>
<p>Then, alone, without armies or legions of angels to defend Him, He met his awful fate and was
mocked, scourged, spit upon, tortured and hung on a cross to die, not for what He did but for all
of mankind. Then He placed the final exclamation mark on all that he had said and exemplified
throughout his ministry about avoiding contention, being more loving, patient and forgiving
when as he hung on the cross in one of the cruelest possible displays of man&#8217;s inhumanity to
man, this sinless, lamb of God, the Redeemer of all mankind declared</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>...Father forgive them for they know not what they do. And they parted his
raimant, and cast</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>lots</i>  (Luke 23:34).</p>
<p>The soldiers gambled for the only worldly possession he had left, his robe.</p>
<p>It is my humble prayer that we will show our love and appreciated to the Prince of Peace for all
that he has done for each of us individually by following his admonitions and example and doing
away with contention, selfishness, intolerance, hatred, bitterness, and all other unChrist-like
behavior toward our fellow beings.</p>
<p>We all know it is much easier to talk about these things than it is to live them. However, line
upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little each day we can endeavor to be a
little more like Him.</p>
<p>Maybe we ought to let a few songs go through our mind each day that would serve as reminders
of how He wants us to live. For starters how about, &#8220;I&#8217;m Trying To Be Like Jesus&#8221;, or &#8220;Let There
Be Peace On Earth and Let It Begin With Me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I like to remind myself often of the little saying,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I am only one</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But I am one.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I cannot do everything</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But I can do something</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And that which I can do</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>By the grace of God I shall do.</i></p>
<p>May God grant each of us the wisdom to remember who we are and who our examplar is and the
courage to go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded us to do and did himself.
Remember as he told his apostles,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them (John 13:17).</i></p>
<p>I had already written this talk before General Conference but I was extremely interested in
President Hinckley&#8217;s final remarks at the closing session of the last session. In case you do
remember them, let me remind you of what he said.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I pray that each of us will be a little more kind, a little more thoughtful, a little
more courteous. I pray that we will keep our tongues in check and not let anger
prompt words which we would later regret. I pray that we may have the strength
and the will to turn the other cheek, to walk the extra mile in lifting up the feeble
knees of those in distress</i> (President Gordon B. Hinckley, October Conference
2003). </p>
<p>As I listened to the Prophet&#8217;s council, I thought to myself, it is nice to be in tune with the desires
of the Prophet. It was also nice of him to make this statement so I could use it as the capstone for
my talk. Now I hope all of us can have the courage to follow the council we have been given by
our Prophet. </p>
<p>Of all these things I testify in the Holy name of our loving Savior even Jesus Christ, 
amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>October may be my favorite month.  Besides being the month of my dear wife&#8217;s birthday&#8211; an
event we enjoy celebrating all month&#8211; it is just a wonderful time of year in its own right.  The air
is crisp and clear.  The sky is as blue as azure.  The leaves are a burnished gold and a crimson
red.  It is as though Mother Nature did not want us to miss the fact that this is a special
season&#8212;the season of the harvest.  This is the season for gathering in the fruit of the seed sowed
earlier. This is the season for laying up in store against the inevitable chill of winter.  It is as
though nature is telling us that October is the season for celebrating the planting decisions wisely
made in the springtime of life.</p>
<p>Scripture tells us:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that
which is planted</i> (Ecclesiastes 3:1).</p>
<p>What is true in nature is true in life.  Life comes with its springtime, blandishing  us with the
promise of opportunity.  It heralds its ending with its autumn and its harvest, the fulfillment of
promise and the reward of the glow of a life well-lived.  As with fields of waving grain, the
bounty of life&#8217;s harvest turns largely on the industry and care of springtime&#8217;s planting.  As we
sow, so shall we reap.  Just as there is a proper time for harvesting, so there is a proper time for
planting.  This simple principle is sometimes called the Law of the Harvest.  </p>
<p>But I prefer a different- and to me, more descriptive- name.  I prefer to call this principle the Law
of the Seasons. Seasons come and stay for awhile; and then they pass on.  But, unlike the annual
renewal of seasons, life&#8217;s seasons come but once.  Youth -the flowering of life- is here for a
comparatively brief moment  and then all-to-soon it is gone, never to return.  While each
succeeding season of life brings its own joys and satisfactions, as well as its challenges, no other
time of life is quite as filled with promise as is youth.  Indeed, the joy and fulfillment of
succeeding seasons depends in significant measure upon the seizing of youth&#8217;s fleeting
opportunity.</p>
<p>But sometimes, as one cynic remarked, &#8220;Youth is wasted on the young.&#8221;  One of the faults
afflicting some of those in life&#8217;s springtime is a failure to recognize- and catch- the singular
moment for making critical decisions that youth presents.  Some years ago, a national news
magazine ran a feature on today&#8217;s young adult culture.  The article was entitled, &#8220;Young Beyond
their Years.&#8221;  The theme of the article is captured in these few sentences:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Something happened on the way to the twenty-first century; American youth, in a
sharp reversal of historical trends, are taking longer to grow up... [M]ore young
Americans are enrolled in college but fewer are graduating&#8212;and they are taking
longer to get their degrees.  They take longer to establish careers, too, and longer
yet to marry.  Many, unable or unwilling to pay for housing, return to the nest&#8212;or
are slow to leave it.  They postpone choices and spurn long-term commitments. 
Life&#8217;s on hold; adulthood can wait. . . .  To be sure, most young Americans still
expect to marry and have children.  But unlike their parents, the prospect fills
them with dread.  They have grown accustomed to keeping their options open. 
There are so many choices to make&#8212;in relationships, careers and consumer
goods&#8212;that they hate to limit their freedom.  They sense that marriage requires
compromise, negotiation and discipline&#8212;habits the youth culture does not enjoy
</i>(<i>Newsweek</i> magazine, 1990).</p>
<p>Although the writer of this article was attempting to describe the general young adult culture of
America, I must tell you, my young friends, that in my opinion his statement applies to some of
our Latter-day Saint Young Adults.  For them, the term &#8220;senior adolescents&#8221; may be more
descriptive than the term &#8220;young adults.&#8221;  While by no means general, this phenomenon is
common enough that it behooves everyone to take a personal inventory.  Even the young Prophet
Joseph Smith&#8212;a youth of sober mind but spirited disposition&#8212;took this personal inventory and
lamented what he saw.  In recalling his youth, said he:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">...<i>I was guilty of levity, and sometimes associated with jovial company, etc .,not
consistent with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was
called of God as I had been. . . .  In consequence of these things, I often felt
condemned for my weakness and imperfections </i>(Joseph Smith - History 1:28-29).</p>
<p>If not exactly &#8220;young beyond his years&#8221;, the young prophet nonetheless wrestled with being
young beyond his calling and the Lord&#8217;s expectations.    The Apostle Paul wrote: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but
when I became a man, I put away childish things </i>(1 Corinthians 13:11).</p>
<p>Joseph, too, became a man; but as he viewed in retrospect the experience of doing so he
concluded that he should have done it sooner.</p>
<p>I vividly learned that same lesson.  When I graduated from college, I was commissioned an
officer in the United States Army.  I was an infantryman.  After completing some training, in
early 1965 I was assigned&#8211; with my bride of a few months&#8211; to an infantry battalion of the 25<sup>th</sup>
U.S. Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii.  My wife and I were thrilled with this
assignment and looked forward to three years of life amidst the sun and the surf and the
wonderful people of Hawaii.  We rented a little duplex right on the beach on the North Shore of
Oahu.  You could step out of our back door onto the sand; it was literally like something out of a
movie. </p>
<p>In October of that year, our battalion received a new commander, Lt. Col. Thomas U. Greer&#8211;
&#8220;Tug&#8221; Greer, as his peers called him.  Tug Greer was a graduate of the United States Military
Academy at West Point, Class of 1951.  In 1951, the Korean War was raging.  Most of the West
Point class that  year was assigned immediately to the combat zone.  Many of Tug Greer&#8217;s
classmates died on the rugged slopes of that land.  But Tug had survived and remained in the
army.  And now, 14 years later, he was assigned to command our battalion.</p>
<p>No sooner did he assume command, than Col. Greer took the battalion on a week-long training
exercise in the rugged Kahuku Mountains of northern Oahu.  For those of you who have not been
to Hawaii, let me describe these mountains.  They are steep slopes of volcanic rock with little
topsoil and covered with thick, green vegetation.  For five days, we struggled up and down those
slopes in one infantry maneuver after another.  Finally, it was Saturday morning, the last day of
the exercise.  All of us looked forward to returning early to our battalion headquarters, turning in
our equipment and hitting the beach.  After all, we were young, and what was the point of being
stationed in Hawaii if you could not go to the beach!   I remember gazing down early that
morning from my perch on the side of one of those mountains at the shimmering sand and
sparkling ocean.  I could hardly wait!</p>
<p>About that time, Col. Greer came to our rifle company&#8217;s position.  To our company commander,
Capt. Jim Andrus, he said, &#8220;As the last exercise of this training, I would like Charlie Company
(that was us&#8211; &#8220;C&#8221; Company) to establish defensive positions.  Now, among other things
establishing defensive positions meant digging foxholes.  You know what a foxhole is.  It is a
hole in the ground where a soldier can seek shelter from enemy fire.  But this was volcanic rock! 
And we were only equipped with those little folding shovels (which the army calls &#8220;entrenching
tools&#8221;)!  So, as Capt. Andrus gathered us platoon leaders around to give us the orders for
establishing defensive positions, he said, &#8220;Since we want to get this over with quickly, we won&#8217;t
actually dig foxholes.  Instead, we will simply do &#8220;simulated foxholes&#8221;&#8211; we will just mark out on
the ground where we would put the foxholes.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, that is what we did.  A little while later, Col. Greer came around to inspect our &#8220;defensive
positions&#8221;.  I remember it like it was yesterday!  As he came to the first of these &#8220;simulated
foxholes&#8221;, he asked Capt. Andrus, &#8220;What are those?&#8221;  Clearing his throat a little nervously, Capt.
Andrus responded, &#8220;Well, sir, those are simulated foxholes.&#8221;  &#8220;Simulated foxholes!!&#8221; roared Col.
Greer.  &#8220;I ordered this company to prepare defensive positions, and that means digging foxholes! 
This company is going to stay out here and dig until it learns how to dig foxholes that look like
the came out of the training manual!&#8221;  And so, as the rest of the battalion packed up weapons and
equipment and headed back to the base and an afternoon at the beach, Charlie Company
remained out on that hillside.  And we dug, and we dug, and we dug.  Col. Greer&#8217;s name was on
every one&#8217;s lips that afternoon, and I can tell you that he was not winning any popularity contests
that day!  But by evening, we had foxholes that really looked just like they came out of the
training manual.</p>
<p>But, you see, there was something that we did not know that beautiful Hawaiian Saturday.  When
Col. Greer had been given his orders assigning him as our battalion commander, he had also
received some other orders that he could not share with us&#8211; top secret orders&#8211; sending our
battalion to Vietnam.  We did not know it at the time, but this would be our last training exercise. 
And Col. Greer, with his vivid memories of his fallen classmates on the rugged hillsides of Korea
was determined to do all that he could to save the lives of those men entrusted to his care.  In a
manner of speaking, Hawaii was the &#8220;season&#8221; for learning those skills that would save our lives. 
Vietnam would be too late.</p>
<p>What happened next I did not personally observe, arriving in Vietnam a few days after the rest of
the battalion; but it was reported to me by my comrades-in-arms.  They reached the spot in the
division&#8217;s defensive perimeter assigned to our battalion late in an afternoon.  Col. Greer&#8217;s order
went out: Establish defensive positions.  Our men dug in because that is what you did in Tug
Greer&#8217;s battalion.  Another battalion next to ours, arriving at the same time, only scooped out
some shallow cavities in the ground&#8211; not unlike our Hawaiian &#8220;simulated foxholes&#8221;&#8211;  planning
to dig real foxholes the next day.  But that night, the Viet Cong enemy launched a ferocious
mortar barrage into the green troops.  Our men were safe and secure in their foxholes; but the
men of that neighboring battalion were not so fortunate.  I am told that the next morning Tug
Greer&#8217;s name was again on everyone&#8217;s lips&#8211; but this time with reverence and respect.  I still
regard him as one of the great men I have known.  From him I learned one of life&#8217;s most
powerful lessons: There is indeed a &#8220;time for every purpose under heaven&#8221;&#8211; even a time to learn
to dig foxholes.</p>
<p>Like most parables, the &#8220;Parable of the Foxholes&#8221; has multiple teachings.  But today I draw upon
it for just one of them.  The Parable of the Foxholes teaches the truth of the timeless maxim:
&#8220;When the time for performance is present, the time for preparation is past.&#8221;  While that teaching
is relevant to us all, it has particular application to you, my young friends, who are in life&#8217;s
springtime&#8211; nature&#8217;s season for planting and preparation.  And so I would like to ask each of
you&#8211; personally&#8211; three basic questions as though you were on the witness stand in a court of law. 
No one will know your answers except you and the Lord.  But then, you are the only two that
matter!  And you must answer truthfully for the simple reason that there is no concealing the
truth from either of you.  So it behooves you to answer each question with complete candor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Question #1: What are you doing to develop your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ? </span></p>
<p>The Apostle Paul defined faith as &#8220;<i>the substance [or assurance] of things hoped for, the evidence
of things not seen</i>&#8221; (Hebrews 11:1).  The Prophet Mormon referred to faith as &#8220;<i>a firm mind in
every form of godliness</i>&#8221; (Moroni 7:29).  The Fourth Article of Faith declares that the very first
principle of the gospel is &#8220;<i>faith in the Lord Jesus Christ</i>&#8221; (Article of Faith 4).  </p>
<p>So, what <span style="text-decoration: underline">do</span> you think of Christ?  Jesus asked that very question of the Pharisees: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>...what think ye of Christ? Whose son is he?  They say unto him, The Son of David.  He
saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord...If David then call him
Lord, how is he his son?  And no man was able to answer him a word...</i>(Matthew 22:42-46).</p>
<p>These faithless ones could not answer that simple, direct question.  But when Jesus asked
essentially the same question to his beloved and faith-filled disciples, he got a much different
answer:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,
saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?  And they said, Some say that
thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the
prophets.  He saith unto them,</i> But whom say <span style="text-decoration: underline">ye </span>that I am?  And Simon Peter
answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God<i>.  And Jesus
answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and
blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven </i>(Matthew
16:13-17, emphasis added).</p>
<p>So, I ask again, what are you doing to strengthen your faith in the Savior.  Are you earnestly
striving to keep His commandments and to obtain your witness by the Spirit, as did Peter;
or...not?</p>
<p>And while we are on the subject, what are you doing to develop your faith in the Prophet Joseph
Smith and in the Restoration?  Joseph said he did not know which church he should join; so,
acting in reliance on the promise of the Apostle James that one lacking wisdom could ask of God
with the expectation of an answer, Joseph said that as a fourteen year-old boy he went into a
grove of trees to pray and that in response to his prayer God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ,
appeared to him.  I ask you, do you believe that really happened?  You see, it either did or it
didn&#8217;t.  It didn&#8217;t &#8220;sort of&#8221; happen.  The Father and the Son either appeared to the boy Joseph...or
They did not.  None of us can equivocate in his soul in answering that question.  </p>
<p>Neither can we avoid it.  Almost the very first thing that the Angel Moroni told Joseph Smith
when he visited him in his bedroom on the night of September 21, 1823, was that Joseph&#8217;s name
&#8220;<i>should be had for good and evil among all nations</i>&#8221; (Joseph Smtih-History 1:33).  We are
witnessing that phenomenon in our own day.  Joseph Smith&#8217;s name is honored by some and
vilified by others.  You and I cannot hide in a corner and pretend that the question does not exist. 
It does exist, and each of us&#8211; like it or not&#8211; is compelled by circumstances to answer it.<span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>If Joseph&#8217;s declaration is true, it is the most important event since Jesus Himself came into this
world to take upon Himself the sins of the world.  If it isn&#8217;t true, then it&#8217;s all a big lie. <span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>I testify to you&#8211; with all the fervor of my soul&#8211; that Joseph&#8217;s declaration <span style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> true!!!  He <span style="text-decoration: underline">did</span> see the
Father.  He <span style="text-decoration: underline">did</span> see the Son.  And They <span style="text-decoration: underline">did</span> in reality speak to him.  And through him They
restored the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its fullness.  I testify to you that the Book of Mormon is
true and that this Church is true and that we are lead by a living prophet in President Gordon B.
Hinckley, who is the rightful successor in prophetic authority to Joseph Smith.  I testify all of this
to you as an &#8220;<i>especial witness</i>&#8221; of the Savior (Doctrine and Covenants 107:25). </p>
<p>But you cannot merely take my word for it.  Or anyone else&#8217;s word for it.  You must obtain your
own witness, and for each of us that is a very private matter.  But I testify to you that, just as
Peter knew of the divinity of Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit, so you&#8211;so each of us&#8211; can
know of the reality of Christ and of the divine appointment of the Prophet Joseph Smith...if you
will make the effort.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Now, Question #2: Do you partake worthily and thoughtfully of the sacrament?</span></p>
<p>I suppose that almost all of us in this devotional congregation have been baptized members of
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Baptism is intended as an expression of one&#8217;s
convictions&#8211; &#8220;<i>the first fruits of repentance</i>&#8221; is the way Mormon put it (Moroni 8:25).  It is an
outward expression of our repentance and represents a covenant with the Lord that we will strive
to live according to His commandments.  In return, He promises us the remission of sins and the
right to the continuing &#8220;<i>visitation of the Holy Ghost</i>&#8221; (Moroni 8:26).  </p>
<p>Now, next Sunday you will go to your ward sacrament meeting.  There, one holding the
priesthood of God will kneel before the emblems of the sacrament and, in exercise of his
priesthood authority and as a stand-in for the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Mediator between God
and man and our Advocate with the Father, will utter these words:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to
bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they
may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the
Eternal Father, that [1] they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son,
and [2] always remember him and [3] keep his commandments which he has
given them...</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Thus that priesthood holder, acting for Jesus Christ, promises on our behalf that we will keep the
covenants we made at the time of baptism&#8211; to take upon ourselves the name of our Savior and
always remember Him and keep his commandments.  Then, another priesthood holder, again
acting in place and stead of the Savior, presents the emblems of the sacrament to each of us; and
as we partake we ratify the covenants made on our behalf by the priest.</p>
<p>Then, speaking for the Lord, the priest makes a promise to each of us so partaking: &#8220;[T]hat [we]
may always have his Spirit to be with [us]&#8221; (id.).  Thus, the sacrament is the most sacred
ordinance in which we regularly participate.  As each thoughtfully and worthily renews those
baptismal covenants in the process of the sacrament service, each receives the Lord&#8217;s absolute
promise and assurance that no matter what we face in the days ahead, His spirit will be with us.</p>
<p>In our infantry battalion of some 500 men, there were three of us who were Latter-day Saints. 
Sundays in Vietnam usually found us somewhere in the jungle.  But we would find a few
moments to get together.  We would take some canned bread from our C-rations and a cup of
warm water from a canteen; one of us would bless these humble emblems and pass them to the
rest of us.  We would share our testimonies and have a prayer.  Then, we would pick up our rifles
and return to our duties.  My dear brothers and sisters, I testify to you that never in any of our
beautiful chapels have I felt the Spirit of the Lord more profoundly than I did in those simple
jungle sacrament services.  Those words: &#8220;[T]that they may always have his Spirit to be with
them&#8221; took on a literal meaning that they have never lost.</p>
<p>You will recall that it was the Savior Himself who introduced the ordinance of the sacrament,
both among His Old World disciples (at the Last Supper) and among His New World disciples
when He visited here in His resurrected state.  Nephi&#8217;s record of the latter event is particularly
significant.  It says that when His disciples partook of the emblems, &#8220;they were filled&#8221;.  Filled
with what, one might ask?  The answer, of course, is &#8220;filled with the Spirit&#8221;.  I ask each of you:
When you partake of the sacrament, are you also filled?  You can be, provided that you worthily
and thoughtfully partake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">Finally, Question #3: Have you firmly planted your feet on a course leading to a career
path that will bring financial security and personal reward?</span></p>
<p>Now, many of you are just beginning your higher education.  Don&#8217;t panic if you haven&#8217;t selected
a major yet, much less decided upon a career!!  Perhaps the more pertinent question for you is,
how serious are you about finding your major?  Are you sincerely asking yourself, &#8220;What do I
want to be when I grow up?&#8221; or are you just sleep-walking through your academic program on
your way to a good time.</p>
<p>Finding your life&#8217;s work is very much a process of following ever-narrowing paths.  You start out
as a freshman on a broad curriculum &#8220;highway&#8221;.  Then, as you experiment with a variety of
courses, your &#8220;road&#8221; steadily narrows until you eventually find yourself on a &#8220;straight and narrow
path&#8221; of your eventual career.  Sometimes, if you are really serious about your quest, you may
find yourself on a path you never would have imagined.  When I was your age, I attended a large
university in California.  A friend of mine played end on the football team&#8211; in fact, he was all
Pac Ten.  He started out thinking that physical education was where he belonged.  But, as do
virtually all undergraduate institutions (including this one!), he was required to take a variety of
courses, including a course in the biological sciences.  Looking through the course catalogue, he
ran across an introductory course in &#8220;entomology&#8221;&#8211; the study of insects.  That piqued his
curiosity, so he enrolled.  It was a decision that catapulted him in a direction he never would have
thought.  Entomology became his major.  Ultimately, he earned a doctorate in the subject and
became a university professor.</p>
<p>Who can say what adventures lie ahead for <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> in a volume as seemingly mundane as the course
catalogue?!  But you have to take it seriously.  And now&#8211; right now&#8211; is the season for doing so. 
You have earned a place in a very select institution.  Did you know that the Church university&#8211;
BYU&#8211; is able to accept a mere handful of the graduating Latter-day Saint high school students
each year?  That means that for each one of you, there are many others who are not able to be
here.    For the most part, these are the sons and daughters of faithful, tithe-paying fathers and
mothers whose tithing dollars are contributing substantially to <span style="text-decoration: underline">your</span> education instead of their
own children&#8217;s. In a manner of speaking, my friends, you have rented the Hilton.  And each of
you owes it to yourself&#8211;  and to all those others who would like to have had your seat&#8211;  to make
the most of this opportunity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Now</span> is the season for choosing and preparing for your life&#8217;s work.  It is okay if you as yet don&#8217;t
know what you want to do, provided that you are &#8220;anxiously engaged&#8221; in the &#8220;good cause&#8221; of
finding out!  There is an old saying that &#8220;you don&#8217;t know what you have &#8216;til it&#8217;s gone&#8221;.  The
Vietnam War interrupted my educational plans.  What I thought would be a three-year experience
in the Army stretched into five years, including two tours of duty in the combat zone.  I wanted to
become a lawyer.  But at times I despaired that I might never see my home again, much less
continue with my educational plans.  And so, when at last I was able to resign from the Army and
enroll in law school, I was ecstatic.  I still remember the joy I felt just going to the student book
store to purchase my law books for that first semester.  Literally, it was like Christmas!  That
sense of gratitude for the <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>opportunity</i></span> of just being there colored my entire law school
experience.  </p>
<p>And I guess that is my message to you today&#8211; Opportunity!</p>
<p>I cannot reflect on the priceless value of this season&#8217;s opportunity without thinking about the Hoa
family.  The year 1975 was grim in Vietnam.  The Republic of Vietnam had collapsed in the face
of the relentless onslaught of the North Vietnamese.  The army had surrendered.  The
government had capitulated.  Those who had been strongly identified with the government of
South Vietnam or with the Americans feared for their lives and well-being.  Many fled the
country.  Those who could not force their way onto departing military aircraft took passage on
overcrowded ships and boats of every description.  Some of these rusting hulks sprang leaks and
sank in the South China Sea, not far into the voyage.  Others were accosted by pirates, who
molested and murdered many of these pathetic refugees and stole what few possessions they had
brought with them.  Tran Do Hoa, his wife Nga, their two young daughters and Nga&#8217;s teenage
brother were among those who survived these perils and eventually reached the United States
under an amnesty program.</p>
<p>Our ward in Southern California had offered to sponsor one such family.  We found and rented a
small home and furnished it in &#8220;early Deseret Industries&#8221;decor.  Finally, the day came that we
were to meet &#8220;our&#8221; family.  With my young son as company, I drove to Camp Pendleton, the
sprawling U.S. Marine Corps base in northern San Diego County, to pick them up.  Following
directions, we turned off the main highway onto a narrow byway that soon became a dirt road. 
We drove down this road for a considerable distance until we came to a large encampment of
tents in an isolated part of the base.  This was where these refugees were housed.  The sight was
heartrending: hundreds of Vietnamese attired in worn and ill-fitting clothing, many malnourished
and still showing the bone-deep exhaustion of their ordeal.  Clouds of dust hung in the late-summer air from the foot and vehicular traffic in and about the camp.</p>
<p>It was then, after checking in at the administrative tent, that I got my first glimpse of Hoa.  He
was a distinguished looking man in his early forties, thin to the point of emaciation, with graying
hair and a gentle, polite smile.  Nga, his wife, was a tiny woman with the natural beauty and
graciousness of the Vietnamese.  Two little girls, Betty and Ti (&#8220;Tee&#8221;), each clutching a doll,
shyly clung to their parents.  Thuan, Nga&#8217;s teenage brother, stood awkwardly nearby.  And what I
remember the most: all of their belongings were in a small, travel-worn suitcase and a cheap,
plastic shopping bag.  In Vietnam, Hoa had been a government civil servant; Nga had worked as
a secretary.  They had enjoyed a modest, but comfortable, standard of living.  Now they had
nothing.  In fleeing Vietnam, they had forsaken everything they owned and held dear.  Grateful to
have escaped with their lives, they were totally and completely destitute in a strange land far
from home.  Hoa spoke halting English; Nga and the children spoke almost no English.  As we
drove out of that dusty encampment and onto Interstate 5, the great coastal superhighway, I
remember thinking how overwhelmed and alone they must feel.</p>
<p>Looking back now, however, with the perspective of the years, I realize that Hoa and Nga had
something not immediately apparent to the eye.  They had a profound sense of gratitude for the
<i>opportunity</i> that this land afforded them.  They had virtually nothing of this world&#8217;s goods when
they arrived in this country.  But they brought with them a fierce determination to seize the
<i>opportunity</i> provided.   Through some interviews we helped to arrange, Hoa found work in a
small electronics company.  Nga immediately began attending English classes and eventually
found a clerical job.  Betty and Thuan enrolled in school and devoted themselves to their studies
with single-minded resolve.  Little Ti, a pre-schooler when the family arrived, grew up as an
American child but fueled with the same work ethic that animated the other members of her
family.</p>
<p>In time, our family moved away.  We lost contact with Hoa and Nga and their children for a
period of years.  And so it was, with considerable delight, that we discovered on a return visit to
that community that Hoa and Nga had purchased a lovely home.  Two late-model automobiles
were parked in their garage.  Hoa and Nga each held responsible, remunerative jobs.  Thuan had
completed college as an electrical engineer.  Betty had a scholarship to attend UCLA.  And Ti
was a vivacious teenager.  Not long afterward, Hoa passed away prematurely.</p>
<p>More years passed.  I was serving in the Area Presidency of the North America West Area and
was assigned to a stake conference near Riverside, California.  As I walked into the chapel on
Sunday morning, there on the first row was Thuan.  Although not a Church member and living
more than 50 miles from this stake center, he had heard of my coming to the conference quite by
chance from a workmate who was a member of the stake.  He had come to once again express his
gratitude-- and that of his family-- for the blessing of an <i>opportunity</i>.  It was a wonderful and
tearful reunion for me&#8211;one I shall always remember.</p>
<p>As I look at you and me, bathed as we are in relative affluence, and all too often nonchalant about
the <i>opportunity</i> cascading about us, I see in my mind&#8217;s eye a dusty encampment shimmering in
the summer heat and a little family far from home, strangers in a strange land, with a worn
suitcase and a plastic shopping bag.  The vision restores my perspective.</p>
<p>My dear young friends, <i>carpe diem</i>!  Seize this day!  Grasp the marvelous <i>opportunity</i> that this
springtime season of your life affords!  It may be October outside, but in terms of the <i>opportunity</i>
within your grasp it is April.  But April will not last forever.  October and its harvest-- with the
portent of winter&#8217;s snows-- will come soon enough for you as it does for each of us.  May your
harvest at that day be rich and full and rewarding.</p>
<p>It all depends on how you use this springtime.  That is the Law of the Seasons.  My prayer for
you is that you will remember the Parable of the Foxholes.  This season is <span style="text-decoration: underline">your</span> season. Seize it! 
<i>Carpe diem</i>!</p>

<p>One of the joys of teaching in the Church Educational System is to be associated with so many
students who are in the season of their lives when they decide to serve church missions, fall in
love, and are prepared and worthy to be sealed to each other for time and all eternity.  A personal
highlight for me was also the opportunity I had to serve as Bishop of a BYU singles ward where I
could be part of this preparation process for temple marriage.  One of the members of that ward
was Eric Bednar, son of President and Sister Bednar.  I cherish my association with Eric and all
of the members of the BYU 178<sup>th</sup> Ward.</p>
<p>During my time as Bishop, I attended many weddings and receptions, but one stands out in my
mind.  My wife and I attended a sealing in the Salt Lake Temple for a couple from our ward that
was attended by only a few people.  The groom&#8217;s parents were from a less active family, but he
had a supportive returned missionary sister who also lived in our ward.  The bride was the only
member of her family in the church.  </p>
<p>The family of the bride was opposed to marriage before their daughter graduated from college,
something that would not happen for more than a year. With the permission of the bride, I
offered to call her parents and discuss with them why our faith encourages marriage when the
partners are prepared and committed as this couple was. I approached this phone call prayerfully
and humbly, hoping that the spirit would soften the hearts of the parents.  In my phone call I
praised the moral character of their daughter and the young man she loved.  I explained that our
standards are different from the worlds and praised the couple&#8217;s commitment to abstain from
sexual intimacy before marriage.  I further told the parents that couples who marry in the temple
must uphold high standards of personal and moral integrity and that a temple marriage is seen as
a binding commitment with profound religious significance. I also said that as a professor I value
education and knew that their daughter and her fianc&eacute; were both committed to her finishing her
degree. The parents left the decision about pursuing marriage up to their daughter, but were not
encouraging or supportive. </p>
<p>Even without strong family support, this young couple made the correct choice and were married
in the right place and at the right time. The spirit was so strong in the sealing room that morning. 
There was a feeling of joy in the room.  Now, years later, the couple is happily married, the wife
completed her degree and they are expecting a child in a few months. Today I want to talk to you
about the importance of a commitment to marriage and family, even in the face of growing
opposition.  Few of us have the kind of direct opposition this couple faced, but marriage and
family are under attack and all of us need to be prepared to defend marriage and family. </p>
<p>Family has long been seen as the primary teaching and socializing agent for children.  Even
though some in the academy dispute the role of parents, the conventional view remains that <i>&#8220;the
effects of parenting are likely to become large effects over time.&#8221;</i>&nbsp;

  In a recent summary of the
psychology literature, the authors state<i>: &#8220;specific parental influences, consistently experienced,
likely accumulate to produce larger meaningful outcomes over the childhood and adolescent
years.&#8221;</i>&nbsp;
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

</script>
  You noticed the use of modifiers in that sentence, that is the way academics write for
each other.  If we ask young adults rather than adolescents, we find much greater similarity to
parents in values and behaviors.&nbsp;

  A lot of things your parents said or expected of you as
teenagers will make more sense to you when you are parents yourselves. </p>
<p>Former prime minister of Great Britain, Margaret Thatcher, summarized the powerful role of
family when she said: <i>&#8220;The family is the building block of society.  It is a nursery, a school, a
hospital, a leisure center, a place of refuge and a place of rest.  It encompasses the whole of
society.  It fashions our beliefs; it is the preparation for the rest of our life.&#8221;</i>

  }
</script>
</p>
<p>In my own field of political science we know that the family is central to our core values.</p>
<p>Freed Greenstein, in his landmark book, <i>Children and Politics</i>, said <i>&#8220;The most important source
of children&#8217;s conceptions of authority undoubtedly is the civic instruction which goes on
incidental to normal activities in the family.&#8221;</i>&nbsp;
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
  In the family we acquire our sense of freedom,
democracy, and patriotism.  </p>
<p>A good friend of mine once hosted  to Sunday dinner a prominent national journalist who is not
LDS.  As was traditional, the father went around the dinner table asking each of the children
what they had learned in Church that Sunday.  I suspect this might be a tradition in your homes
as well.  For this journalist this was a remarkable experience.  To hear children as young as three
or four years of age, teenagers, and parents share the lessons they learned and to observe the
family interaction was for this journalist, an example of how LDS families build faith and
relationships. He is correct in that perception.</p>
<p>Our church leaders also see the family as central.  President Boyd K. Packer said, <i>&#8220;Nothing is
more important to the church and to civilization than the family.&#8221; </i>
&nbsp;<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>Family has a transcendent
importance.  Elder Russell M. Nelson said, <i>&#8220;with the Lord, families are essential.  He created
the earth that we could gain physical bodies and form families. He established His Church to
exalt families.  He provides temples so that families can be together forever.&#8221;</i>&nbsp;
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '&lt;span id="WPEndnote7" class="WPFloatStyle"&gt;' );
    document.write( WPEndnote7 );
    document.write( '&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPEndnote7\')"&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;' );
    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>Evidence of the importance of the family to our time is the fact that the First Presidency and
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued &#8220;The Family: A Proclamation to the World.&#8221;  This
proclamation, one of only five such pronouncements since the gospel was restored, was given by
President Gordon B. Hinckley at the General Relief Society Meeting in 1995.  President
Hinckley prefaced his reading of the proclamation with some alarming statistics about children
born out of wedlock and the consequences for society of the breakdown of the family in terms of
welfare and other costs.  He also said, <i>&#8220;With so much sophistry that is passed off as truth, with so
much of deception concerning standards and values, with so much allurement and enticement to
take on the slow stain of the world, we have felt to warn and forewarn.&#8221;</i>&nbsp;
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '&lt;span id="WPEndnote8" class="WPFloatStyle"&gt;' );
    document.write( WPEndnote8 );
    document.write( '&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPEndnote8\')"&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;' );
    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>The Proclamation uses strong language, words like: &#8220;solemnly proclaim,&#8221; &#8220;declare,&#8221; &#8220;affirm,&#8221;
&#8220;warn,&#8221; &#8220;call upon.&#8221;  Some important elements of the proclamation are that &#8220;marriage between a
man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator&#8217;s plan for the
eternal destiny of His children.&#8221;  &#8220;Divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be
perpetuated beyond the grave.&#8221;  &#8220;We declare that God&#8217;s commandment for His children to
multiply and replenish the earth remains in force.  We further declare that God has commanded
that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully
wedded as husband and wife.&#8221;  &#8220;Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care
for each other and for their children.&#8221;  &#8220;Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved
when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;  &#8220;In these sacred responsibilities,
fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have not read the proclamation recently or don&#8217;t have a copy, I urge you to get one and
carefully read it.  A close friend of mine, Tim Flanigan, served until recently as Deputy Counsel
to President George W. Bush.  When I visited Tim in his office in the West Wing of the White
House I observed a framed copy of the proclamation hanging on his wall.   What a wonderful
statement about his values.  But an even more powerful statement is the kind of parents Tim and

<p>Commenting on the title of the proclamation, Elder Henry B. Eyring has observed,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i> Three things about the title are worth our careful reflection.  First the subject:
the family.  Second, the audience, which is the whole world.  And third, those
proclaiming it are those we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators.  All this
means that the family must be of tremendous importance to us, that whatever the
proclamation says could help anyone in the world, and that the proclamation fits
the Lord&#8217;s promise when he said, &#8216;Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of
the servants, it is the same.&#8217;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants 1:38).&nbsp;

<p>Because of the central importance of the family, it makes sense that Satan would  attack marriage
and family. Book of Mormon Prophet Nephi commented on the last days and made some
remarkable predictions:<i> &#8220;For behold, at that day shall he [Satan] rage in the hearts of the
children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good,&#8221; </i>Nephi continues <i>&#8220;And
thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.&#8221;</i>&nbsp;

  Elder
Russell M. Nelson helps us understand the purposes of the adversary when he says, &#8220;Because the
work (and glory) of God is to bring to pass our immortality and eternal life as a family, it
logically follows that the work of the adversary will strike directly at the heart of the home&#8211;the
family.  Relentlessly Lucifer attacks the sanctity of life and the joy of parenthood.&#8221;&nbsp;

<p>The adversary works to undermine marriage and family in a variety of ways, but often indirectly. 
As Elder Ballard said in his recent conference address, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>When Satan wants to disrupt the work of the Lord, he doesn&#8217;t poison the world&#8217;s
peanut butter supply, thus bringing the Church&#8217;s missionary system to its
collective knees.  He doesn&#8217;t send a plague of laryngitis to afflict the Mormon
Tabernacle Choir.  He doesn&#8217;t legislate against green Jell-O or casseroles.  When
Satan truly wants to disrupt the work of the Lord, he attempts to confuse gender
and attacks God&#8217;s plan for His spirit children... Satan knows that the surest and
most effective way to disrupt the Lord&#8217;s work is to diminish the effectiveness of the
family and the sanctity of home.</i>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>One of the primary tools of the adversary against the family has been the media.  Adultery,
fornication and homosexuality are now commonplace on prime time television.  The Kaiser
Family Foundation has found that as much as three-quarters of prime time television programs
have sexual content.&nbsp;

  Each week, millions of Americans tune into programs that mock and
trivialize sacred marital bonds, while promoting the concept of cohabitation.  These programs
over time have a way of desensitizing our moral thinking, making what is wrong appear normal
or acceptable.  In social science we talk about media sources and peer groups as establishing a
reference point or reference group which orients our behavior.  Lets not let the media become our
reference group.  The best way to avoid the slippery slope of the media mocking the sacred is to
simply avoid all programing inconsistent with our values and urge others we love to do the same.</p>
<p>Sadly, many have accepted this false notion of &#8220;trying out a relationship&#8221; before really
committing to marriage.  A majority of all U.S. marriages today involve cohabitation before the
wedding. Between 1974 and 1994 the percentage of marriages preceded by cohabitation rose
form 10 percent to 56 percent.  Nearly 60 percent of high school seniors indicate agreement with
the statement that &#8220;it is usually a good idea for a couple to live together before getting married in
order to find out whether they really get along.&#8221;&nbsp;
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>The truth about cohabitation is quite different than that depicted on television, in movies, or the
internet.  Researchers have found that </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>cohabiting couples experience greater conflict, lower quality of relationships,
lower stability, and lower equality for the women involved.  Domestic violence is
far more common among couples living together than those who are married,
leading one analyst to note that the phrase &#8216;wife beating&#8217; is a misnomer.  A more
precise term would be &#8216;girlfriend beating.&#8217;</i>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Is some of the world&#8217;s thinking creeping into our thinking?  Does the fear of commitment scare
us away from the idea of searching for a potential marriage partner?  I sense a growing tendency,
especially among LDS returned missionary males to postpone dating or a serious exploration for
a possible marriage partner.  Maybe it is out of concern to finish school,  or maybe our difficult
economic times make it hard to imagine entering into marriage, or maybe these eligibles fear
making a mistake in what they know to be one of the most important decisions they will ever
make.  But we have been told over and over that it is important to be anxiously engaged in
seeking a marriage partner.  When both a man and a woman have had a spiritual confirmation
that they should be married, they should do so.  President Hinckley encourages all young adults
to seek such confirmations and act accordingly.  He said, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>To our young adults of marriageable circumstances, I hope you will not put off
marriage too long.  I do not speak so much to the young women as to the young
men whose prerogative and responsibility it is to take the lead in this matter. 
Don&#8217;t go on endlessly in a frivolous dating game.  Look for a choice companion,
one you can love, honor, and respect, and make a decision.</i>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Might the adversary be influencing us in other ways?  Do we doubt that people can be really
committed to each other enough to make marriage work?   Sometimes people perceive
themselves to be unfit for marriage if they don&#8217;t come from an &#8220;ideal&#8221; LDS family.  You have
the power to create a new pattern for your marriage and the family you form.  I know, I have seen
this happen in my own family.  </p>
<p>If you have these concerns, please  listen carefully to what Prophets and Apostles have told us. 
Make their counsel a matter of personal prayer and then respond to the prompting of the spirit.  
Elder O. Leslie Stone states that marriage offers many<i> &#8220;opportunities for growth and
development.  As we meet the challenges successfully, we will enjoy peace, love, and tranquility
in our marriage and in our home.&#8221;</i>&nbsp;

  Marriage, like all other aspects of our Heavenly Father&#8217;s
plan of happiness, allows us to learn and grow, to progress.  The critical thing is what kind of
relationship do we want and are we willing to pursue this eternal relationship in the Lord&#8217;s way,
with real commitment for time and all eternity.  If you and I are committed to that, I am confident
we can create the kind of family and home we want.  Marriage and family are powerful change
agents, a power only amplified when we have the blessings of eternal covenants with our
Heavenly Father. </p>
<p>As President Hinckley mentioned when he read the proclamation, there is much of sophistry
about marriage and family in the world.  The myth of cohabitation being beneficial is only one of
the lies and deceptions surrounding marriage and family that we confront today.  Others are that
marriages don&#8217;t or cannot last; that marriage is merely a social construct and can be redefined to
permit same sex couples; that career and reputation brings more satisfaction than children and
family.  Some see marriage as outmoded and unnecessary, others say divorce is liberating, or
even that parents are irrelevant.  The list could go on and on.   Do you see a pattern here?  What
is the common theme of these messages&#8211;hopelessness, self-centeredness, living in violation of
longstanding commandments.</p>
<p>Marriages can last and relationships continue to grow for years and years.  Last April, President
and Sister Hinckley celebrated their 66<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary.  President Hinckley has said of
Sister Hinckley,<i> </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>She has been the lodestar of their lives, and they all look back to her as the source
of inspiration and the one to have a happy time with.  They love her, she loves
them... I love this dear companion of mine. . . .  To her, I give all the credit for the
virtues of our family, including our children and our grandchildren and our
great-grandchildren. </i>

  }

</p>
<p>Sister Hinckley has said of President Hinckley, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>He never insisted that I do anything his way, or any way, for that matter.  From
the very beginning he gave me space and let me fly.</i>

  }
</script>
</p>
<p>What a wonderful example President and Sister Hinckley are to all of us. </p>
<p>Contrary to the myths of the adversary, marriage is good for us.  Marriage and family scholarship
shows that </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>a lasting marriage proves to be more beneficial physically, mentally,
economically, even sexually than exercise programs, medical treatments,
financial investments, or therapy sessions.  The research even shows why
marriage contributes to so many facets of adult well-being and, perhaps most
helpful, pinpoints qualities common to couples whose marriages have
lasted&#8211;qualities even fallible humans are capable of achieving. </i>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )

    document.write( '&lt;span id="WPEndnote20" class="WPFloatStyle"&gt;' );
    document.write( WPEndnote20 );
    document.write( '&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPEndnote20\')"&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;' );
    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>What can you do to strengthen marriage and family?  One thing is be a good example and don&#8217;t
apologize for valuing marriage and family.  In my first teaching job at a university back East
some colleagues routinely teased me about being married and especially having multiple
children.  I tried to take the teasing in stride.  Then, years later after taking a position at BYU,
one of those who used to ridicule me, called.  He said that he had fallen in love and was thinking
of getting married.  I told him that I thought marriage was a wonderful institution and that he
should take the leap.  He said, &#8220;you don&#8217;t understand, she will want children.&#8221;  I said that I also
find children a great joy.  He then asked a telling question, &#8220;Do you think I can be happily
married and be happy as a father?&#8221;  I told him that marriage helps people grow and change for
the better and that so do children.  He got married, he and his wife have three children and I will
never forget how proud he was to show photos of his first child soon after her birth.</p>
<p>What lessons can we learn from my colleague&#8217;s phone call. People will often not tell you they
respect you for your commitment to marriage and family.  But they are watching and as in this
case, modeling.  </p>
<p>Another thing we can do is replace fear with faith.   There is a tendency on the part of some of us
to hang back from relationships, to be preoccupied with the consequence of a mistake.  Don&#8217;t.  I
can remember some of those feelings myself.  I worried, for example how I could commit to
marriage when I did not know how I would provide for my family.  I wanted to have a clear sense
of how life would unfold.  The answer for me, then and now is found in my favorite hymn, &#8220;Lead
Kindly Light.&#8221;  The first verse that especially touched me then and now is, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom; Lead thou me on! The night is
dark, and I am far from home; Lead thou me on! Keep thou my feet; I do not ask
to see the distant scene,  one step enough for me.</i>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '&lt;span id="WPEndnote21" class="WPFloatStyle"&gt;' );
    document.write( WPEndnote21 );

    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>A third thing we can do is to keep trying.  Many here today either do not come from ideal
families or have not yet found a companion they love and who shares their commitment to be
sealed in the Lord&#8217;s house.  What are we to do in that event?   Elder Richard G. Scott has said,
&#8220;Seek diligently to fulfill the fundamental purposes of this life through the ideal family.  While
you may not have yet reached that ideal, do all you can through obedience and faith in the Lord to
consistently draw as close to it as you are able.&#8221; &#8220;If for the present, that does not include sealing
in the temple to a righteous companion, live for it, Pray for it.  Exercise faith that you will obtain
it.&#8221;&nbsp;
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '&lt;span id="WPEndnote22" class="WPFloatStyle"&gt;' );
    document.write( WPEndnote22 );
    document.write( '&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPEndnote22\')"&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;' );
    document.write( '&lt;/span&gt;' );
  }
</script>
  It is important for us to understand that we have the power to build our own families, to
accomplish change.</p>
<p>When we were married, my wife&#8217;s family was not active and could not be there with us at our
sealing in the temple.  Years later while we were visiting at the home of my wife&#8217;s parents,   the
doorbell rang and my mother-in-law said from the kitchen, &#8220;If it&#8217;s the home teachers, we are
busy.&#8221;  My wife answered the door and it was the home teachers.  She invited them in.  She and I
and the home teachers had a nice conversation.  After a while, my father-in-law appeared in the
doorway and surprised us all by asking what time church services were in the ward on Sunday.
We happily offered to go to church with him that Sunday.</p>
<p>Both my wife and I prayed for a great sacrament meeting. We prayed that our two young children
would be good during the meeting.  Our son and daughter were good but the meeting was not
spectacular.  The ward choir sang a little off key and the speakers were a little dry. But that was
not how my father-in-law saw the meeting.  He loved it.  He felt the spirit.  He wanted to go
back.  Inviting in those home teachers and attending that sacrament meeting started a process that
resulted in my both of my wife&#8217;s parents becoming active again, my father in law serving in the
bishopric of that ward and later, they as a couple served a proselyting mission to New Zealand. 
Never give up, keep trying to be an influence for good in your family.</p>
<p>We may also have opportunity to influence public policy.  We need to be informed and prepared
to express our views on marriage and family at every level of government.  Then we need to
speak out.  Remember what Sir Edmund Burke said, <i>&#8220;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil
is that good men do nothing.&#8221;</i>&nbsp;

  }
</script>
</p>
<p>I want to bear you my testimony that marriage is ordained of god to bless us, help us grow and
prepare us to return to him.  My marriage and my family are great blessings in my life.  I am
grateful for them.  In these relationships I have changed and to grown and have found the love
and support needed to make those changes. The same can be true for all of us.  Moreover,
investing in these relationships will pay eternal dividends. </p>
<p>I am grateful for living prophets and apostles who have taught us and the world the importance of
family.  I testify that their examples and teachings will help us avoid mistakes and find
happiness.  In the Name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>I appreciate the opportunity to be with you today.  At the outset, I offer my congratulations and
appreciation to President and Sister Bednar for all that they, and you, have accomplished since I
was last here.  Ricks College has become Brigham Young University-Idaho and, as you know,
the change in name has in many respects been the least of what has happened on this remarkable
campus in such a short time.  I also express gratitude to President Bednar for his support of and
encouragement to me personally.  He has been a BYU president for a much longer time than
have I and he has been generous in his expressions and actions.</p>
<p>One of the wonderful parts of my current life is my now regular opportunity to be with students. 
It is exciting, usually inspiring and quite interesting, most of the time.  Nearly all of the students I
see are very bright, friendly and committed to making the most they can of their lives in proper
ways.  They are thinking about the world around them, the growth and mission of the Church,
their families, their future careers and especially who it is they will marry and when.  Each of
these topics provides potential for sermons but I will forebear in addressing them all.  I do want
to make an observation that may help set a context for what I would like to discuss with you.</p>
<p>Often when we discuss future careers, students will comment in ways such as this:  &#8220;I don&#8217;t need
to be rich.  I just want to earn enough to support my family and be comfortable.&#8221;  That seems
very reasonable and even sensible to me.  The question does arise for me as to what we might
really mean by being &#8220;comfortable?&#8221;  I suspect we mean a reasonably nice home in a safe and
decent neighborhood.  We aspire to having enough food to eat and clothes to wear, a good car to
drive and so forth.  I think, however, we must also ask, &#8220;Is that all there is to being comfortable?&#8221; 
In this wonderful setting, with the things we understand and with all we value, I believe we will
agree that there is much more to concern us than what some have described as &#8220;creature
comforts&#8221; or the things that make our physical and temporal lives more pleasant.</p>
<p>The dictionary defines comfort as consolation; freedom from pain, trouble or anxiety; or in its
verb form, to give strength and hope to someone.  I believe we would all agree that we desire
comfort or to be comfortable in every way.  While we perhaps think of comfort in a temporal
sense more often than we might in a spiritual sphere, I would suggest that our spiritual comfort is
an issue of utmost importance.</p>
<p>All of us who believe in Jesus Christ take some consolation in the assurances of the Savior that
He will assist and help us in times of need &#8211; in other words, He will bring us comfort.  While we
accept this basic assertion, we may also be a little like His initial apostles who, while believing in
Him, were confused or unsure about what some of His teachings really meant in their every day
lives.  Stated another way, even the apostles were uncomfortable sometimes.</p>
<p>As Jesus began to teach His followers about the necessity of His leaving them for a time, their
discomfort increased.  Sensing this, He made specific promises to them that He would eventually
return and also that He would provide them with a &#8220;Comforter&#8221; in His absence (John 14:16).  Let
me read His words.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>If ye love me, keep my commandments.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may
abide with you for ever:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you </i>(John 14:15-16, 18).</p>
<p>We know that the Comforter mentioned is the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>For those members of the Church living in our day, we receive a very similar promise as we
partake of the sacrament weekly.  We reverently partake of the bread in remembrance of the body
of the Son and witness to Heavenly Father that we are willing to take upon us the name of His
Son, Jesus Christ, with the promise we make to always remember Him and keep His
commandments.  If we do so, then we have the promise in return that [we] &#8220; . . .<i> may always have
his Spirit to be with [us]</i>&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenants 20:77).  In my judgment, this is real comfort!</p>
<p>For most of us, we don&#8217;t dispute the principle or even its promise.  Rather, we accept it but also
may worry about how to really and reliably cause it to happen in our daily lives.  This is natural. 
We have many challenges to link appropriately what we know about basic doctrine with the
problems and opportunities we face in our lives.  </p>
<p>Today, I would like to talk with you about ways that we can narrow the gap between our
doctrinal understandings on the one hand, and our personal applications of the doctrine on the
other.  What I suggest will likely be helpful with any number of these kinds of issues, but I want
to spend our precious time today discussing what we might do so that we can realize the Savior&#8217;s
promise, &#8220;I will not leave you comfortless.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Fourth Article of Faith that many of us memorized in Primary is doctrinally basic.  I hope
you all know it and understand it.  You might wish to join with me as I quote it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We believe the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are: first, Faith in the
Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the
remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.</i></p>
<p>We understand that these principles and ordinances are basic and the order in which they are
given is important.  Faith of necessity precedes repentance which in turn comes before baptism is
efficacious, and all must occur before the bestowal of the Gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>It is the Holy Ghost that is the Comforter promised to us by the Savior.  For the Comforter to
fulfill His comforting role, we need to be qualified and prepared to receive these very special
ministrations.  Exercising faith and truly repenting of our sins are essential prerequisites along
with the ordinances of baptism and confirmation.  Like some other things in life, these first four
steps are necessary.  They may not, however, be fully sufficient until we have made some very
specific adjustments in our lives and are qualified to have these blessings impact and affect us in
ways that may be more deep and significant than we had previously understood.</p>
<p>We place a very high premium on &#8220;childlike faith&#8221; and yet, on occasion, may be confused in our
thinking.  Being childlike is not the same as being childish.  Our faith should be simple and
straightforward and yet must not be passive or unprepared.  Think of the understandable mistake
of Oliver Cowdery who wanted to join Joseph Smith in translating the Book of Mormon.  Should
Oliver be blamed because he wanted to do more than be a scribe?  I don&#8217;t believe so.  Did he
fully understand what would be required of him to take this larger step that he seemingly desired? 
Again, it appears that he did not.  Let me read some familiar verses from the account of this
episode.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Oliver Cowdery, verily, verily, I say unto you, that assuredly as the Lord liveth,
who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive a
knowledge of whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with an honest heart,
believing that you shall receive a knowledge concerning the engravings of old
records, which are ancient, which contain those parts of my scripture of which
has been spoken by the manifestation of my Spirit.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost,
which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by which
Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Therefore, this is thy gift; apply unto it, and blessed art thou, for it shall deliver
you out of the hands of your enemies, when, if it were not so, they would slay you
and bring your soul to destruction.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Oh, remember these words, and keep my commandments.  Remember, this is your
gift....</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Therefore, doubt not, for it is the gift of God; and you shall hold it in your hands,
and do marvelous works; and no power shall be able to take it away out of your
hands, for it is the work of God.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And, therefore, whatsoever you shall ask me to tell you by that means, that will I
grant unto you, and you shall have knowledge concerning it.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Remember that without faith you can do nothing; therefore ask in faith.  Trifle not
with these things; do not ask for that which you ought not </i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 8:1-5, 8-10).  </p>
<p>Like many of us, Oliver appeared to hear only what he wanted to hear.  He apparently focused on
the promised blessings but forgot some of the requirements to receive them.  He was told to
&#8220;doubt not,&#8221; to &#8220;ask in faith,&#8221; to &#8220;Trifle not with these things,&#8221; and very importantly, to &#8220;not ask
for that which you ought not.&#8221;  We don&#8217;t know all of the details of Oliver Cowdery&#8217;s failure
experience but we do know he was not able to translate.  </p>
<p>The entire eighth and ninth sections deserve our careful study because they contain lessons not
only for Oliver but also for us.  The Lord was patient in explaining why Oliver was not able to
translate even in the face of the promised blessing he had received by revelation.  Let me read
four further verses that I think are most vital for us to understand in our quest to have the
continued sustenance that can come only from the Comforter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Do not murmur, my son, for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after this
manner.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto
you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must
ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn
within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor
of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you
cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me </i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 9:6-9).  </p>
<p>This revelation had to do specifically with Oliver Cowdery and his desire to translate, but it also
applies generally to each of us with respect to the insights and knowledge we hope to obtain from
the Holy Ghost.  Just as the Savior tried to teach His early disciples the patterns they needed to
follow to achieve the blessings of the Comforter, He also has outlined the ways that we can
obtain the same blessings.</p>
<p>In recent training meetings with the General Authorities, President James E. Faust talked about
the necessity of our leaders having the Spirit to guide them.  What he said also should apply to
each of us.  He made some suggestions about how we can more surely qualify to receive the
blessings of the Spirit or to be spiritually comforted.  I will share some of them and then will
conclude by suggesting some ways we can be sure that we are being truly prompted by the Holy
Ghost once we have qualified to receive it.   Now to President Faust&#8217;s counsel:</p>
<p>First, we need to live so that we can merit the guidance of the Spirit.  This means that we need to
repent regularly of the mistakes we make and the sins we commit so that we are not living with
unresolved issues that impede the proper flow of Spiritual promptings or the ministering of
Angels.</p>
<p>For many of our missteps our repentance can be private or limited to those we have injured or
offended.  For particularly serious offenses, it is necessary that we confess to our bishop and seek
his assistance in the necessary repentance process.  The inspired order of the First Principles and
Ordinances of the Gospel found in the Fourth Article of Faith reminds us that faith and
repentance not only precede the ordinances of baptism and receiving the Gift of the Holy Ghost,
but also must occur before the remission of sins is possible and constant ministrations of the
Spirit in our daily lives can occur.</p>
<p>Second, we must never be complacent but must always try harder.  I am not suggesting that we
should become victims of perfectionism which can by itself be debilitating, but I am suggesting
that each of us really can do better in most areas of our lives as we attempt to keep our thoughts
and actions more consistent with the Savior&#8217;s example and direction for us.</p>
<p>Third, we need to exercise more faith.  President Faust used the example of the children of Israel
led by Joshua who were required to carry the Ark of the Covenant across the Jordan River.  The
miracle of holding back the water so that they could pass on dry ground with the Ark of the
Covenant could not occur until the soles of their feet actually touched the water  (Joshua 3:13).   </p>
<p>Exercising faith is not easy work and we are prone to forget that achieving the benefits of faith
actually requires that we exercise faith.  It is not unlike the daily intense physical training
required for many months before one is able to run a marathon in one day.  Moroni reminds us, </p>
<p><i>&#8220;. . . dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith&#8221; 
</i>(Ether 12:6).</p>
<p>Fourth, we need to purge ourselves of personal aggrandizement.  In other words, we need to do
what is right because it is right and not to bring attention or undue credit to ourselves. 
Remember the Savior&#8217;s counsel on giving alms.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth;</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself
shall reward thee openly </i>(Matthew 6: 3-4).  </p>
<p>We need to do the right things for the right reasons.</p>
<p>Fifth, beware of pride and flattery.  Satan knows you are not likely to commit major crimes or
even the most serious sins but also knows that most of us are easily tempted by pride or addicted
to flattery if we are not very careful to keep both feet on the ground.</p>
<p>Sixth, be humble and submissive.  This does not mean to be passive or &#8220;wobbly&#8221; but it does
mean that we should always remember this counsel:   &#8220;<i>Be thou humble and the Lord, thy God
will lead thee by the hand and give thee answers to thy prayers</i>&#8221; (Doctrine and Covenants
112:10).</p>
<p>Seventh, always try to act to promote that which is good for others, including praying for them
and serving them.  Remember that the &#8220;Golden Rule&#8221; is old but not outdated!</p>
<p>Eighth, learn to enjoy the fruits of the Spirit.  What are they?  I believe you know how you feel
when you have really prayed but then also have really listened and pondered.  You know how
you have felt when you have borne testimony and it has touched another life as well as your own. 
You know how good you feel when you are able to go to the temple with your life right and your
heart turned to the Lord and the Spirit.  I believe that if you carefully evaluate your life and your
experience, you will be surprised to recognize how often and how significantly you have been
blessed by the interventions of the Holy Ghost in helping you do good things and also in avoiding
serious mistakes.  Also, I have been taught by President Boyd K. Packer that we will never make
a serious mistake without being warned first.</p>
<p>Ninth, do works of righteousness.  I could give you examples or applications, but you already
know what they are.  The reason that most of us do not do more is not that we don&#8217;t know what
to do.  If you are worried, begin modestly with more regular scripture study even if for only a few
minutes a day.  If you do not pay fast offerings regularly, resolve to do so even if you can afford
to give only the cost of an apple or an egg. When you begin to think a little, your list of righteous
works that you can really accomplish now will grow in an amazing fashion.</p>
<p>You might add to President Faust&#8217;s list but I would caution us all to avoid making all of this too
complicated.  It really is not!  You usually know what it is you need to do when you carefully and
prayerfully think through the process of obtaining the direction of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The question that we might often have, which I believe is not only understandable but also
honorable, is &#8220;How can I really know when I am being directed or led by the Spirit?&#8221;</p>
<p>I might appropriately say that you will know and you will become increasingly comfortable over
time that you do know as you become more closely familiar with the ministrations of the Holy
Spirit.  It is possible, however, to be confused on occasion, even with the best of intentions.  I
would invite your careful consideration of the suggestions made by President Faust.  If your life
and your heart are right, then you can be more comfortable that you are on the right track.</p>
<p>Let me also offer a little test you might apply to inspiration that you may feel you are receiving as
you seek guidance on a particular matter or as you feel impressions coming, even when you did
not consciously seek them.  While you may still have questions after you apply the four criteria I
will mention, you will be able to know for sure when feelings have not come from the proper
source.  If the answer to the four questions that I suggest you apply to your promptings is always
yes, then you can continue to pray, ponder and seek confirmation until you are finally sure.  </p>
<p>If the answer to any of the four questions is no, then you can have confidence that the feeling you
have had is not from the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>First, is the feeling or impression you have consistent with the pronouncements of the Lord found
in the Scriptures?</p>
<p>Second, is your inspiration consistent with the statements and counsel of the living prophets?</p>
<p>Third, is the prompting you feel consistent with your own stewardship and scope of personal
responsibility? </p>
<p>Fourth, does your answer infringe on the agency of someone else?</p>
<p>Let me take each of these four measuring standards individually.  You will immediately
understand why they are important but may also occasionally feel so strongly about a matter that
you might make the mistake of failing to consider each measure fully.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us wonderful and extensive guidance in the scriptures.  Because the focus of
these inspired writings is on doctrine and principle, the specific application is usually left with
us.  For example, we know that keeping the Sabbath Day holy is a commandment, but how we do
it, in part--and even in some places in the world, when we do it--is left to our best judgment.  We
need to know the doctrines well and also be exposed to them regularly so that we are not misled. 
Most individuals who believe that they have doctrinal issues with the Church really do not know
the doctrine!</p>
<p>It is a serious mistake to take the counsel of living prophets lightly or to disregard it.  This means
we need to know what they have said and thus we have the responsibility to listen to General
Conference, read the <i>Ensign,</i> and pay attention to their statements and pronouncements.  A rather
common error made even by some who consider themselves to be faithful church members is to
say that &#8220;the brethren really do not understand my circumstances and therefore their directions do
not apply to me.&#8221;  A much better approach is to have the attitude, &#8220;given the experience and
closeness to the Lord of His servants, I will try to understand and apply to my own situation their
counsel and direction.&#8221;  When we take that approach, we will almost always understand and
appreciate the wisdom of their direction in helping us avoid serious errors in our own lives.</p>
<p>It is a too common misjudgment to develop feelings or express opinions that are outside the
scope of our own stewardship.  A bishop only receives revelation for his ward, not another.  Only
the President of the Church receives the Lord&#8217;s direction for the entire Church.  A father and
mother are entitled to Divine direction related to their own family but the neighbors are not
instructed through them.  We will frequently see others&#8217; mistakes and achievements, as they will
often see ours, but the gospel principle that revelation is always restricted to our own proper
sphere is clear.</p>
<p>On occasion, we may receive promptings that affect us and may also involve others.  This opens
the potential for confusion unless we clearly understand the doctrines and principles of agency
and revelation.  As missionaries, many of us have felt prompted that certain investigators know
what we have taught is true and that they should accept baptism and confirmation.  This is a
sweet experience that often inspires us to work and pray harder to assist the investigators with
their challenges.  Ultimately, however, the investigator must also receive the impression and act
on it.  However impressive the spiritual experience of the missionary, the investigator must have
the &#8220;mighty change of heart&#8221; himself or herself for the conversion to really occur.  Missionaries
are required to provide the environment in part and share their testimonies, but are not authorized
to dictate individual decisions or impose their own impressions that would violate the agency of
another.</p>
<p>Similarly, a rather common experience may occur here with you at BYU<font face="Times New Roman">Ã¢Â€Â“</font>Idaho while you are
dating.  We encourage it, by the way!  One of you may have the compelling spiritual
confirmation that another should be his or her eternal companion.  Happily, both often seem to
have the same spiritual experience, as I review your statistics.  Unhappily, on occasion only one
of you has the inspiration that you are meant for each other.  Since both have not had the same
experience, each is responsible for the light they have received and neither potential partner has
the right to try to impose personal revelation on another.  Each of us must make key decisions for
ourselves and be sure that we allow and encourage others to do the same.</p>
<p>Another challenge to achieving all of the comfort that we desire has to do with the issue of
timing.  In our urge to progress and achieve, including those precious things that come only from
the Spirit, we might be a little like the man who was reported to have prayed: &#8220;Dear God, I pray
for patience, and I want it right now!&#8221;  One of the blessings of getting a little older is the
realization that comes that our timing is not always the same as God&#8217;s.  Thus, the scriptures
preach the virtue of patience (Mosiah 3:19) and describe it as an essential in overcoming the
&#8220;natural man.&#8221;  I like the words of Arnold Glasgow:  <i>&#8220;The key to everything is patience.  You get
the chicken by hatching the egg &#8211; not by smashing it&#8221; </i>(Peter&#8217;s Quotations, pg. 375).</p>
<p>Let me share, in conclusion, a few passages of scripture that may be helpful to us in our own
thinking.  The Lord has said, <i>&#8220;I will hasten my work in its time&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and Covenats 88:73). 
He has also said, <i>&#8220;But all things must come to pass in their time&#8221;</i> (Doctrine and Covenants
64:32).  We need to hasten when we can, but also must recognize the need for patience in our
progress.  Likewise, we need to prioritize and appropriately stretch ourselves as we strive to
improve but also remember the Lord&#8217;s counsel that you <i>&#8220;Do not run faster or labor more than
you have strength and means provided . . . .&#8221; </i> (Doctrine anf Covenants 10:4).</p>
<p>The Lord&#8217;s promise that we can be truly comforted is more significant than we know.  The Gift
of the Holy Ghost is one of the fruits of the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ that can make our
plea, <i>&#8220;Lead me, guide me, walk beside me, Help me find the way.  Teach me all that I must do To
live with him someday&#8221; </i>a reality in our lives (Hymn #301, I Am a Child of God).</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several years ago I attended a regional conference of combined BYU stakes.  President Faust was
one of the speakers.  His wife, Ruth, was accompanying him, so he brought her to the pulpit by
his side as he began.  He told how she was the love of his life and how he had to work at winning
her over.  Then he said, <i>&#8220;Our first kiss was at the marriage altar &#8211; but we&#8217;ve been making up for
it ever since.&#8221; </i> I got several great messages from that little scenario.  One of them was that
President Faust knew his audience.  He piqued everyone&#8217;s interest by talking about a subject that
is never far from college students&#8217; minds.  I decided I should also try to speak about a subject that
is endlessly fascinating for young adults, and really for all of us &#8211; courtship and marriage.  But I
can&#8217;t really do this without talking about the foundational virtue of both of these, which is
friendship.   So today I want to share some gospel perspectives on three &#8220;ships&#8221;: friend-ship,
court-ship, and physical relation-ship.</p>
<p>Today I would like to make three points about these &#8220;ships.&#8221;  First, friendship is a gospel
principle; it is not only nice but necessary to our emotional and spiritual well-being.  Second,
friendship is the foundation upon which courtship and marriage should be built and can thrive. 
And third, a physical relationship before marriage can preclude the building of a strong
friendship foundation, but can enhance that friendship after marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">FRIENDSHIP</span></p>
<p>Friendship is a gospel principle.  In fact, Joseph Smith said that </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Friendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of &#8216;Mormonism&#8217;...It is a
time-honored adage that love begets love.  Let us pour forth love&#8211;show forth our
kindness unto all mankind, and the Lord will reward us with everlasting
increase...Friendship is like Brother Turley in his blacksmith shop welding iron to
iron; it unites the human family with its happy influence </i>(HC 5:517).  </p>
<p>I love the Prophet&#8217;s image of Brother Turley in his blacksmith shop.  Like Brother Turley,
friendship welds hearts together with bonds of love and affection.</p>
<p>How important is friendship to you?  How does it bless your life?  Have you ever felt friendless? 
I remember in my teen years sometimes throwing myself on my bed and sobbing, &#8220;nobody likes
me, everybody hates me; I&#8217;m going out and eat worms.&#8221;  It&#8217;s miserable to feel lonely and without
friends.  Friendship is necessary to our well-being &#8211; not just nice but necessary.  We all hunger
for it; it&#8217;s a universal need.</p>
<p>This was brought home to me by one of my Young Women General Board members who took
some personal trips this past summer.  In her travels, she visited with young women in Brazil,
Mongolia, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Idaho.  In each place, she asked them questions about
their lives and compiled their answers.  Here are the questions she asked, along with the most
frequent response she received to each question:   </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Question</i>: What makes you happy?  <i>Answer</i>: Friends.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">What are your greatest worries?  Friends.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">What do you like to do in you free time?  Be with friends.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">What do you spend most of your time thinking about?  Friends.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">What do you like about Young Women?  Being with friends.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">What do you like about Church?  Seeing my friends.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Why don&#8217;t young women come to Mutual?  No friends.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">Why do the young women go inactive?  Pressure of friends.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that amazing!  Friends are of paramount importance for young women all over the world. 
And I&#8217;m sure that young men would give similar answers.  So, too, would many adults.  We all
need friends.</p>
<p>A statement by the British writer Francis Bacon helps explain why.  Bacon wisely said: <i>&#8220;Good
friends multiply joys and divide griefs.&#8221; </i> This truth certainly resonates in my soul and is
confirmed by my own experience.  Friends have made my good days even sweeter and my bad
days more bearable.</p>
<p>Modern prophets and ancient scriptures also speak of the importance of friendship.  They teach
that it is a holy influence, a heavenly gift.  I have already mentioned how Joseph Smith felt about
friendship: how he described it as a fundamental principle of the gospel, a sacred weld that binds
the human family together.  The Prophet was a wonderful example of what he preached.  Joseph
was made for friendship.  By nature he was generous and loving, with a heart as wide as eternity. 
He loved all people, and especially his people. </p>
<p>Joseph explained that, as Latter-day Saints, we are bound in love by our baptism not only with
God but with others.  He taught that a special love can exist among Latter-day Saints who share
common covenants and commitments.  This does not mean we exclude those not of our faith.  In
fact, our covenants allow us to even better be able to reach out to others.  The Prophet said, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>There is a love from God that should be exercised toward those of our faith, who walk
uprightly, which is peculiar to itself, but it is without prejudice; it also gives scope to the
mind, which enables us to conduct ourselves with greater liberality towards all that are
not of our faith... </i>(HC 3:304).</p>
<p>Likewise President George Albert Smith lived his whole life by a personal creed that mostly dealt
with how he interacted with other people.  He both advocated and practiced such mottos as this: </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8226;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><i>I would be a friend to the friendless and find joy in ministering to the needs of the
poor.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><i><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8226;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I would not knowingly wound the feelings of any, not even one who may have
wronged me but would seek to do him good and make him my friend. </i></p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a similar vein, President Gordon B. Hinckley will long be remembered for what he has taught
about the importance of friends.  In order to continue faithful in the kingdom each person needs a
friend, a responsibility, and nurturing with the good word of God.  </p>
<p>Each of these modern prophets has taught that friendship is an integral part of keeping the
covenants we have made.</p>
<p>Likewise, ancient prophets taught the value of covenant friendship.  Consider the example of the
people of Alma who fled from wicked King Noah to the waters of Mormon.  There, they
expressed their desire to come into the fold of God.  Alma asked them if they were willing to
bear one another&#8217;s burdens, to mourn with those that mourn, and comfort those who stand in
need of comfort.  That is, he asked them if they were willing to covenant to act as friends.  They
clapped their hands for joy to enter into such a covenant.  And their hearts were knit together in
unity and love.  This is a great scriptural example of covenant friendship. (Mosiah 18)</p>
<p>Finally, as always, we can look to Jesus Christ for the greatest example of friendship.  &#8220;Friend&#8221;
was the highest compliment he could pay his disciples.  He said, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.  Greater
love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.  Ye are my
friends....I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth;
but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have
made known unto you </i>(John 15:12-15).</p>
<p>If friendship is of such paramount importance in the teachings of our prophets and our Savior,
shouldn&#8217;t we be striving to be great, covenant-keeping friends?  To be such a friend is Christ-like; to have such friends is heavenly.  As Latter-day Saints, we know that exaltation involves the
privilege of spending eternity with our true friend, the Savior, and others who have become like
him.  The scriptures give us this glorious promise:  <i>&#8220;And that same sociality which exists among
us here shall exist among us there, only coupled with the eternal glory...&#8221; </i>(Doctrine and
Covenants 130:2).  Our goal should be to spend eternity enjoying the sociality of Christ and
Christ-like others.    </p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">COURTSHIP</span></p>
<p>This brings me to my second &#8220;ship&#8221;: Courtship.  Friendship should play a key role in courtship
and marriage.  I see friendship as the foundation in the courtship pyramid.  Two little stories will
help to illustrate this point.  </p>
<p>After we were married I heard my husband say quite frequently in teaching settings that he didn&#8217;t
marry me for my looks.  Finally one day I told him that this did not really sound like a
compliment.  He was genuinely surprised because he had meant it to be high praise.  He wanted
people to know that what he valued most about me was who I was intrinsically.  He was trying to
say that our love was not based on superficial looks but on genuine friendship.  I understood, but
I wasn&#8217;t sure that others did.  So he has since started saying, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t marry Susan for her looks
<span style="text-decoration: underline">alone</span>.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The other is the story of Isaac and Rebecca.  This is not the Biblical account however.  It is about
our daughter Rebecca and her suitor Isaac.  Our Rebecca was not persuaded to marry her Isaac
nearly as easily as was the Old Testament Rebekah.  Nor was she readily willing to give up her
lifestyle and immediately leave her family to be part of another&#8217;s life.  Our Becky was 21.  She
had signed up to do a summer internship through BYU in Mozambique (much to her parents&#8217;
dismay, because it was a time of flooding, disease, and great unrest in that country).  She wasn&#8217;t
sure if she should serve a mission, but she had at least started the paperwork by getting dental
and doctor appointments.  She was also thinking about applying for a master&#8217;s program in her
field.  In short she was trying to decide what to do with the next phase of her life.  We all
wondered which would win out of the 3 M&#8217;s &#8211; Mozambique, mission, or masters.  Meanwhile
Isaac came along in her pursuit and soon offered a choice of a fourth M - marriage.  He was
headed for medical school in a few months and he did not want to go without Becky.  He later
told us that he had his own 3 M&#8217;s that he hoped she would choose &#8211;  marriage to me, medical
school, and eventually motherhood.  &#8220;If she didn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I knew I would be the fourth M -
miserable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Becky was a woman of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.  The world and its many glamorous opportunities were
available to her and it was hard for her to relinquish some of her dreams.  What finally won her
over was Isaac&#8217;s intrinsic goodness and his kindness to her.  He did the romantic things too, like
sending beautiful bouquets of flowers, taking her on nice dates, and so on.  But those things
would not have won her over on their own.  What was most winning to her was how he
continually put her feelings and her needs above his own.  He did little thoughtful things, the
kinds of things that one friend would do for another.  For example, when he learned that her
watch was too big for her wrist, he actually made his own little tool so he could remove a couple
of links from it and make it perfect for her.  Another time she found her little old car spotless and
sparkling inside and out because he washed it, a deed unsolicited by her.  Another time, she
found a little list he had made of ways to improve himself; many of his goals were service-oriented.  Becky realized that he had the qualities that would endure through good and bad times,
the very qualities she would seek out in a good friend.  So she did marry Isaac.  And now she
reflects that she was right about his great strengths being a wonderful asset to their relationship. 
She feels she is married to her best friend.  And this is what marriage should be.</p>
<p>The poet John Milton taught this principle in his great epic poem on the Fall, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Paradise Lost</span>.  One
of the things that Adam loves most about Eve in the poem is:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Those thousand decencies that daily flow</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>From all her words and actions mixt with Love</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign&#8217;d</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Union of Mind, or in us both one Soul;</i></p>
<p>For Milton the most important quality in marriage is companionship.  In marriage there should be
a  union of the mind and soul, not just the body.   Becky was also attracted to Isaac for his
thousand daily decencies.  These kindnesses promised an enduring friendship; they expressed
qualities of character that would last even when physical beauties eventually fade. </p>
<p>Friendship, then, should form the foundation of romantic love&#8211;the love that leads to courtship
and marriage.  Likewise, both friendship and romantic love can only become what God intends
them to be when they are founded on charity, the &#8220;pure love of Christ.&#8221;  As we learn in Moroni
and Corinthians, charity is patient, long-suffering, kind, free from envy, and unselfish.  Charity
leads lovers to rejoice in truth, to believe, to hope, and to endure.  Couples whose love is based
on charity want the best for each other.  Their love is infused with the pure love of Christ.  These
are the qualities we should seek for in courtship and marriage. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has
taught the need to base romance in charity.  He said, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Do you want capability, safety, and security in dating and romance, in married
life and eternity. Be a true disciple of Jesus.  Be a genuine, committed, word-and-deed Latter-day Saint.  Believe that your faith has everything to do with your
romance, because it does.  You separate dating from discipleship at your peril. 
Jesus Christ, the Light of the World, is the only lamp by which you can
successfully see the path of love and happiness </i> New Era, Oct. 2003, p. 8).</p>
<p>I, like you, see many examples around me of marriages that are built upon these foundational
qualities.</p>
<p>My own parents&#8217; marriage is grounded in charity.  They always build each other up.  The only
words I hear them say or have ever heard them say about one another are positive.  They are
currently serving in the Nauvoo temple.  These are the kinds of things they say to me when I call
them.  &#8220;You should have seen how compassionate Dad was with our tired temple workers.  He
loves them and leads them in a Christlike manner.&#8221;  Or &#8220;Mom always has the right messages; she
inspires our missionaries in everything she says and does.&#8221;  My parents have a wonderful
marriage.  I have seen it working inside and out through the years.  </p>
<p>One of the truths my mom taught me is that such a marriage does not just automatically happen. 
She told me it takes work, that you can never let a single day go by without nourishing your
marriage relationship.  This is what Mormon taught.  He said that we should<i> &#8220;pray unto the
Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love</i>&#8221; (Moroni 7:48).  This
love, which is a gift that we must earnestly seek and strive to develop can be a powerful building
block in our relationships.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;ve seen people who let things slip, who belittle each other, who are critical
and unkind.  I really believe that others improve their behavior more readily when they are
praised than if they are constantly critiqued.  One woman affirmed this idea. She wrote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>One evening I was frustrated with my husband and wanted to let him know how I felt. . . I
began writing down my feelings in a letter to him in the hope that he would . . . begin
working on his shortcomings.  </i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>I wrote and wrote and wrote.  Putting my thoughts on paper made me feel better, so I
closed my epistle with, &#8216;You really have many fine attributes that I value, but I kept this
letter focused on what concerns me tonight.&#8217;  At that moment, the thought came to me,
</i>Why don&#8217;t you write him a letter listing only his good qualities that you love so much?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I found myself thinking, That&#8217;s a good idea. So I temporarily set aside the first
letter and began writing again. . . .  After I wrote many pages, my appreciation
for him grew, and I was filled with love.  So I threw away my first letter and gave
him only the second, positive one.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>What a blessing that letter has been for us both.  My husband appreciated having
his good points recognized, and his interest was kindled in doing even more
things better.  And I have been motivated to be less critical of him and more
mindful of correcting my own shortcomings.  I am forever grateful for the
inspiration that taught me how to see a loving alternative rather than to vent my
frustration in a nonconstructive way. </i> (Kathleen Bikker, Ensign, March, 1997)</p>
<p>One of the ways to develop a strong, loving relationship is with sound communication.
Communication is the way a good relationship begins and also endures.  My unmarried children
ask me quite constantly how it is that anyone ever gets together.  It seems like such a mysterious
puzzle.  I know that everyone&#8217;s falling-in-love story is different. But there seems to be at least
one commonality among most stories.  This is a spontaneity in conversation.  So many couples
try to explain why they were attracted to each other.  They say things like, &#8220;we just talked and
talked; I  lost track of time when we were talking; it was so comfortable to talk; we share the
same sense of humor; we loved talking about our similar interests and values.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It was like that for me on my first date with my husband. All evening we were surrounded by
myriads of people, but I felt like it was just the two of us.   First we went to a banquet and then 
to a gala Fine Arts Ball at BYU.  I remember at the beginning we politely went around the dinner
table and introduced everyone.  Then just John and I talked to each other, non-stop, the rest of the
evening.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard it said that &#8220;Love is a long conversation.&#8221;  I believe it.  In fact I often joke with our
children that if I ever run out of things to say to Dad, then the marriage will be over.  I&#8217;m pretty
safe at saying that, because we love to talk to one another about everything.</p>
<p>This communication that is so fun and heady in a friendship is also essential as you really get to
know someone&#8217;s deeper self.  Look at what happened to the people at the time of the tower of
Babel when &#8220;the Lord confounded the language of the people.&#8221;  They were scattered and
confused, because they could not communicate.  The same thing happens to us when we can&#8217;t or
we choose not to talk with someone. A relationship may never develop into a courtship because it
can&#8217;t get beyond inch-deep generalities.  When there is no communication in a marriage
relationship difficulties arise, misunderstandings occur, and feelings may be wounded. President
Hinckley said, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I hear so many complaints from men and women that they cannot communicate
with one another.  Perhaps I am naive, but I do not understand this. 
Communication is essentially a matter of conversation.  They must have
communicated when they were courting.  Can they not continue to speak together
after marriage?  Can they not discuss with one another in an open and frank and
candid and happy way their interests, their problems, their challenges, their
desires?  It seems to me that communication is largely a matter of talking with
one another.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But let that talk be quiet, for quiet talk is the language of love.  It is the language
of peace.  It is the language of God. . . The voice of heaven is a still small voice. 
The voice of peace in the home is a quiet voice</i> (&#8220;Cornerstones of a Happy Home,&#8221;
Jan. 29, 1984).</p>
<p>We sometimes look for happiness in exotic places, like Mozambique, and for romance in
mystique, money, or charm. We sometimes look just for looks.  Instead, we need to look for
friends who embody Christlike character.  As you date, seek friendships which have enduring
strength and which can provide a firm foundation for a marriage.  After you have established a
solid, virtuous base in your relationship there is a place at the peak of the pyramid for physical
intimacy.  This brings me to my final point.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline">PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP</span></p>
<p>The physical relationship between a man and a woman can be wonderful and good&#8211;a beautiful
blessing.  However, if the physical part of romance comes too early or too fast in a relationship it
can take over.  Then it can become the tail that wags the dog.  Our physical emotions are
powerful and exciting.  This is how they are meant to be.  But this is precisely why they need to
be kept in check until other fundamental parts of the relationship are developed. </p>
<p>Alma counseled his son Shiblon to &#8220;bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love.&#8221; 
Note that Shiblon was a righteous son.  Nevertheless, Alma knew that even a good son needed
this timeless advice.  What Alma was saying to his son is the very thing that I have been trying to
teach you.  It is that you must put off your passionate natures until you have developed in a
relationship a foundation of love or charity.  You must control physical desires, lest they control
you.  Then the promise is that &#8220;ye may be filled with love.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Another scriptural phrase that might be applicable here is being  &#8220;clothed with the robes of
righteousness.&#8221;  That phrase from the scriptures may be better understood when we know about
an old Arabic custom.  If a young man was fleeing for his life he would seek refuge in the tent of
a great leader.  The chief would place the hem of his robe over the shoulder of the young guest
and declare him under his protection from all his enemies.   At one point Nephi pleads with the
Lord to be protected from his enemies.  He says, <i>&#8220;O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the
robe of thy righteousness!  O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine enemies!&#8221;
</i>(2 Nephi 4:33).  One of those enemies was sin.  I would like to clothe all of our young people in
such robes of protection from sin.  What might those robes be for us?  </p>
<p>We have taught our children some principles that we hope have provided robes of protection for
them.  We tried to create some catchy phrases so they would remember them easily in times of
danger and decision.  Let me share just four principles that will protect you like a robe of
righteousness if you remember them and abide by them.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">1.  Avoid the <span style="font-weight: bold">dangers of the dark</span>.  Stay in well lighted places.  Literally and
figuratively.  There&#8217;s wisdom to leaving the lights on&#8211;on the porch, in the living
room, at the dance.  And there&#8217;s safety in shunning  places that feel dark in spirit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">2.  Beware the <span style="font-weight: bold">hazard of the horizontal</span>.  Don&#8217;t lie down together with a date. 
Just don&#8217;t do it - not to watch a movie, or to read a book, or to rest at a picnic.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">3.  Remember the <span style="font-weight: bold">perils of privacy</span>.  Find public places to be alone.  Learn to
have your intimate talks where others are.  There is great safety in being together
where you can easily be interrupted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">4.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Modesty is a must.</span>  Everything about your appearance, your speech, and your
demeanor should bespeak that you are a literal spirit son or daughter of Heavenly
Father. If we truly understand the paramount significance of our bodies in our
Father&#8217;s plan, we would show great honor for our bodies.   When you dress and
act modestly others also</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">will treat you with respect. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You will also protect yourself if you choose to be with others who are also trying to make good
choices.  Someone with whom you will want to share the rest of your life will only want the very
best for you.  It says in <span style="text-decoration: underline">For the Strength of Youth</span>, <i>&#8220;Choose friends who share your values so you
can strengthen and encourage each other in living high standards.  A true friend will encourage
you to be your best self.&#8221;  </i></p>
<p>The Savior powerfully taught this principle in Matthew 18:8, <i>&#8220;Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot
offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life halt or
maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.&#8221; </i> The Joseph
Smith translation on this verse offers the following clarification: a <i>&#8220;man&#8217;s hand is his friend, and
his foot, also.&#8221; </i>Sometimes it&#8217;s necessary to break off relationships rather than trying to remain
close friends.  This is especially true of romantic relationships with boyfriends and girlfriends
who draw us away from righteousness.  When such friends &#8220;offend&#8221; you, when they lead you
toward inappropriate intimacy or other temptations, you should &#8220;cast&#8221; them off rather than
following them into dark paths</p>
<p>After one is married all of the richness of Heavenly Father&#8217;s blessings can be ours, both
physically and spiritually.  A sweet and wholesome physical relationship can help married
couples face the world.  Problems seem solvable and challenges seem conquerable.  And even if
they are not, they seem endurable to couples united by the sweet intimacy of married love.  A
dear friend spoke about this at the adult session of our Stake Conference once.  She said, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Isn&#8217;t it amazing that you can have sick children, unpaid bills, car trouble, and
your roof leaking, but if you can retire at night and happily give physical love to
one another, you don&#8217;t care if the bills ever get paid, or the car or roof ever get
fixed... and sometimes, you almost forget about the children...but you have one
another....you are two against the world.  On the other hand, you may have a
Porsche in one garage and a Cadillac in the other, a country home and a city
condominium and no bills at all, but it you are not compatible and secure in each
other&#8217;s love, able to thoroughly enjoy your giving of love, you feel you have
nothing (name withheld). </i></p>
<p>&#160;The Lord planned for us to become one in every way.  The physical relationship can help cement
our spiritual union.  We are made for each other.</p>
<p>Our model is in the very first love story.  The Lord said that it was not good that Adam should be
alone.  So the Lord created Eve to be &#8220;an help meet for him.&#8221;  Through a misunderstanding of the
old-fashioned term &#8220;meet&#8221; the words &#8220;helpmeet&#8221; and &#8220;helpmate&#8221; have been invented and
accepted in our language.  However the real meaning of this scripture is that Eve was created to
be a &#8220;meet&#8221; help for Adam.  &#8220;Meet&#8221; means &#8220;fit&#8221; or &#8220;suitable.&#8221;  So Eve was a helper who is
&#8220;suited to, worthy of, or corresponding to him.&#8221;  After that Adam was taught that they should
&#8220;cleave unto one another and they twain should become one flesh.&#8221;  So here are all of the
elements we have been discussing today - being suited for each other first and then adding the
physical relationship.</p>
<p>I began with President Faust&#8217;s cute and enduring love story.  Now let me conclude with President
and Sister Hinckley&#8217;s.  He said at a CES fireside and then again just recently in the General
Relief Society Meeting:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>May I be personal for a moment?  I sat at dinner across the table from my wife
the other evening. It was fifty-five years ago that we were married in the Salt Lake
Temple. The wondrous aura of young womanhood was upon her.  She was
beautiful, and I was bewitched.  Now, for more than half a century, we have
walked together though much of storm as well as sunshine.  Today neither of us
stands as tall as we once did.  As I looked at her across the table, I noted a few
wrinkles in her face and hands.  But are they less beautiful than before? No, in

<p>To me that sounds like the epitome of sanctified, fulfilling friendship and love.  I know what it is
to have such a friend.  I love my husband John for his &#8220;thousand daily decencies that daily flow
from all [his] words and actions mixed with Love&#8221; in our relationship.  He was kind and
thoughtful and romantic in our courtship.  Then even when he was going to school full time,
working full time and we had three children under the age of four, he continued to be kind and
thoughtful and romantic with me. He has shown this by helping me in my busy roles. He bathed
the children every night.  He scrubbed the kitchen floor.  He was also my window to the world &#8211;
keeping me abreast to what was happening out there.  Through the years he provided for us in
every way.  He encouraged me as a mother. He supported the children in plays, concerts, athletic
events, and papers to write.  He would give me moments of reprieve &#8211; on walks or weekend
getaways,  taking me to the temple or occasionally on his travels.  In my most recent assignment,
he has been solicitous and loving in every way.  When I come home tired at night he makes
cheese toast and other such delicacies, so I don&#8217;t have to cook.  He is my muse and my editor in
my writing and talks.  He prays for me and gives me priesthood blessings.  He is a &#8220;meet&#8221; help or
a help suited  for me in every way.  Since he re-scheduled some of his important work to be here
with me today, I would like to pay tribute to him with this 17<sup>th</sup> Century love poem by Anne
Bradstreet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">John D. Lamb</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just this last August, I was thumbing through my latest
issue of Chemical and Engineering News (thatÂ’s like the Time magazine for
chemists), when I was brought up short by a full page article that read Â“The
10th International Conference on Cold Fusion is taking place this week in
Cambridge, MassÂ…Â” The title of the article had an intriguing ring about it:
Â“Science, Religion, and the Art of Cold FusionÂ”.Â  Mentioning the term Â“cold
fusionÂ” brings back some chilling memories (pardon the pun) to me, because I
was personally caught up in this story about 15 years ago.Â  ItÂ’s a fascinating
story, in fact one of the <i>most</i> fascinating in all the annals of
scientific history, and I have a feeling it will be summoned up by teachers of
scientific philosophy, history and ethics for centuries to come.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many of you are probably too young to remember the cold
fusion episode.Â  The setting is the state of Utah, where it so happened that
scientists at two schools were working on related, but distinct, research
projects.Â  Those two schools, long rivals like the Montagues and Capulets, were
the University of Utah and BYU.Â  The two groups were working on ways to bring
about nuclear fusion at room temperature.Â  The time was the late 1980Â’s.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To appreciate the full import of cold fusion, we need to
take a short side trip into the interesting realm of nuclear physics.Â  But
waitÂ—before your eyes glaze over and you find your mind wandering, trust meÂ—it <i>will</i>
be short.Â  The principle is simply this:Â  if you can get two atomic nuclei to
collide and stick together, you can get a whole lot of energy out.Â  In fact,
thatÂ’s the process that powers the sun.Â  Physicists have been trying to get
nuclei to come together this way to produce useful energy for 50 years; but
alas, thereÂ’s a really big problem.Â  Atomic nuclei are positively charged, and
since, as you learned in high school, Â“like charges repelÂ”, getting two nuclei
close enough together to stick is really hard.Â  You have to crash them together
at very high speed, speeds corresponding to temperatures in the millions of
degrees.Â  So, scientists and engineers have been frustrated in their attempts
to create fusion reactors on earth.Â  Yet they havenÂ’t given up, because the
benefits to mankind would be phenomenal.Â  Imagine a world where energy like
electricity was boundless and cheap, and the byproducts of energy production
were environmentally friendly. ThatÂ’s what weÂ’re talking about.Â  But because of
the problems with trying to contain fusion reactions operating at millions of
degrees, the saying was coined: Â“Fusion is the energy source of the futureÂ… and
always will be.Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well, back in the 1980Â’s there was a small community of
researchers looking at some possible tricky waysÂ—using some of the subtleties
of quantum mechanicsÂ—to get fusion reactions to occur at room temperature.Â  Of
course, room temperature is Â“coldÂ” compared to the sun, ergo the term Â“cold
fusion.Â”Â  It was a long shot, but a goal well worth pursuing.Â  Anybody who
could figure out how to do it would surely get the Nobel Prize, and probably
become the worldÂ’s first trillionaire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the early researchers in this field was Steven
Jones.Â  He worked on some cold fusion ideas just down the road from here at
INEEL in Idaho Falls.Â  Then he joined the BYU faculty in 1985.Â  He had a proven
track record in cold fusion research by 1989Â—thatÂ’s an important year in this
storyÂ—having published a number of papers in peer-reviewed journals and having
had federal funding for several years on this topic.Â  He was claiming to see
tiny bits of cold fusion reaction, far too little to be practical for producing
commercial energy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then, in 1989, enter upon the scene two chemists from the
University of Utah, Professors Pons and Fleischmann (actually Fleischmann was
visiting from England).Â  They had no record of publication or funding in the
area of cold fusion, or any other fusion for that matter.Â  They claimed to have
discovered high levels of cold fusion reactionsÂ—high enough to produce usable
power.Â  This claim shocked and excited the scientific community, and indeed the
whole world.Â  But the competing claims of very low levels of fusion from the
BYU group just over the hill were a major problem.Â  Anyway, after the
University of Utah made their cold fusion announcement, the story of cold
fusion got very complicated, and I wish I had the time here to share with you
all the lurid details.Â  Suffice it to say that no soap opera writer in
Hollywood could possibly concoct a more bizarre tale.Â  It includes claims of
scientific thievery, betrayal of trust between universities, a media feeding
frenzy, congressional hearings, an international scientific Â“gold-rushÂ”
involving hundreds of scientists, accusations of falsified data, threats of
lawsuits against fellow colleagues at the University of Utah who openly doubted
cold fusion, political maneuvering to acquire huge barrels of state and federal
funding, obfuscation of experimental details, laboratory explosions,
accusations of tampering with experimental samples by mysterious unknown
saboteurs at Texas A&amp;M, a libel suit against a respected Italian newspaper
which ended in the judge accusing the Utah scientists of being Â“separated from
reality,Â”Â  accusations of money laundering, calls for resignation of top
university officials, and on and on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For our purposes here today, it is sufficient to note only
the beginning and the ending of the cold fusion story.Â  It began in earnest
this way:Â  On March 23, 1989, the University of Utah held a fateful news
conference in which they announced that Pons and Fleischmann had achieved cold
fusion in simple, inexpensive electrochemical cells at a level high enough to
produce usable energy.Â  They had not published their claim in a scientific
journal; instead they took their announcement straight to the press.Â  The level
of fusion activity claimed was a trillion times larger than what Steve Jones
was claiming at BYU.Â  Of course, the whole world, and especially the scientific
community, went wild over the news from the University of Utah.Â  But as weeks
went by and other labs were unable to reproduce the Utah results, the elation
soured, and very quickly praise turned to disdain and ultimately to contempt.Â 
The claims made by the University of Utah of high levels of cold fusion were
rejected by the vast majority of scientists.Â  And this is the way the story
ends:Â  careers ruined, huge amounts of money wasted, and the good name of a
respected university, the University of Utah, sullied.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the time, I was serving as Executive Director of Research
Administration at BYU, so it was interesting for me to watch all this from the
sidelines.Â  Of course, 99% of the attention about cold fusion was directed at
the University of Utah, since only they were claiming fusion at useful levels.Â 
BYUÂ’s reputation came out of the situation more or less unscathed.Â  But the
University of Utah was left with an enormous black eye.Â  What had gone wrong?Â 
How is it possible that well educated scientists, administrators, state
legislators, congressmen, senators, media science specialists, a whole nation
full of educated people could have blown it so badly? Could all this have been
avoided?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">IÂ’m here today to consider together with you, not the story
of cold fusion per se, but the very much-related question:Â  How can one
intelligently evaluate scientific claims?Â  It turns out that cold fusion
provides an excellent case study in considering this question.Â  Physics
professor and author Robert Park places cold fusion within the category he
calls Â“Voodoo ScienceÂ”Â—hence the name of my talk.Â  My purpose here is to
provide you with some of the tools necessary to decide whether a claim like
cold fusion is voodoo science or not.Â  Now, in case there are any in the
audience who have come hoping that they will learn how to make voodoo dolls to
get back at pesky roommates, IÂ’m afraid youÂ’re going to be disappointed.Â 
Voodoo science in this context has to do with scientific claims that seem
plausible, but just arenÂ’t soÂ—like perpetual motion machines or astrology.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At this point, you might be tempted to say to yourself:Â  Why
should I care whether something is voodoo science or not?Â  Let the scientists
battle it out.Â  But IÂ’m afraid you canÂ’t get off the hook that easily.Â  Voodoo
science can jump out and hit anyone at any time from any direction.Â  You may
have a sister-in-law who wants to sell you some new Â“alternative medicineÂ”
which cures your tendonitis; or you may hear on the news that using cell phones
will give you cancer.Â  YouÂ’re going to have to decide:Â  are these claims
reliable?Â  Should I buy from my sister-in-law?Â  Should I quit using my cell
phone?Â  Make the wrong choice, and youÂ’ll end up feeling like someone has stuck
a voodoo doll of you full of pins!Â  Hopefully today we can provide you with an
inoculation against the effects of voodoo scienceÂ—a few tools you can use to
pull those pins or prevent them from sticking you in the first place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the outset, I want you to imagine that you are a member of
the Utah State Legislature in 1989.Â  A delegation of University of Utah
administrators and scientists has just asked your assembly to authorize
spending $5M on cold fusion research.Â  (This is indeed what happened.)Â  YouÂ’re
not a scientist, but you have a very short time to decide how youÂ’re going to
vote.Â  What are the key questions you should be asking?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is a topic I spend a good deal of time talking about
with an honors class I teach on this subject.Â  We list two fundamental
characteristics of a dependable scientific claim:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(1) it is supported by reliable, reproducible observations</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(2) it can be explained in terms of a rational model.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The key questions you should be asking the Utah scientists
center on these two principles.Â  So letÂ’s put these principles to work for you,
the Utah state legislator. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To begin, letÂ’s ask the Utah scientists:Â  Â“Do you have
reliable, reproducible observations?Â”Â  Of course, if they say Â“Yes,Â” then where
do you go from there?Â  Do you simply have to take their word for it?Â  The
answer is: Â“No, you donÂ’t.Â”Â  There are well-established procedures for checking
first the reliability, then the reproducibility of scientific observations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, reliability:Â  the normal procedure for disseminating
new research is by publication in peer-reviewed journals.Â  Now whatÂ’s this peer
review business?Â  When a scientist sends in her manuscript to a journal to be
published, the editor of the journal sends it out to other scientists to
check.Â  If the paper passes muster, it is published.Â  If not, it must be
revised or rejected.Â  Once the paper is published in a peer-reviewed journal,
it has the equivalent of a scientific Good Housekeeping seal of approval.Â  <i>You</i>
may not be able to read and understand the paper yourself as a layman, but you
at least have the assurance of knowing that other scientists have read it and
approved it.Â  One caveat, however: Not all scientific journals are
peer-reviewed.Â  How can you know which is which?Â  Ask a friendly university
professor, or consult that font of all modern wisdom, the Internet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Peer reviewÂ—this is the first point on which things started
to go seriously wrong in the cold fusion story.Â  In a panic to secure priority
for patent rights, the University of Utah bypassed the peer-review process, and
instead went straight to the public and announced their discovery in a press
conference.Â  Does this mean their scientific claims were false?Â  Absolutely
not!Â  But where no peer review occurred, you, as a lay legislator, do not have
the assurance that peer-review would normally provide.Â  A red flag should go up
in your mindÂ—these claims may be riding on thin ice.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So much for reliability.Â  How about reproducibility?Â  When
we talk about reproducibility, weÂ’re talking about two different types:Â  within
the lab, from experiment to experiment, and between different labs.Â  In
science, we know we really understand a phenomenon if we make the same
observation every time we set the experiment up the same way.Â  And our
confidence is significantly bolstered if someone in another lab can do the
same.Â  Short of that, we really donÂ’t understand, and indeed we may be way off
base.Â  Of course, numerical measurements may vary from one measurement to the
next, but they should be close.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, the next question we want to ask the Utah scientists
is:Â  Are your observations reproducible from experiment to experiment.Â  And
hereÂ’s another red flag:Â  the results were all over the map.Â  Sometimes the
Utah cells produced a little energy, sometimes a lot, sometimes none.Â 
Sometimes they seemed to produce particles or gamma rays, which are the natural
byproducts of nuclear reactions, and sometimes not.Â  Does this mean their
scientific claims were false?Â  Absolutely not!Â  But it does mean that they did
not have a clear understanding of what was going on.Â  HmmÂ—the ice seems to be
getting thinner!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a follow-up, weÂ’re going to ask about the second part:Â 
Are your observations reproduced by groups elsewhere?Â  Uh-oh!Â  At the time of
the press conference, no one else had been able to try to reproduce their
results because almost no one else knew about them.Â  By the time the
legislators were asked for the $5M, a few groups had tried; there were a few
tantalizing claims of success, but most groups had failed, and none of the work
had been published in the peer-reviewed literature.Â  WeÂ’re really on thin ice
now.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Okay, letÂ’s stop and take stock.Â  So far, weÂ’ve covered just
the first of our two fundamental principles, namely Â“Is the claim supported by
reliable, reproducible observations?Â”Â  Things arenÂ’t looking so good on that
score, IÂ’m afraid.Â  What about the other one, Â“Can the claim be explained in
terms of a rational model?Â”Â  Now just for clarification, you would be perfectly
justified in asking at this point, Â“What is a model, and what determines if it
is rational?Â”Â  Those are good questions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">LetÂ’s talk about models.Â  Einstein once said:Â  Â“The most
incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.Â”Â 
ThatÂ’s a profound thought.Â  Nature follows certain regular patterns, and
scientists describe these patterns in the form of models.Â  A model is a mental
construct or picture which attempts to describe the features of a system.Â  If
this sounds as clear as verbiage from an insurance contract, let me give you a
simple example.Â  At one time, the model of the atom was that the electrons
circle the nucleus like the planets circle the sun.Â  From this model, you can
get a mental picture of how this system (the atom) behaves. Now we donÂ’t
believe in this model any moreÂ—models come and go.Â Â  But notice that the model
often describes the system in terms of another system that is more familiarÂ—the
atom is <i>like</i> the solar system.Â Â Â  Today, we accept a more complicated
model for the atomÂ—but thatÂ’s a subject for another day.Â  The point is that
this model, like the one that succeeded it, is rational in that it is based on
accepted principles and built up using reason and logic. Scientists have
painstakingly developed numerous models over the years that have become widely
accepted.Â  It is expected that most new scientific observations will fit
within, that is correspond with, these accepted models.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Every once in a long while some new observations come along
which donÂ’t fit the accepted model.Â  When that happens, scientists are caught
short.Â  Could the observations be flawed?Â  That is always the first possibility
to check.Â  If not, then maybe the model needs to be modified, or an entirely
new model needs to be developed.Â  The latter involves what we call a revolution
in science.Â  Examples include the development of quantum mechanics (which, by
the way, replaced the Â“solar systemÂ” model of the atom), the germ theory of
disease, special and general relativity, and plate tectonics.Â Â  But these kinds
of revolutions are successful only when the amount of evidence is so
overwhelming that changing the model is the only alternative.Â  As the
astrophysicist Carl Sagan put it:Â  Â“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary
proofs.Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the questions about a system that a model often tries
to answer has to do with cause and effect.Â  We see an effectÂ—for example, the
sun coming up in the morning.Â  What causes it?Â  Well, you may have noticed that
the rooster crows just before sunupÂ—maybe thatÂ’s the cause.Â  But of course, you
say, letÂ’s not be naÃ¯ve: not all events that precede the effect cause the
effect.Â  But not all cases are quite so simple, and sometimes we can
misinterpret causes just this way.Â  Consider this:Â  The ancient pharaohs used
to throw a written command into the Nile River every year to cause the river to
floodÂ—and it did!Â  Of course, it was helpful that the local priesthood kept
records going back hundreds of years showing when the regular flooding of the
Nile occurred.Â  The ancient Egyptians saw the effect; they saw a plausible
cause and believed it.Â  Silly them.Â  Of course, we wouldnÂ’t be so gullible
today, would we?Â  Or would we?Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the late 1990Â’s there was an international scare that
high-tension power lines cause cancer.Â  The media spread the word based on
scanty preliminary evidence.Â  It was easy to believe:Â  some people living near
power lines were getting cancer.Â  The effect was clearÂ—cancer.Â  The presence of
the power lines preceded the cancer.Â  Ergo, the lines must be causing cancer.Â 
No one seemed to notice that there was no plausible scientific model to explain
how the power lines could cause cancer.Â  Exhaustive research was conducted,
with careful controls, on thousands of individuals.Â  Meanwhile, property values
of homes near power lines plummeted.Â  And what did the exhaustive research
studies yield?Â  No cause-effect relationship. The federal government estimates
that the loss in property values over this problem, coupled with the cost of
massive research into the question, was over $25BÂ—all over what turned out to
be a false alarm.Â  Yet the impression that such a cause-effect relationship
exists still lingers.Â  In fact, I bet if you ask your aunts and uncles around
the Thanksgiving dinner table next week if power lines cause cancer, some will
still be under the impression that there is a connection.Â  In some
circumstances, we are just as quick to believe non-existent cause-effect
relationships, as were the ancient Egyptians.Â  ItÂ’s just human nature.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the standard ways to test cause and effect is to
perform what we call baseline or control experiments.Â  These experiments are
extremely important, because they can identify false cause-effect leads. For
example, if someone claims a pill will cure your ill, you do an experiment to
see what would happen if you administered a sugar pill in its place.Â  Such
control studies are often done Â“blindÂ”; that is, no one in the study, not the
doctor, not the patient, knows whether the patient is taking the sugar pill or
the real thing.Â  If the sugar pill does just as well as the medicine, then
clearly the medicine is not the cause of the cure.Â  Control experiments like
this are critical to a claim like cold fusion, as we shall see.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In fact, we need to get back to our cold fusion story: As
good legislators, letÂ’s ask the Utah scientists about the second major
criterion of credible claims:Â  Can your claim be explained in terms of a
rational model?Â  HereÂ’s the answer they gave: We see enormous amounts of heat
in our cells.Â  We canÂ’t account for the heat from a chemical reaction.Â  What
other kind of reaction could be causing it?Â  The only other alternative is a
nuclear reaction.Â  The effect is clearÂ—heat.Â  The cause <i>must</i> be
nuclear.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Okay, letÂ’s consider this proposed cause-effect
relationship.Â  First, what about control experiments?Â Â  It turns out that the
Utah fusion was being done with so-called heavy waterÂ—that is water made not
from normal hydrogen atoms, but hydrogen atoms with an extra neutron in the
nucleus.Â  It has been known for a long time that heavy hydrogen like this can
undergo fusion by known fusion processes, although only at very high
temperature.Â  But there is no known model for normal hydrogen to undergo
fusion.Â  So, we should ask our university delegation:Â  What happened when you
performed the cold fusion experiment with normal water instead of heavy water?Â 
The logic is that if you also got heat in this case, it would point to a
non-nuclear cause to the heat effect.Â  Woops.Â Â  It turns out that the Utah
scientists didnÂ’t think to perform such basic control experiments before the
press conference.Â  I think the ice is starting to crack under these cold fusion
claims.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well, control experiments aside, letÂ’s get back to our basic
question:Â  Can the high-level cold fusion claims be explained in terms of a
rational model? Beyond the lack of control experiments, we have an even more
serious problem.Â  All known fusion reactions of the sort proposed by Pons and
Fleischmann produce particles or rays which can be measuredÂ—neutrons or protons
or gamma rays, tritium or helium. The current Â“modelÂ” of fusion requires them.Â 
And at the high level of reaction they claimed, there should have been enormous
numbers of particlesÂ—easy to measureÂ—so many in fact, that the researchers
should have been seriously injured if present in the lab.Â  But in fact, these
byproducts were either entirely missing or could not be found in nearly enough
quantity to correspond to their heat measurements.Â  WhatÂ’s the answer?Â  Well,
there must be a kind of fusion occurring that has never been seen before.Â  Is
this possible?Â  Of course it is!Â  Is it probable?Â  Well, we need to go back to
what we learned about replacing one model with a new one. ThatÂ’s what weÂ’re
being asked to do isnÂ’t it?Â  WeÂ’re being asked to consider replacing the
currently accepted model of fusion with a new one that can account for this
cold fusion result.Â  But Â“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proofs.Â”Â 
Do we have extraordinary proofs?Â  That is, do we have huge quantities of
overwhelmingly reliable evidence?Â  Not really.Â  And thatÂ’s really very
disturbing.Â  I think the ice just broke out from under the feet of these cold
fusion claims.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Keep in mind that all weÂ’ve said so far was not designed to
answer the question Â“Is cold fusion possible?Â”Â  Even after all these inquiries
on our part, itÂ’s still possible that cold fusion actually occurs.Â  WouldnÂ’t it
be nice if we could just leave it there and be philosophical about the whole
thing?Â  YesÂ… but <i>you</i> canÂ’t.Â  YouÂ’re in the Utah state legislature,
remember?Â  You have to make an intelligent, informed decision about the $5M
youÂ’ve been asked for.Â  YouÂ’d be wise to make that decision not on the basis of
whether economically viable cold fusion is <i>possible</i>, but on the basis of
whether it is <i>probable</i>.Â  And on this basis, these claims donÂ’t have much
going for them.Â  NowÂ… you might say, the stakes are <i>so high</i>Â—and it is at
least <i>possible</i>Â—so letÂ’s go for it.Â  But is this approach any better than
shoving money into a high stakes slot machine in Las Vegas? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In fact, the question is often raised when a new miracle
cure or infinite energy device is promoted:Â  IsnÂ’t it <i>possible</i> that all
the scientists are wrong and that there is a new, as yet undiscovered principle
behind this miraculous device?Â  The answer is: Â“ThatÂ’s the wrong question.Â” Of
course anything is possible.Â  I ask you:Â  IsnÂ’t it possible that Elvis is
really alive and sitting in the audience here today?Â  Sure.Â  But I donÂ’t see
any of you looking around to find him.Â  The correct question is, Â“Is it
probable?Â”Â  And thatÂ’s a horse of a different color.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well, as it turns out, the Utah legislature did give the
University of Utah its $5M.Â  Maybe they just felt in a Las Vegas mood.Â  Or
maybe they did what many good people are prone to doÂ—trust the experts and not
ask too many questionsÂ—Why not?Â  IsnÂ’t that what experts are for?Â  Let me
assure you that this whole story is not meant to criticize the good people of
the Utah State legislature.Â Â  Remember, even many scientists were ready to
accept the University of Utah claims, which just goes to show that having a PhD
after oneÂ’s name does not render him infallible.Â Â  If there is a moral to this
story it is that you, I, everyone should be prepared to ask questions, even of
experts, and that where science-based claims are concerned, there are some key
questions that must always be asked.Â  Among these are the questions weÂ’ve
talked about today.Â  Asking these questions wonÂ’t make you 100% immune from
voodoo science, but they will go a long way to help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, in future, when you are faced with a science-based
claim, think back to the two fundamental principles weÂ’ve talked about today.Â 
When someone claims to have magnets that will soften your water or clean your
clothes because the magnets affect the structure of water, what should you
ask?Â  May I suggest, first:Â  Can you show me reliable, reproducible
observations that support the claim?Â  I can tell the data are reliable if they
are published in a peer-reviewed journal.Â  DonÂ’t show me testimonials of
satisfied customersÂ—thatÂ’s not an acceptable means to support scientific
claims.Â  Show me hard data.Â  Second, can you show me that your product works
according to the currently accepted models of magnetism and water chemistry, or
else show me the overwhelming peer-reviewed evidence needed to overturn those
currently accepted models?Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Likewise, when cousin Egbert tries to sell you a new dietary
supplement that will cure your asthma, ask the right questions:Â  Can you show
me the evidence, supported by reliable control experiments using double-blind
methods, which unequivocally prove that the stuff actually works? Can you show
me the logical mechanism by which this product affects my body?Â  These
questions are especially important when someone is encouraging you to swallow
something or apply it to your body in some way.Â  A lot of health products you
can buy off the shelf have never undergone serious testing.Â Â  Of course,
careful testing of new drugs under the direction of qualified specialists is
something we can and should support.Â  But donÂ’t allow yourself to be
inadvertently turned into a human lab rat to prove or disprove the efficacy of
an untested treatment introduced directly into the marketplace.Â  Better to ask
first and partake afterÂ—inform yourself by asking the right questions. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now while IÂ’m dealing out gratuitous advice, I donÂ’t want to
leave out my good friends and colleagues in science education.Â  You know, we
science educators have to accept some of the blame when people fall victim to
voodoo science.Â  In our classrooms, we tend to dwell too much on the facts of
science, and we too often teach students to solve problems of a type they will
never see again in their lives. We expend far too little effort teaching
students how to solve the kinds of problems they <i>will</i> encounter later in
lifeÂ—problems like how to distinguish reliable scientific claims from
unreliable ones.Â  Maybe we ought to take a hard look at our priorities, because
I believe we can do a much better job of preparing students for the serious
science-related challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well, thereÂ’s a lot more we could discuss on this topic, but
my time is up. And as Mark Twain would say, Â“ItÂ’s a terrible death to be talked
to death.Â” Wait, thoughÂ—is cold fusion voodoo science or not?Â  I guess in part
that question depends on whether youÂ’re talking about cold fusion ala
University of Utah, or cold fusion ala BYU.Â  Hopefully after these few minutes
weÂ’ve spent together, youÂ’re in a better position to make up your own mind on
both counts, and to avoid many of the pins that can prick the unwary when
voodoo science of whatever sort comes to call.Â  Meanwhile, there is still a
small band of scientists who believe cold fusion is possible, at least at the
very low levels claimed all along by Jones at BYU.Â  Indeed, Steve Jones is
still working away quietly on cold fusion to this very day.Â  It will be
interesting to see if he or someone else can answer all the right questions and
come up with something truly wonderful.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It's wonderful to be back on this campus.  We miss you!  So much has happened since Steve and
I left just over six short years ago.  We salute all of you, the Bednars, the entire campus and an
inspired Board of Trustees for the continuing progress and development of BYU-Idaho.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I feel deep gratitude for the unforgettable and priceless experiences we shared with you during
the special season in our lives at Ricks College.   You are some of the finest people on earth.  As
much as we love our new setting, new friends and campus, we realize this institution is one of a
kind.  Many remarkable events occurred in our lives during our time here and still continue at
BYU-I.  Thank you for the priceless memories.  They are never to be forgotten!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Throughout our journey in life we each witness extraordinary circumstances, fortuitous events or
personal miracles that affirm our Heavenly Father's presence in our daily lives.  Sometimes we
think of them merely as coincidences, but when we examine them more closely, they become
awe-inspiring testimonials that God is very involved in our lives.  At such times we may not
even be aware that God is tapping us on the shoulder, so to speak, or carrying us upon His back,
but in retrospect we can definitely see His hand, his presence in our everyday affairs.  We then
know that we are truly God's children and that He is with us on our journey. </span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>&#8216;My beloved brethren, have miracles ceased because Christ hath ascended into
heaven?&#8217;</i> asked Mormon, and then he answers his own question.  &#8216;<i>Behold, I say
unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that miracles are wrought;...wherefore, if these
things have ceased wo be unto the children of men, for it is because of unbelief...&#8217; 
</i>(Moroni 7:27,37)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Moroni proclaimed, <i>"Behold, I will show unto you a god of miracles,...and it is that same God
who created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are"</i> (Mormon 9:11).  <i>"God is
the same yesterday, today, and forever, and in him is no variableness..."</i> (Mormon 9:9).  I
believe God is a God of miracles today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ on earth in this dispensation is a magnificent
miracle.  It began when young Joseph, prompted by a passage in the Epistle of James, went into
the woods to pray.  A God of miracles answered Joseph's humble prayer.  And miracles followed
including the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the establishment of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">These magnificent miracles are the reason we gather together tonight.  However, just as
important as these magnificent miracles, are the smaller "personal miracles" that occur in each of
our lives.  They teach us to have faith and trust in the Lord.  They come as we recognize and
heed the quiet promptings of the Holy Spirit.  The Holy Ghost is a revelator, a teacher,
comforter, lifts burdens, gives courage, strengthens faith, grants consolation, extends hope and
reveals whatever is needed to those having claim on his sacred companionship through baptism
(Moses 6:61).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">These are promises of miracles granted by a gracious God who loves us and seeks to bless us
from day to day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Each week we have the opportunity to partake of the sacrament and renew our covenants.  We
are promised the Lord's Spirit will always be with us as we keep those covenants (Doctrine and
Covenants 20:77,79).  A natural consequence of the companionship of the Spirit is a continuing
series of small miracles--whisperings of protection and guidance, strengthened and renewed
testimonies, comfort and peace, gifts of love and joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I believe each of us has experienced extraordinary circumstances or small personal miracles that
let us know the Lord is near.  At times various events, seeming insignificant, sometimes line up
in fortuitous fashion, to bring about a wonderful result.  I believe as we try to live as we know
we should, we will find that we truly are God's children and His Spirit is always with us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In thinking about tonight's topic, I've decided to share some personal experiences.  I do so
humbly and not in a spirit of boasting or arrogance.  Perhaps what I share will prompt you to
closely examine your past with new eyes and recognize the personal miracles that have taken
place in your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It was the spring of 1978.  The preceding nine years had been extremely busy for our family. 
Steve held a full time job and had just launched into a PhD program when he was called to be the
bishop of our ward in Madison, Wisconsin.  Needless to say, the call was a surprise at age 29,
but there was not a moment's hesitation as to whether he would accept the Lord's call.  Thus, the
advanced degree was placed on hold.  Three more children blessed our home making a total of
four sons and one daughter.  The last two children were eighteen months apart, and we were a
very busy family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">After five years Steve was released as bishop and once again he pursued his desired PhD. 
Indescribable emotion and joy filled my soul during graduation as I observed the light blue hood
being placed on his shoulders.  We had juggled and worked so hard during those very busy
years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">It had been a long, long time since Steve and I had been away alone together on an overnight
retreat.  One day while visiting the Madison Art Gallery I noted an advertisement of an amateur
art sale being held in Milwaukee the following Saturday.  I called Steve, asked him to check his
schedule and then suggested we have some R and R&#8212;just the two of us.  We found a competent
sitter for the children and left late Friday afternoon.  What a treat to be with Steve alone for
twenty-four hours!  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">That evening we had dinner at a favorite German restaurant.  We walked and talked and enjoyed
our precious time alone together.   It was spring.  The trees were budding, the crocuses
blooming.  This time of year represented renewal, renewal of life.  We, too, felt renewed and
invigorated.  I remember I had a difficult time going to sleep that night, wondering about things
at home and hoping our precious children would be well cared for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The following morning as we prepared to leave our hotel the phone rang.  It was our oldest son,
Donnie.  He cried,  <i>&#8220;You must come home.  I think Brian is dead!&#8221;</i>  The nightmarish trip from
Milwaukee to Madison seemed much longer than 85 miles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Our three-year-old Brian had been taken home to our Heavenly Father.  I can't even begin to
express the anguish we felt.  He died in his sleep and showed no prior signs of being ill.  Brian
had been chasing ducks in the park only hours before.  And to think it was the only night Steve
and I had been away from our children for years. The grief, sorrow and loneliness we felt were
unreal. Only time has healed the intensity of our pain, although, it never completely goes away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Following Brian's death we felt a tremendous outpouring of the Lord's spirit and of His love. 
We literally felt encircled in His arms.  The Savior was carrying us and giving us strength.  The
great love and concern from friends and family combined with the power of prayer and faith in
the Gospel&#8217;s eternal plan gave us great sustenance.  We were, indeed, blessed to have Brian as
long as we did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A month and a half following Brian's death I, along with several friends, attended a Women's
Conference in Nauvoo, Illinois.  I was so hoping to find added perspective and peace.  Our
Prophet Spencer W. Kimball and other great leaders spoke but I failed to find the comfort I was
desperately seeking.  On our final day in Nauvoo I met the wife of our former Church president,
Harold B. Lee.  During the course of our conversation she repeated the following quote made by
her husband:  <i>"Where the Lord puts a period, never put a question mark!"</i>  This she said without
even knowing we had recently lost a child.  I realized this was what I came to Nauvoo for.  The
Lord had placed a period&#8212;Brian's mission in this life had been completed- of this we had had a
witness.  There was purpose and reason for what had happened--the purpose we would not
totally understand until the next life.  I felt Sister Lee's comment, <i>"Where the Lord puts a period,
never put a question mark,"</i> was the answer to my prayers, a personal miracle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A beloved friend, Dr. Robert Andrew, wrote a beautiful letter following Brian&#8217;s death.  He said, </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>There can be no room for doubt that Brian was summoned home.  He died of
&#8216;natural causes,&#8217; yes; this is how the Lord does things.  But taking him in this
way, a way painless to him, may have required that his mother be away, for she
was given more than the usual alertness and motherly awareness.  Along with
these strong instincts, the resourcefulness of his devoted parents probably would
have interfered with his peaceful passing.  His ever spiritually alert father,
bearing the Holy Priesthood, would have been a serious challenge to that which
was ordained.  Would the angels who attended this sunny child have been able to
resist the entreaties of Brian&#8217;s parents?  It is a serious and sober question.</i> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Steve and I can honestly say we are grateful for our <i>"Celestial Link"</i> to Brian.  We are, without a
doubt, grateful to have had our son on earth for <i>"but one brief shining moment,"</i> but more
grateful to know that the celestial life is the important life and there we will have him forever, if
we do our part.  There comes a time when grief and longing are replaced by the excitement of
anticipating a reunion with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In spite of our loss there were many personal miracles and extraordinary circumstances that
occurred during this period of time that let us know without a shadow of doubt that our Savior
was with us and aware of what we were experiencing.  Most of all, we learned Gospel principles
and precepts we needed to learn.  We realized the Spirit has power to communicate in ways we
do not understand. Today, I am most grateful to my Father in Heaven to have had this profound,
life changing experience.  The interruption of our joyous association with our son has deep
meaning.  Truly, it has strengthened our sense of gratitude for, dependence on, and love for our
Heavenly Father.  We have greater understanding of the sacrifice of our Savior and of his
atonement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A little under seven years ago Steve and I and our family were living in Rexburg, serving at
Ricks College.  We loved our time here.  Our memories are sweet and will remain with us
forever.  We truly felt God's hand in our coming to Rexburg--to us a personal miracle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">We had been here eight years when Steve was nominated and approached to apply for the
presidency of Southern Utah University in Cedar City, Utah.  We responded with, <i>"We are
honored, but no thank you."</i>  Over the next few weeks we received two additional phone calls
inviting us to reconsider the opportunity.  After further reflection we felt we would not be at
Ricks much longer.  We realized, regardless of our own wishes our time here was nearing the
end, and we had stayed longer than our three predecessors.  Steve visited with Elder Henry B.
Eyring, who had also been contacted about Steve's candidacy.  After much prayer we decided to
push forward with both faith and trepidation, wanting to do the Lord's will.  President Hinckley
told Steve, <i>"You go with our blessing or you stay at Ricks with our blessing."</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">As we began to investigate Southern Utah University, we were reminded that Steve's own
grandfather, Milton Bennion, had been appointed the very first president, the first principal
exactly 100 years before.  It was almost unbelievable.  At that time it was called the Branch
Normal School.  The more we explored the more at peace we became.  Steve was selected as
president by the Utah State Board of Regents.  I think it was significant, in the university's
centennial year, to have the grandson of the first founding president become the president
ushering in the second century.  So, we left for Cedar City in June of 1997.  Was this an
extraordinary coincidence?  Yes.  Was this an answer to prayer?  Yes.  Was it a personal miracle
in our lives?  Yes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Another experience:  One day while rearranging my genealogy cupboard, I glanced at a family
group sheet and noted that my great grandfather had been born in Cedar City in 1855.  I had no
idea my ancestors had settled and lived in that part of the state. I wondered what brought my
great-great grandparents, Charles and Mary Ann Hopkins, to this area.  When did they come? 
Why did they come?  How long did they live here?  Then I pushed the genealogy sheet back into
the cupboard and didn't think much more about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Months later, while reading a local history, I learned that Charles Hopkins had been a member of
Parley P. Pratt's Exploring Expedition to Southern Utah in 1849.  In 1853, he moved his family
to Cedar City to become an Iron Work's missionary.  He served as one of the twelve High
Counselors in the new Cedar Stake of Zion.  In her book on the Mountain Meadows Massacre,
Juanita Brooks mentions Charles Hopkins.  All this information stimulated my interest and I
decided I was in the right place at the right time to research a story that needed to be told, one I
learned had never been told.  Once I began to search for information it seemed to fall into my
lap.  As I started to write I could hardly lay it down.  Was all this a mere coincidence?  I don't
think so.  The "Spirit of Elijah" is real and family history is an exciting adventure.  Could the
Lord possibly have wanted my grandfather's story to be told?  I know Family History miracles
are an everyday occurrence in the Church.  My heart has certainly been turned to my great-great
grandparents and I have truly been guided in my search to write their history.  I bear witness, as
I'm sure many of you can, to the truthfulness of the gospel charge to search out our ancestors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">I'd like to share another experience when fortuitous events lined up to bring about a wonderful
result:  Sandra Griffin Hardy and I met at a board meeting of the Guild of the Utah
Shakespearean Festival in Cedar City, Utah soon after our arrival.  She was our well-organized,
enthusiastic president.  <i>&#8220;Can you and your husband help me?&#8221;</i> she asked following one of our
meetings.  Then she began to share a very personal and timely story--personal because it
involved her ancestor, William Weeks; timely because President Gordon B. Hinckley had just
announced in April Conference of 1999, that the Church would soon begin reconstruction of the
Nauvoo Temple.  </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>&#8216;I am a great-great granddaughter of William Weeks, architect of the old Nauvoo
Temple,&#8217;</i> Sandra said.  <i>&#8216;The original temple drawings had been in my family for
about 100 years when my grandparents, Leslie and Zetta Griffin, gave them to the
Church in 1948.  I am not certain we were acknowledged as the family who
donated in returned the plans.  Of even more importance to us is that the
drawings were the name of my deceased uncle, Ralph Henry Griffin who died in a
mining accident at age 20.  He, too, was an artist.  Could you help us learn what
happened?&#8217;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">To understand the difficulty of the Griffin's situation let me take you back to April of 1843,
when the Prophet Joseph Smith said, <i>&#8220;I gave a certificate to William Weeks to carry out my
designs and the architecture of the Temple in Nauvoo.&#8221;<sup>1</sup></i>  Brother Weeks had been handpicked to
create the design the Prophet had seen in vision.  The temple was to be built on a bluff in a
central and elevated position where it could be seen from the majestic Mississippi River and
from every part of town.  In February of 1844, the Prophet and Brother Weeks met to discuss the
temple plans.  <i>&#8220;I wish you to carry out my designs.  I have seen in vision the splendid
appearance of that building illuminated, and will have it built according to the pattern shown
me.&#8221;<sup>2</sup></i>  Thus, Brother Weeks began to create what the prophet had seen in vision as the Nauvoo
Temple.  Immediately the construction began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In February of 1846, Brigham Young asked William and Caroline Allen Weeks and their family
to begin the long, arduous journey to the Great Salt Lake Valley.  President Young wanted
William in one of the initial groups of Saints so that the architect could commence plans for
another temple as soon as they reached the valley.<sup>3</sup> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">After spending the winter of 1846-47 in Winter Quarters, the Weeks family made their way
west, arriving in Salt Lake that fall.  Unfortunately, the architect became openly discontent with
the Church during his first weeks in the valley.  Causes of his alienation are not known.  He
evidentially left the Church and the Salt Lake Valley to settle in southern California.  With him
he took the original plans of the Nauvoo Temple. His daughter, Caroline, wrote in her father's
obituary, <i>&#8220;Despite his separation from Mormonism, William remained a great admirer of Joseph
Smith.  He regarded the Nauvoo edifice as his masterpiece; taking pride in exhibiting his Temple
drawings to friends and visitors in later years until his death on March 8, 1900."<sup>4</sup></i>  Caroline
preserved the plans and later gave them to her son, Leslie M. Griffin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The story of how the plans returned to the Church is a most fascinating one.  In 1948, a young
missionary from Heber City, Utah, Elder Vern Thacker, was transferred to the little town of
Boron, CA in the Mojave Desert.  While there he and his companion knocked on the door of the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Leslie M. Griffin, who graciously greeted them.  Mr. Griffin was not a
member of the Church but told the missionaries he was a grandson of William Weeks, the
architect of the <i>&#8220;old Mormon temple in Nauvoo, Illinois.&#8221;<sup>5</sup></i>  The elders developed a good
relationship with the Griffin family and held several gospel discussions.  Elder Thacker related: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>On our last visit to Mr. Griffin he excused himself for a few minutes and went into the rear part
of his house.  He returned with a large roll of papers about four feet long, ten inches in diameter,
secured with a rubber band.  He explained, &#8216;These are the original architect&#8217;s drawings for the
Nauvoo Temple.  They have been in my family for 100 years, handed down from my grandfather,
William Weeks.&#8217;  He then unrolled the plans and explained them to us. There were exterior
drawings, some interior, an angel with a weather vane, pencil sketches for circular stairways,
circular windows, archways, etc.  Even the measurements for various details of the temple were
included in William&#8217;s handwriting. They were yellowed with age but in amazingly good
condition.  Mr. Griffin knew I was returning home in a few days.  He asked me if I would do him
a favor of carrying these plans to the headquarters of the Church in Salt Lake City.  I assured
him that it would be a great honor for me to do so.  He said he felt that, after 100 years, these
should be given to the Church.  I subsequently left Boron with the plans tucked into the turtle
back trunk of my Ford.<sup>6</sup></i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">One week after returning from his mission, Thacker made an appointment with A. William
Lund, Assistant LDS Church Historian, and turned the drawings over to him.  A short time later,
Mr. Griffin received a letter of thanks from Lund, dated September 28, 1948.  The letter states,
<i>&#8220;We appreciate your action far more than words can express.&#8221;<sup>7</sup></i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In 1949, 19 year-old Leslie Marion Griffin, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Jr</span>., Sandra's father, was baptized a member of the
Church, the first descendant of the William Weeks family to join.  Eventually, his wife, Jo Lee,
their daughter, Sandra, and her husband, James Hardy, became members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Sometime during the mid 1980&#8217;s the family read in a Church publication that someone other
than their family had donated the original Nauvoo Temple plans to the Church.  This surprised
and confused the Griffins and Hardys.  At that time Sandra wrote the Church Historical
Department for clarification.  She received a letter, dated August 12, 1985, stating, <i>&#8220;The original
drawings of the Nauvoo Temple <span style="text-decoration: underline">may</span> have been donated by your grandparents.&#8221;<sup>8</sup></i>  This further
disheartened the family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Steve and I made two inquiries concerning Sandra&#8217;s request back in 1999.  Then as a result of a
startling coincidence the story of the return of Weeks&#8217; architectural plans by Elder Vern Thacker
was shared in a Sacrament Meeting talk by someone who knew nothing of the Griffin's
connection.  This led to other coincidences and many telephone calls.  Sandra, at last, had
located Brother Vern Thacker.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The momentum of the drama began to build on March 23, 2001, during breakfast with Elder
David E. Sorensen (who offered the dedicatory prayer for a new building on Southern Utah
University's campus in Cedar City).  Elder Sorensen serves in the Presidency of the Seventy and
was and is over the Church Temple Department.  He shared with those of us at his table the latest
developments in the rebuilding of the Nauvoo Temple.  This topic of conversation was of
particular importance to two people, seated at our table, who were the primary donors to the
temple reconstruction whose names I will not say.  Elder Sorensen related the story of the return
of William Weeks&#8217; architectural drawings, noting that the current architects were using these
original plans.  Then he stated, he knew of no Weeks&#8217; descendants who are now Church
members.  Excitedly, I said, <i>&#8220;Elder Sorensen, you won&#8217;t believe this!  I heard this story from
William Weeks&#8217; great-great granddaughter herself.  She <span style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> a member of the Church.  Sandra
Hardy and her parents live right here in Cedar City.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>&#8220;I would love to meet these people,&#8221;</i> exclaimed Elder Sorensen and the excitement began to
mount.  Les Griffin, his wife, Jo Lee, and their daughter, Sandra, met with Elder Sorensen that
afternoon, bringing with them letters and photocopies of the original drawings.  Elder Sorensen
invited the family to visit him in his office in Salt Lake City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">In late spring of 2001, the Griffins, their daughter Sandra, along with Brother Vern Thacker, his
wife, Suzanne, Steve and I, went to Salt Lake City.  Elder Sorensen warmly welcomed us.  He
took us to meet with Brother Scott Christensen of the Church Archives.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Brother Christensen brought out a large rectangular box containing the architectural drawings of
their great grandfather.  Wearing white protective gloves, Les Griffin once again viewed the
drawings he had seen many times as a child.  On one of the pages he found a watercolor drawing
of a boat he had drawn in the early 1940&#8217;s when he could find no other paper on which to paint. 
Near his watercolor his older brother, Ralph, had sketched a ship with mast and sails.  Tears
welled up in Les's eyes, and he said, <i>&#8220;My brother was killed in a mine accident when he was 20. 
These temple plans were to have been donated in his name.&#8221;</i>  Brother Christensen then handed
him a copy from the Church Archives&#8217; records stating that, yes, William Weeks&#8217; architectural
designs had been contributed in the name of Ralph Henry Griffin.  All present were now
weeping and overcome with emotion.  Les smiled through his tears, gave a sigh of relief, and
peace and pleasure filled his face.  Sandra turned to me and we hugged, cried, and hugged some
more.  What an exhilarating, joyous occasion!   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">The Griffins brought with them the Weeks&#8217; Family Bible and gave it to the Church. William&#8217;s
own handwriting gave the dates of family births, marriages, and deaths.  Brother Christensen
said, <i>&#8220;This Bible is a treasure because of Weeks&#8217; unique role in Church history.&#8221;</i>  The family
also donated, that April day, a picture Ralph had copied from William&#8217;s drawing of the temple&#8217;s
front entrance, dated March 1, 1941.  Ralph had used a piece of the same paper on which
William had completed his temple drawings.  Archivist Scott Christensen gratefully received
Ralph's drawing and the Bible because they confirmed the relationship between the Griffin
Family and William Weeks.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">William Weeks might find belated consolation in knowing that the rediscovery of his plans
through a series of minor miracles helped make it possible for the Church to rebuild and more
authentically replicate the reconstructed Nauvoo Temple.  It is by chance that the drawings
survived all of William's moves and finally ended up in LDS Archives as a result of Elder
Thacker's contact with the Griffin family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">One day when leaving the Church Archives after doing some research on William Weeks, I ran
into Elder Bruce C. Hafen.  <i>"Marj, what are you doing here?"</i> he asked.  I told him, and quickly
shared a little of the Weeks story.  He said, <i>"Just yesterday I was in a meeting with the Brethern. 
Bishop Keith B. McMullin, gave us a progress report on the Nauvoo Temple.  He said Weeks'
plans were crucial in the reconstruction.  Why don't you call Bishop McMullin's office and ask
for a quote from him?"</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">So I did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Bishop McMullin, a counselor in the Presiding Bishopric of the Church, shared the following
comments with me:  </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><i>In constructing the Nauvoo Temple, we gained a deep appreciation for the work
of Brother Weeks.  In rebuilding the Temple, efforts have been made to reflect as
closely as practical the original exterior designs and interior appointments. 
Brother Weeks' drawings were an essential part of this study and research.  The
manner in which the Nauvoo Temple has been reconstructed would not have been
possible without these original plans.<sup>9</sup></i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">A multitude of small miracles occurred as the family of architect William Weeks was
rediscovered:  Sandra&#8217;s prompting to ask for help, finding and reconnecting with Brother Vern
Thacker, and the unusual timing of the chance meeting with Elder David E. Sorensen whose
responsibility was temples.  The Church had acknowledged and recorded the Griffin's gift in the
name of a beloved brother.  They learned the whereabouts of Weeks&#8217; descendants, and that some
are Latter-day Saints.  These small miracles declared testimony and confirmation of God&#8217;s
presence in the lives of this dear family.  All the events brought profound meaning to those who
played a part in rediscovering the Weeks&#8217; family on the eve of the rebuilding of the Nauvoo
Temple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Isn't this a wonderful story?  I am so grateful to have played a minor part in its development. 
The Griffins and Sandra Hardy along with Steve and I attended the Nauvoo Temple open house. 
It was a glorious experience for them and for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt">Ours <span style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> a Gospel of miracles, of everyday spiritual experiences and blessings in the lives of the
Lord's people.  God manifests his power by giving us the constant companionship of the Holy
Ghost, a reminder that He is near and He loves us.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Many personal miracles or spiritual
experiences are too sacred to share.</span>  They are to be kept and pondered in one's heart or perhaps
told privately as prompted by the Spirit.  Yes, our Heavenly Father is a God of miracles today. 
True faith and obedience brings the fruits of the Spirit, the greatest of which is love.  As is often
the case in our daily lives, events and circumstances that seem so ordinary at the time of their
happening in retrospect take on deeper meaning.  As we look back over our lives we can
definitely see the Lord's hand, his presence in our everyday affairs.  We then know that we are
truly God's children and that He is with us on our journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:12pt"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Thank you</span> for inviting us back tonight.  I want you to know that I have a strong testimony of the
Lord's presence in our lives.  I know He lives and loves us.  I know Jesus Christ is our Savior,
our Redeemer and that He came to teach us and to atone for our sins. I am so grateful for the
years our family lived in Rexburg, for the rare privilege to serve with you on this campus and for
marvelous memories.</span></p>

</p>
<p>I am grateful to be here Brothers and Sisters.  I would like to share some of my thoughts and
feelings about receiving revelation.  I will use the scriptures, quotes from the prophets, and my
own experience to share my message with you.</p>
<p>First of all, if we were to chart revelation as a continuum, it might look something like this.  May
I suggest that the most indirect way of receiving revelation is through the Light of Christ, or what
the world would call our conscience.  Would you turn with me in your scriptures to Moroni 7:16-17.  It states,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good
from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which
inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ is sent forth by the power
and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.
But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and
deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of
the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to
do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject
themselves unto him.</i></p>
<p>As we follow the light of Christ we begin to develop what the Apostle Paul calls, &#8220;The Fruits of
the Spirit.&#8221;Galations 5:22-23 lists the fruits of the spirit as love, joy, long suffering, peace,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance.  As we progress on the continuum we
come to the next area called inspiration.  Inspiration can come in many ways.  Prayer, pure
intelligence, common sense, intuition, scriptures, a burning in the bosom, another person,
thoughts, and feelings are some examples of how revelation may come.  The next area on the
continuum is a dream.  Dreams happen when we are asleep.  In the Book of Mormon, Lehi is an
example of one who received  revelation through dreams.  Our next category is Mechanical
Devices.  These devices include the Urim and Thummim, the Liahona, a Seer Stone, and a staff
or rod.  A more direct way of receiving revelation is to actually hear a voice.  The prophet
Samuel is an example of one who heard an audible voice tell him to do something.  Our next
category is to experience a vision. A vision is both visible and audible.  Next is to actually have a
visitation.  Angels such as Moroni, Peter, James, and John, Moses, and Elijah appearing to the
Prophet Joseph Smith are examples of this.  The most direct way of receiving revelation from our
Heavenly Father is to experience a theophany, that is, to see God face to face.  Joseph Smith&#8217;s
First Vision is an example of this.</p>
<p>Regardless of the way revelation is received, there are some principles hat govern receiving
revelation.   I would like to share with you 8 principles that govern revelation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Principle #1 All members of the Church are entitled to receive Revelation.</span></p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the least Saint may know all things as fast as he is able to
bear them.  He taught the following,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>This principle ought (in its proper place) to be taught, for God hath not revealed
anything to Joseph, but what He will make known unto the Twelve, and even the
least Saint many know all things as fast as he is able to bear them, for the day
must come when no man need say to his neighbor, &#8216;Know ye the Lord; for all
shall know Him (who remain) from the least to the greatest.</i></p>
<p>All of us are entitled to receive revelation.  This is an important point to remember.  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Principle #2 You can not force Spiritual things.</span></p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer has taught this principle on many different occassions.  He has taught
the following,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i> It is not wise to wrestle with the revelations with such insistence as to demand
immediate answers or blessings to your liking.  You cannot force spiritual things.
Such words as compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand, do not describe our
privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you
can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before it&#8217;s time.  You can create a
climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel:
you must await the growth.  Do not be impatient to gain great spiritual
knowledge.  Let it grow, help it grow, but do not force it or you will open the way
to be misled.</i></p>
<p>&#160;As a religion teacher, there is nothing I would rather be able to do than to flip a switch in my
classroom and have the Spirit come into the room.  But, it doesn&#8217;t work that way.  As a class, we
can sing, we can pray, we can be reverent, we can be respectful, we can speak one at a time to
invite the Spirit, but we cannot force it to come.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Principle #3 The Lord decides where, how, and when Revelation is to come.</span></p>
<p>If you will turn with me in your scriptures to Doctrine and Covenants 88:68, it states,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the
days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it
shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will.</i></p>
<p>Notice the Lord says that He will answer us in His time, and in His way, not in our time, or in our
way.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Principle #4 The Spirit speaks to Spirit. </span> </p>
<p>President Joseph Fielding Smith taught that impressions that come to us from the Holy Ghost are
more difficult to erase than seeing a vision.  He said,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The question frequently arises: &#8216;Is it necessary for a member of the Council of the
Twelve to see the Savior in order to be an apostle?&#8217;  It is their privilege to see him
if occasion requires, but the Lord has taught that there is a stronger witness than
seeing a personage, even of seeing the Son of God in a vision.  Impressions on the
soul that come from the Holy Ghost are far more significant than a vision. When
Spirit speaks to Spirit, the imprint upon the soul is far more difficult to erase. 
Every member of the Church should have impressions that Jesus is the Son of God
indelibly pictured on his soul through the witness of the Holy Ghost.</i></p>
<p>Speaking of how the Spirit speaks to our Spirits, the Prophet Joseph Smith taught the following,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>All things whatsoever God in his infinite wisdom has seen fit and proper to reveal
to us, while we are dwelling in mortality, in regard to our mortal bodies are
revealed to us in the abstract, and independent of affinity of this mortal
tabernacle, but are revealed to our spirits precisely as though we had no bodies
at all; and those revelations which will save our spirits will save our bodies.</i></p>
<p>The idea that the Spirit communicates to our Spirit as if we had no bodies at all is intriguing.  On
another occasion, the Prophet Joseph Smith described this process using the word intelligence.
He taught the following,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for
instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden
strokes of ideas, so that by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or
soon; (i.e.) Those things that were presented unto your minds by the Spirit of God,
will come to pass; and thus learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you
may grow into the principle of revelation, until you become perfect in Christ
Jesus.</i></p>
<p>&#160;When I was a small boy I soon realized that many who bore their testimonies in Sacrament
meeting ended up crying.  I began to believe that if I had a testimony I should cry too.  I
remember wanting to cry when I bore my testimony.  It wasn&#8217;t until later in my life that I learned
the following about the relationship between tears and a testimony.  Alvin R. Dyer relates the
following incident he had with President Spencer W. Kimball.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>You don&#8217;t have to cry about the gospel to have a testimony!  Many times we think
that we don&#8217;t have a testimony unless a few tears flow.  Nothing could be further
from the truth.  It is not necessary or needful for a person to have tears streaming
down his face to have a testimony of the gospel.  I went to a meeting with Spencer
W. Kimball and a man got up and bore his testimony and he cried all the way
through it.  After the meeting, Brother Kimball called him over and said,
&#8216;Brother, I wish you&#8217;d stop crying when you bear your testimony.  You don&#8217;t have
to do that to tell the people you love the Lord.&#8217;</i></p>
<p>&#160;President Howard W. Hunter cautioned teachers in the Church Educational System to be careful
not to counterfeit the true influence of the Holy Ghost.  He taught the following,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Let me offer a word of caution on this subject.  I think if we are not careful as
professional teachers working in the classroom every day, we may begin to try to
counterfeit the true influence of the Spirit of the Lord by unworthy and
manipulative means.  I get concerned when it appears that strong emotion or free-flowing tears are equated with the presence of the Spirit.  Certainly the Spirit of
the Lord can bring strong emotional feelings, including tears, but that outward
manifestation ought not be confused with the presence of the Spirit itself.  I have
watched a great many of my brethren over the years and we have shared some
rare and unspeakable spiritual experiences together.  Those experiences have all
been different, each special in its own way, and such sacred moments may or may
not be accompanied by tears.  Very often they are, but sometimes they are
accompanied by total silence.  Other times they are accompanied by joy.  Always
they are accompanied by a great manifestation of the truth, of revelation to the
heart.  Give your students gospel truth powerfully taught; that is the way to give
them a spiritual experience.  Let it come naturally and as it will, perhaps with the
shedding of tears, but perhaps not.  If what you say is the truth, and you say it
purely and with honest conviction, those students will feel the spirit of the truth
being taught to them and will recognize that inspiration and revelation has come
into their hearts.  That is how we build faith.  That is how we strengthen
testimonies&#8211;with the power of the word of God taught in purity and with
conviction.</i></p>
<p>These teachings have helped me greatly in my own life and in my teaching as a religion instructor
for the past 22 years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Principle #5 Use your head&#8211;Use common sense.</span></p>
<p>Study it out in your mind.  The Lord expects us to use the brain he has given us.  He also expects
us to know what He has taught through his prophets.  He expects us to know what he has already
revealed to us about such issues as serving a mission, watching R- rated movies, dating, and
sexual purity.  He has already given us the answers to questions that might arise concerning these
or other issues.  The Prophet Joseph Smith taught,  <i>&#8220;We never inquire at the hand of God for
special revelation only in case of their being no previous revelation to suit the case.&#8221;</i>  Elder
Dallin H. Oaks tells the following story concerning this issue,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Spirit of the Lord is not likely to give us revelations on matters that are
trivial.  I once heard a young woman in a testimony meeting praise the spirituality
of her husband, indicating that he submitted every question to the Lord.  She told
how he accompanied her shopping and would not even choose between different
brands of canned vegetables without making his selection a matter of prayer. That
strikes me as improper.  I believe the Lord expects us to use the intelligence and
experience he has given us to make these kinds of choices.</i></p>
<p>Elder Oaks reminds us that there is not always a right and wrong answer to every question we
may take to the Lord.  He taught,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>I suggest that there is not a right and wrong to every question.  To many
questions, there are only two wrong answers or two right answers.  Thus, a
person who seeks guidance on which of two different ways he should pursue to get
even with a person who has wronged him is not likely to receive a revelation.
Neither is a person who seeks guidance on a choice he will never have to make
because some future event will intervene, such as a third alternative that is clearly
preferable...No answer is likely to come to a person who seeks guidance in
choosing between two alternatives that are equally acceptable to the Lord.  Thus,
there are times when we can serve productively in two different fields of labor.
Either answer is right.</i></p>
<p>&#160;We see this doctrine taught in the Doctrine and Covenants in Sections 60-62.  If you would turn
with me to Doctrine and Covenants 60:5 it states,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>But, verily, I will speak unto you concerning your journey unto the land from
whence you came.  Let there be a craft made, or bought, <span style="font-weight: bold">AS SEEMETH YOU
GOOD</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">IT MATTERETH NOT UNTO ME</span>, and take your journey speedily for
the place which is called St. Louis </i>(emphasis added).</p>
<p>Notice the phrase, <span style="font-weight: bold">IT MATTERETH NOT UNTO ME</span> in the following passages.  Please turn
with me to Doctrine and Covenants 61:22.  It reads,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And <span style="font-weight: bold">IT MATTERETH NOT UNTO ME</span>, after a little, if it so be that they fill
their mission, whether they go by water or by land; let this be as it is made known
unto them according to their judgments hereafter</i> (emphaisis added).</p>
<p>Please turn to Doctrine and Covenants 61:35.  It says, &#8220;And let them journey together, or two by
two, <span style="font-weight: bold">AS SEEMETH THEM GOOD</span>...&#8221; (Emphasis added)  Please turn to Doctrine and
Covenants 62:5.  The Lord says,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>And then you may return to bear record, yea, even altogether, or two by two, <span style="font-weight: bold">AS
SEEMETH YOU GOOD</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">IT MATTERETH NOT UNTO ME</span>; only be faithful,
and declare glad tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, or among the
congregations of the wicked... (emphasis added)</i></p>
<p>We can see from these passages that sometimes the Lord doesn&#8217;t care which choice we make. My
favorite quote in this regard is the following one by Elder Bruce R. McConkie.  He taught,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>How do you choose a wife?  I&#8217;ve heard a lot of young people from Brigham
Young University and elsewhere say, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got to get a feeling of inspiration.  I&#8217;ve
got to get some revelation.  I&#8217;ve got to fast and pray and get the Lord to manifest
to me whom I should marry.&#8217;  Well, maybe it will be a little shock to you, but
never in my life did I ever ask the Lord whom I ought to marry.  It never occurred
to me to ask him.  I went out and found the girl I wanted; she suited me; I
evaluated and weighed the proposition, and it just seemed a hundred percent to
me as though this ought to be.  Now, if I&#8217;d done things perfectly, I&#8217;d have done
some counseling with the Lord, which I didn&#8217;t do; but all I did was pray to the
Lord and ask for some guidance and direction in connection with the decision
that I&#8217;d reached.  A more perfect thing to have done would have been to counsel
with him relative to the decision and get a spiritual confirmation that the
conclusion, which I by my agency and faculties had arrived at, was the right one.</i></p>
<p>&#160;President Packer reminds us that the Spirit will give us promptings as we go about our every day
duties of life.  He taught the following,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Things of the Spirit need not - indeed, should not - require our uninterrupted time
and attention.  Ordinary work-a-day things occupy most of our attention.  And
that is as it should be.  We are mortal beings living in this physical world.
Spiritual things are like leavening.  By measure they may be very small, but by
influence they affect all that we do.</i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Principle #6 Revelation is Stewardship Bound.</span></p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that that there is stewardship involved in receiving revelation.
He said the following, <i>&#8220;I will inform you that it is contrary to the economy of God for any
member of the Church, or anyone, to receive instruction for those in authority, higher than
themselves...&#8221;</i>  Elder Dallin H. Oaks further clarifies this doctrine of stewardship in revelation.
He taught the following,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We should understand what can be called the principle of &#8216;stewardship in
revelation.&#8217;  Our Heavenly Father&#8217;s house is a house of order, where his servants
are commanded to act in the office in which [they are] appointed (Doctrine and
Covenants 107:99).  This principle applies to revelation.  Only the president of
the Church receives revelation to guide the entire Church.  Only the Stake
President receives revelation for the special guidance of the Stake.  The person
who receives revelation for the Ward is the Bishop.  For a family it is the
priesthood leadership of the family.  Leaders receive revelation for their own
stewardships.  Individuals can receive revelation to guide their own lives.  But
when one person purports to receive revelation for another person outside his or
her own stewardhship&#8211;such as a Church member who claims to have revelation
to guide the entire Church or a person who claims to have a revelation to guide
another person over whom he or she has no presiding authority according to the
order of the Church&#8211;you can be sure that such revelations are not from the Lord. 
If a revelation is outside the limits of stewardship, you know it is not from the
Lord, and you are not bound by it.  I have heard of cases where a young man told
a young woman she should marry him because he had received a revelation that
she was to be his eternal companion.  If this is a true revelation, it will be
confirmed directly to the woman if she seeks to know.  In the meantime, she is
under no obligation to heed it.  She should seek her own guidance and make up
her own mind.  The man can receive revelation to guide his own actions but he
cannot properly receive revelation to direct hers.  She is outside his stewardship.</i></p>
<p>I have heard that on occasion here at BYU-Idaho a return missionary will take a beautiful young
lady to the Idaho Falls temple and proceed to tell her about the dream he had the night before
where he was told that this beautiful young lady was to marry him.  I do not wish to make light of
this scenario as I know that we are treading on sacred ground where eternal marriage is
concerned.  I only mention it here to teach that this sacred revelation will come to both the young
man and the young woman.  We should not forget that revelation is stewardship bound.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Principle #7 The Spirit is not bizarre, weird or sensational.</span></p>
<p>&#160;The Church experienced the appearance of false spirits in Kirtland, Ohio shortly after the Gospel
was established there.  The Prophet Joseph Smith recorded the following,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Soon after the Gospel was established in Kirtland, and during the absence of the
authorities of the Church, many false spirits were introduced, many strange
visions were seen, and wild, enthusiastic notions were entertained; men ran out of
doors under the influence of this spirit, and some of them got upon the stumps of
trees and shouted, and all kinds of extravagances were entered into by them; one
man pursued a ball that he said he saw flying in the air, until he came to a
precipice, when he jumped into the top of a tree, which saved his life; and many
ridiculous things were entered into, calculated to bring disgrace upon the Church
of God, to cause the Spirit of God to be withdrawn, and to uproot and destroy
those glorious principles which had been developed for the salvation of the
human family.</i></p>
<p>False Spirits have manifested themselves from time to time throughout the history of the Church.
President Harold B. Lee taught the following,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>From the days of Hiram Page (Doctrine and Covenants 28), at different periods
there have been manifestations from delusive spirits to members of the Church.
Sometimes these have come to men and women who because of transgression
become easy prey to the Arch-Deceiver.  At other times people who pride
themselves on their strict observance of the rules and ordinances and ceremonies
of the Church are led astray by false spirits, who exercise an influence so
imitative of that which proceeds from a Divine source that even these persons,
who think they are &#8216;the very elect&#8217; find it difficult to discern the essential
difference.  Satan himself has transformed himself to be apparently &#8216;an angel of
light.&#8217;</i></p>
<p>Let us remember, Brothers and Sisters, that the Spirit is not weird.  It makes sense, it tastes good,
it just seems to be right.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Principle #8 The Spirit is quiet&#8211;it whispers.</span></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t shake us, but is a constant flow of communication.  It usually comes through our
thoughts and feelings.  Please turn with me to Doctrine and Covenants 8:2-3.  The Lord states, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost,
which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.  Now, behold,
this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by which Moses brought
the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground.</i></p>
<p>&#160;President Boyd K. Packer has taught</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand.
Rather, it whispers.  It caresses so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not
feel it at all...Occasionally it will press just firmly enough for us to pay heed.  But
most of the time, if we do not heed the gentle feeling, the Spirit will withdraw and
wait until we come seeking and listening.</i></p>
<p>&#160;President Ezra Taft Benson reminds us that dramatic experiences are the exception more than
the rule.  For most members of the Church, a testimony comes little by little, day by day, as they
keep the commandments of God.  He taught the following</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We must be careful, as we seek to become more and more godlike, that we do not
become discouraged and lose hope.  Becoming Christ-like is a lifetime pursuit
and very often involves growth and change that is slow, almost imperceptible. The
scriptures record remarkable accounts of men whose lives changed dramatically
in an instant, as it were: Alma the Younger, Paul on the road to Damascus, Enos
praying far into the night, King Lamoni.  Such astonishing examples of the power
to change even those steeped in sin give confidence that the Atonement can reach
even those deepest in despair.  But we must be cautious as we discuss these
remarkable examples.  Though they are real and powerful, they are the exception
more than the rule.  For every Paul, for every Enos, and for every King Lamoni,
there are hundreds and thousands of people who find the process of repentance
much more subtle, much more imperceptible.  Day by day they move closer to the
Lord, little realizing they are building a godlike life.  They live quiet lives of
goodness, service, and commitment.  They are like the Lamanites, who the Lord
said &#8216;were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.&#8217;</i></p>
<p>When I interview the youth of my Ward and I ask them to tell me if their testimony has grown,
sometimes they answer that they don&#8217;t know if they have a testimony or not.  These are some of
the best youth in the Church who are keeping the commandments, coming to Church every week,
paying their tithing, etc. etc.  I remind them that their testimony is growing every day, little by
little.  Then, I encourage them to bear their testimony.  President Packer teaches that it is in the
bearing of our testimonies that we find it.  He taught the following,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>The Holy Ghost communicates with the Spirit through the mind more than
through the physical senses.  This guidance comes as thoughts, as feelings,
through impressions and promptings.  It is not always easy to describe
inspiration.  The scriptures teach us that we may &#8216;feel&#8217; the words of spiritual
communication more than hear them, and see with spiritual rather than with
mortal eyes (see 1 Nephi 17:45).  The patterns of revelation are not dramatic. The
voice of inspiration is a still voice, a small voice.  There need be no trance no
sanctimonious declaration.  It is quieter and simpler than that.</i></p>
<p>We must remember that revelation is a process.  The change of the human soul takes time and
effort.  We must be patient and allow the Lord to mold us into what he wants us to become. Elder
Bruce R. McConkie taught the following,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in"><i>We are born again as we die as pertaining to unrighteousness and when we live
as pertaining to the things of the Spirit.  But that doesn&#8217;t happen in an instant,
suddenly.  That is a process.  Being born again is a gradual thing, except in a few
isolated instances that are so miraculous that they get written up in the scriptures.
As far as the generality of the members of the Church are concerned, we are born
again by degrees, and we are born again to added light and added knowledge and
added desires for righteousness as we keep the commandments.  As members of
the church, if we chart a course leading to eternal life; if we begin the processes
of spiritual rebirth, and are going in the right direction; if we chart a course of
sanctifying our souls, and degree by degree are going in that direction; and if we
chart a course of becoming perfect, and step by step and phase by phase, are
perfecting our souls by overcoming the world, then it is absolutely
guaranteed&#8211;there is no question whatever about it&#8211;we shall gain eternal life.
Even though we have spiritual rebirth ahead of us, perfection ahead of us, the full
degree of sanctification ahead of us, if we chart a course and follow it to the best
of our ability in this life, then when we go out of this life we&#8217;ll continue in exactly
that same course.</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was introduced to the profession of sculpture when I was a
very small child growing up on a farm in the delta of CaliforniaÂ’s San Joaquin and
Sacramento rivers.&nbsp; As a natural part of annual irrigations, large
quantities of clay would be deposited in the canals around my familyÂ’s
farm.&nbsp; I would spend countless summer days swimming in the canals and
sculpting everything imaginable from the rich abundance of clay.&nbsp; Today,
what I do for a living isnÂ’t all that different, except now I get paid to play
in the mud.&nbsp; As you students are choosing your future professions, I hope
you will be a lucky as I have been.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course there were lots of
years of formal schooling and preparations that came between those days on the
farm as a child and getting a job.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In art schools, a common term that is frequently used is the
word Aesthetics.&nbsp; There are even classes that are titled
Â“AestheticsÂ”.&nbsp; What does that word, aesthetic, mean?&nbsp; Often it is
defined as the study of or the philosophy of beauty.&nbsp; This definition is
not incorrect, but it is somewhat incomplete.&nbsp; It is not until we consider
the opposite of the word aesthetic that a better understanding becomes
apparent.&nbsp; And, by the way, its opposite is a word that most of us are
much more familiar with.&nbsp; The opposite of aesthetic is anesthetic.&nbsp;
Anyone who has ever been to the dentist understands what an anesthetic is, and
what it does.&nbsp; In the context of a dentistÂ’s office, an anesthetic is a
beneficial thing. But, most of us have also had the misfortune of leaving the
dentistÂ’s office before the effects of the anesthesia have worn off.&nbsp; In
that condition of being numb, if you are not very careful you can bite down and
damage the inside of your mouth without feeling it; at least not right
then.&nbsp; In that context, an anesthetic can be a frightful thing.&nbsp; It
can put us in a state wherein we can repeatedly damage ourselves without
feeling anything.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">LetÂ’s go back to our definition of aesthetics
then.&nbsp;&nbsp; If an anesthetic is something that numbs us and makes it
difficult or impossible to feel, than an aesthetic is something that does the
opposite: it enlivens us, and increases our capacity and sensitivity to feeling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to talk with you today about aesthetics and
anesthetics in a sense including, but also much broader than the arts.&nbsp;
LetÂ’s look at some scriptures that illustrate what I mean, starting with some
that refer to anesthetics.&nbsp; The first one is found in Ephesians chapter 4
verse19.&nbsp; Paul wrote to the saints in Ephesus, warning them to not become
like the gentiles who&nbsp; <i>Â“ being <u>past feeling</u> have given
themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greedinessÂ” </i>(emphasis
added).&nbsp; Notice the condition that Paul warns against.&nbsp; They were
Â“past feelingÂ”.&nbsp; They were anesthetized.&nbsp; And what were the
anesthetics used?&nbsp; Verses 17 and 18 tell us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These
included Â“vanityÂ” and Â“darkened understandingÂ” and Â“alienation from God through
ignoranceÂ”.&nbsp; Have you ever thought of vanity as being an anesthetic?&nbsp;
And in this state of being numbed and past feeling, what damages were they able
to inflict upon themselves without feeling it?&nbsp; Verse 19 already told
us.&nbsp; These were Â“lasciviousnessÂ” or in other words, lustfulness,
Â“uncleanessÂ” and Â“greedinessÂ”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another scripture that illustrates this same principle of a
people being anesthetized and unfeeling, and bringing upon themselves total
destruction can be found in MormonÂ’s 2<sup>nd</sup> epistle to his son Moroni.&nbsp;
This is found in Moroni Chapter 9, verse 20.&nbsp; Here it says: <i>Â“And now my
son, I dwell no longer upon this horrible scene.&nbsp; Behold, thou knowest the
wickedness of this people; thou knowest that they are without principle, and
past feeling.Â”</i>&nbsp; And if you want to know what anesthetics made this
possible, the first part of Chapter 9 lists them.&nbsp; They include <i>Â“angerÂ…hardnessÂ…and
a delight in everything except that which is good.Â”</i>&nbsp; There are a lot
of other anesthetics listed here as well.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A third example of this same principle is found in 1 Nephi
17: 45.&nbsp; Since this is early in the Book of Mormon, youÂ’ve no doubt read
it a number of times and remember</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">the incident that I am referring to.&nbsp; This is where
Laman and Lemuel are contending with their younger brother Nephi, this time
about the commandment from the Lord to build a ship.&nbsp; Listen to the words
that Nephi uses in this verse.&nbsp; Referring to the Lord, Nephi says,<i> Â“Â…he
hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye
could not <u>feel</u> his wordsÂ” </i>(emphasis added).&nbsp; You notice that
Nephi did not say that they were past hearing and could not hear His
words.&nbsp; Laman and Lemuel could and did hear, time and time again.&nbsp;
What they could not do was to Â“feelÂ”.&nbsp; They were anesthetized; and what
caused it?&nbsp; The first line of verse 45 describes it clearly.&nbsp; <i>Â“Ye
are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God.Â”&nbsp; </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My intent is not to focus on the anesthetics alone.&nbsp;
Today I would also like to address what some of the aesthetics are.&nbsp; These
we can take in as high of doses as we want.&nbsp; As far as I know, there is
not any way to do damage with an overdose.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">LetÂ’s contrast the scriptures we have already read with 2
Nephi 25:25.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this verse we read:&nbsp; <i>Â“We are made alive in
Christ because of our faith.Â”&nbsp; </i>FAITH:&nbsp; Can you imagine anything
more enlivening than is faith?&nbsp; My wife and I have had our lives blessed
time and time again through the life giving power of faith, and not just our
own, but also through the faith of others.&nbsp; In fact, one of the main
reasons that we ever got together in the first place was because of my mom, who
is a woman of great faith.&nbsp; She met Chris and started praying.&nbsp; The
poor girl didnÂ’t have a chance once that started.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another example of the blessings of faith:&nbsp; For the
first six years of our marriage, Chris and I were not blessed with
children.&nbsp; After numerous tests and visits to doctors, we were informed
that if we wanted children, it might be a good idea to look into
adoption.&nbsp; So we went to see our bishop to get more information about LDS
Social Services and the adoption process.&nbsp; Our bishop, Bishop Sione
Feinga, just looked as us with a somewhat puzzled look, and asked why we had
not first asked for a priesthood blessing.&nbsp;&nbsp; He just said Â“you come
back, IÂ’ll give you both a blessing. . . then youÂ’ll have babies.Â”&nbsp; He
didnÂ’t say Â“maybeÂ”, or Â“letÂ’s try this firstÂ”.&nbsp; He just said: Â“youÂ’ll have
babies.Â”&nbsp; A little under a year after that blessing, our first son was
born; Then two years later, our daughter; and then two more years another son;
and then another son.&nbsp; We started to think that we might have to go back
and see Bishop Feinga again and get another blessing!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another scripture that gives us many insights into what is
aesthetic and enlivening is one that we donÂ’t even have to look up.&nbsp; At
one time or another most of us have memorized this scripture.&nbsp; I refer to
the 13<sup>th</sup> Article of Faith.&nbsp; I would like to focus for a few
minutes on the four attributes listed at the end of this scripture where it
says<i>:&nbsp; Â“If there is anything [and note the inclusive word anything]
virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these
things.Â”</i>&nbsp; Pay careful attention to the attributes listed here, and
donÂ’t confuse them with their counterfeits.&nbsp; The ones listed are life
giving; they are aesthetics.&nbsp; The counterfeits do the opposite; they are
anesthetics.&nbsp; LetÂ’s look at them one at a time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first one is <b>VIRTUOUS</b>.&nbsp; What does virtue
include?&nbsp; Often represented in medieval and renaissance art are figures that
personify what were traditionally known as the seven virtues.&nbsp; These
include Faith, Hope, Charity, Temperance, Prudence, Fortitude, and
Justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; These can often be seen contrasted with seven traditional
vices that are opposites and sometime devious imitations.&nbsp; These include
pride, covetousness, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Virtue should never be confused with its counterfeit.&nbsp;
Virtue should never be confused with vogue.&nbsp; Vogue includes those things
that are merely socially acceptable, or politically correct.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a
recent study by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the following
was stated:&nbsp; <i>Â“Â…sex is most appropriate among people aged 18 and older
OR those who are married OR in committed relationships.Â”</i>&nbsp; Under that
standard who <u>doesnÂ’t</u> qualify?&nbsp; And that is to be in what they call
the Â“most appropriateÂ” level.&nbsp; How difficult would it be if you were
satisfied with being just plain Â“appropriateÂ” only?&nbsp; Another example of
the contrast between virtue and vogue can be seen with increasing and
frightening frequency in the definition and status of marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; On
forms requiring personal information under the heading of Marital Status, there
used to be just two boxes.&nbsp; Today you often see a variety of options to
this question, or this information along with the idea of marriage, is
considered irrelevant and left off the form completely.&nbsp; I know of nothing
more enlivening in this life or in the life to come than is eternal
marriage.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When making choices, especially about day to day routine
things like what to wear today, or what to watch on TV tonight (after homework,
of course), or what music to listen to, follow the counsel of the 13th Article
of Faith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or as DC 121:45 admonishes us:&nbsp; <i>Â“Let virtue garnish
thy thoughts unceasingly.Â”</i>&nbsp; You have no idea of the potential
deadening power and influence of the alternative. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The second aesthetic listed in the 13<sup>th</sup> Article
of Faith is that which is <b>LOVELY</b>.&nbsp; This is one that is often
confused with counterfeits, not only by society in general, but unfortunately
all too frequently by the youth of the church, even here at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp;
The attribute is LOVELY, or as the footnote to that verse further explains,
BEAUTY.&nbsp; It does not say glamorous, or even pretty, or any of the other
superficial and transient imitations that are often confused for and held up as
beauty.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now as I look out over this audience, I see a group of very
beautiful people. Coincidently, you happen to be rather good looking too, but
that is something that you donÂ’t get much of the credit for.&nbsp; Now if I
were to turn around and look at the faculty or administration behind me, I
could still honestly say that I was looking at beautiful people, couldnÂ’t
I?&nbsp; But you get my point.&nbsp; Some of those things that get represented
as beauty just donÂ’t last.&nbsp; If there is anything that I could convince you
of here today, it would be for you to not buy in to what our culture tries to
sell you as being beautiful!&nbsp; For one thing, it changes so quickly as fads
come and go.&nbsp; If you donÂ’t believe that, just look at your high school
yearbook.&nbsp; And that wasnÂ’t that long ago.&nbsp; IÂ’ve seen my high school
fashions come around a couple of times now.&nbsp; Secondly, the digitally and
surgically altered images shown to advertise beauty are usually extreme
distortions of reality, kind of like what is labeled Â“realityÂ” in TV
programs.&nbsp; And thirdly, different experiences and cultures give us
radically different and often contradictory messages about what is
beautiful.&nbsp; When my wife and I were not yet married students on
BYU-Hawaii, then Church College of Hawaii campus, Chris had a job working in
the snack bar at the Polynesian Cultural Center.&nbsp; Here was this absolutely
gorgeous, green-eyed beauty going to work every day.&nbsp; And do you know what
the number one thing was that the guys who worked there would say?&nbsp; Â“Hey
haole girl, how come you so skinny?Â”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your personal experiences will also greatly influence and
even completely change your perception of beauty.&nbsp; As a college student I
remember a time when I was introduced to a young lady that at first impression
I thought was rather funny looking.&nbsp; Her face was very round, and she had
white, not blond but white hair.&nbsp; Her eyebrows, and eyelashes were
white.&nbsp; Her complexion was very light also, and she really didnÂ’t wear
much makeup.&nbsp; In fact, the only features that really showed up much were
her dark eyes.&nbsp; My very first impression of her was that she looked like a
snowman!&nbsp; Now, this is kind of mean, but I tell you about it not because
of my first impression, but because of what happened over the next few
months.&nbsp; As I became more acquainted with this young lady, I began to see
her qualities of kindness, of gentleness, and graciousness.&nbsp; She was in
every sense a lovely person.&nbsp; But what was the most surprising to me was
that she became very beautiful to look at also.&nbsp; I could no longer see the
little snowman anymore, even when I looked for it.&nbsp; Something had
changed.&nbsp; And it wasnÂ’t her hair color, or her makeup, or the shape of her
face.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the arts, in literature, theatre, painting or poetry,
there are often examples of great beauty, but they are not always pretty.&nbsp;
I love the renaissance painter Dominico Ghirlandaio, who incidentally was the
young MichelangeloÂ’s painting teacher.&nbsp; His painting of Â“The Last SupperÂ”
is a masterpiece.&nbsp; This event was commonly represented in art, and often
portrays that moment wherein Christ announced to his disciples that one of them
would betray him.&nbsp; In representations of this event, the disciples are typically
shown in the attitude of humility and introspection, asking the question Â“Is it
I?Â”&nbsp; In GhirlandaioÂ’s painting, the disciples also share this attitude,
except for Peter.&nbsp; He clutches the knife that is before him on the table
and angrily glares at Judas as though to say: Â“IÂ’ll bet itÂ’s you!Â”&nbsp;
GhirlandaioÂ’s tense representation of anger bordering on violence gives
insights into the fiery and impulsive character of this soon to be humbled
disciple. And it is this anger and violence in contrast to the loving and forgiving
face of the Savior that makes the message of this paining even more beautiful. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another of GhirlandaioÂ’s paintings, which hangs in the
Louvre Museum, is often missed by those looking for more well know
pieces.&nbsp; This small painting depicts an old, grandfatherly gentleman who
is looking tenderly downward into the eyes of his grandson.&nbsp; The young
boyÂ’s gaze is likewise fixed upon the eyes of the old man.&nbsp; The shocking
thing that immediately confronts the viewer of this painting is that the old
man has a hideously deformed nose.&nbsp; Why would Ghirlandaio include
something so obviously grotesque in this painting?&nbsp; Not only is this
graphically ugly nose a dominant feature of the painting; it also happens to
fall directly in the line of sight between the old man and the young boy.&nbsp;
As you examine this masterpiece, you come to realize that the beauty of the
painting is because of, not in spite of that ugly nose.&nbsp; We the viewers
see it all to plainly. But the grandson, with his eyes fixed directly toward
that ugly nose, sees beyond.&nbsp; He alone is oblivious.&nbsp; I suppose this
painting is an example of what the Lord meant when he said we should become as
little children, who are so loving and forgiving.&nbsp; This is an example of
what is beautiful or lovely that goes much deeper than fleeting, superficial
characteristics.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The third quality listed in the 13<sup>th</sup> Article of
Faith is to seek after that which is of <b>GOOD REPORT</b>.&nbsp; What things
are commonly confused as being of good report?&nbsp; If we are not careful, we
can confuse Â“high achievementÂ” or Â“getting aheadÂ” as being of good
report.&nbsp; Those things are not mutually exclusive of course, but they can
become confused.&nbsp; Let me illustrate:&nbsp; When I was in High School, I
usually spent the last week or two of the semester madly seeking after that
which was of good report!&nbsp; What I was really most interested in was in the
report <u>card</u> that my parents would be receiving.&nbsp; As you know, at
the end of each year, the graduating senior who has compiled the highest
overall grades receives the honor of being named the Valedictorian.&nbsp; This
high honor is often accompanied by other external rewards such as scholarships
or offers from universities.&nbsp; In my High School graduating class, the sad
irony was that it was widely known, and even bragged about by the recipient,
that he had cheated time and time again.&nbsp; Now that fact did not contribute
to why I was not selected.&nbsp; But, it clearly illustrates the difference
between Â“high recognitionÂ” and Â“being of good reportÂ”.&nbsp; That which is of good
report frequently is not accompanied with public honors or recognition.&nbsp;
In fact, it sometimes brings just the opposite.&nbsp; Likewise, fame is not a
guarantee of actions that have been of good report.&nbsp; The evangelists
Matthew, Mark, and Luke all pose the same question when they ask:&nbsp; <i>Â“For
what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own
soul?Â”&nbsp; (Matthew 16:26)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Education is a great aesthetic, and it really doesnÂ’t matter
what area of study you are pursuing, or what the classes are that you may be
enrolled in.&nbsp; Brigham Young made this clear when he said <i>Â“Every
accomplishment, every polished grace, every useful attainment in mathematics,
music, and in all sciences and art belong to the SaintsÂ”</i>.&nbsp; This is a
pretty inclusive list.&nbsp; May I suggest to you that if you feel that a
particular class or subject is boring, the thing that is boring might just not
be the area of study, or the class, or might not even be the teacher!&nbsp;
Classes, like people, change as we increase our own understanding.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I remember when this change happened in my life, and when I
was Â“convertedÂ” to education.&nbsp; When I began my studies as an 18-year-old
university freshman, I, like many of you, didnÂ’t have any idea of what I wanted
to go into.&nbsp; So also like many of you, I started taking classes from the
dreaded list of General Education requirements.&nbsp; I have to admit that I
was anything but excited about beginning my 13<sup>th</sup> consecutive year of
going back to school in the fall.&nbsp; I was tired of it, and it had become
boring to me.&nbsp; And to make matters worse, college was a lot more work now
than it had been in high school.&nbsp; I was more interested in learning other
new things, like skiing.&nbsp; By the end of my freshman year, it was pretty
obvious from my performance and subsequent non-praiseworthy reports that if I
ever was to earn a university degree, and that was a pretty big if, it was
going to be Summa Cum Lousy! </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But with the passing of a little time, and with new
experiences, something strange happened:&nbsp; I started to like school!&nbsp;
It may have had something to do with having met Chris.&nbsp; The time frame
corresponds pretty closely. She was, and continues to be, a great example of
someone who loves studying and learning.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also have had
something to do with enrolling in one of those dreaded G.E. classes where I
started to find myself.&nbsp; A new pattern was being set, and that began to
change all the other courses as well.&nbsp; Once again, something had
changed.&nbsp; And once again, it wasnÂ’t the external things.&nbsp; They were
the same classes, the same teachers, and the same or even harder
workload.&nbsp; They just all looked different.&nbsp; What a shock it was to me
a little later in my education when I felt a sense of disappointment at the end
of a semester when I knew there were certain classes that I would not be able
to go to anymore.&nbsp; This is what education can do for you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In an art appreciation course I teach, I assign research and
writing assignments on specific artworks.&nbsp; I remember one semester a
student named Jennifer who did a research paper on Lorenzo GhibertiÂ’s sculpted
north doors of the Florence baptistery.&nbsp; These doors have 28 relief panels
that depict different events in the life of Christ.&nbsp; As it turned out, the
following summer I accompanied a group of BYU Idaho students on a study program
in Europe, and Jennifer was one of the students.&nbsp; For some reason, on the
morning that our group was in Florence and walking toward the cathedral, I
remembered that Jennifer had done that paper.&nbsp; As we neared the
baptistery, I located Jennifer in the group, and when we got close, I casually
pointed toward those doors and said Â“Jen, look over thereÂ”.&nbsp; Her reaction
was what every teacher hopes for.&nbsp; She first screamed, and then tears
filled her eyes as she simply muttered, Â“There it isÂ”.&nbsp; The others in the
group who were not as prepared for that experience did not have the same
aesthetic response, and in fact might have walked right past without even
noticing anything at all.&nbsp; The difference was education.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One thing then that we can and should be doing to enliven ourselves
is to become and then remain excited about learning; to keep stretching
ourselves in new areas and directions.&nbsp; And this is not just for you
students.&nbsp;&nbsp; On many occasions we have heard Pres. Bednar say that
every one on this campus is a teacher.&nbsp; The only way that this can truly
happen is if everyone on this campus, including staff, faculty, and
administration, is also a student.&nbsp; The completion of a degree or the
finding of a job should never be seen as something that happens when education
is finished.&nbsp; ThatÂ’s why we call the ceremony where degrees are awarded a
commencement and not a completion.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I told you at the beginning of my talk today that I feel
very fortunate to have found a job where I have so much fun playing in the
mud.&nbsp; Well, there is one thing that I can think of that I would trade my
current profession for; and that would be to do what you students are doing
now, homework and all.&nbsp; I just havenÂ’t been able to find a way to get
someone to pay me for doing it yet.&nbsp; Education is so enlivening. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The final quality that the 13<sup>th</sup> Article of Faith
counsels us to seek after is that which is <b>PRAISWORTHY</b>.&nbsp; Once
again, beware of the counterfeits.&nbsp; And again, these things are not
necessarily mutually exclusive, but all too frequently praiseworthy is
compromised by and confused with popularity.&nbsp; There is often no influence
stronger than the need of acceptance into a group of peers, and thatÂ’s not just
for you young people.&nbsp; ItÂ’s an interesting irony that we often feel the
need to be individual and unique . . . just like our friends!&nbsp; If they are
the right friends, then popularity and praiseworthiness go hand in hand and are
in harmony. But what do you do when the two are at odds?&nbsp; I can assure you
that you will inflict tremendous damage to yourself without feeling it right
away if your desire for popularity is not tempered by a high standard of
praiseworthiness.&nbsp; The parable of the prodigal son illustrates this
principle.&nbsp; Luke chapter15 verse 13 tells us <i>that Â“the younger son . .
. took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with
riotous living.Â”</i>&nbsp; As long as his money held out, so did his
popularity.&nbsp; And even though he did eventually come to his senses and
repent and return home, the damage was done and his birthright was squandered.&nbsp;
Not only that, but his popularity was gone with it.&nbsp; When principle is
compromised for popularity, it is inevitable that both will be lost.&nbsp; I
could give you additional example after example of this, but I really donÂ’t
have to.&nbsp; If you take a minute, you can remember an example of someone who
gave in to peer pressure, and did something that they knew was wrong.&nbsp; And
then afterwards, they were not more respected or more popular.&nbsp; In fact,
most of us can remember when we made that same mistake in one degree or
another.&nbsp; Let me repeat then.&nbsp; When principle is compromised for
popularity, it is inevitable that both will be lost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I donÂ’t think I could talk to you about this topic of being enlivened
without including one additional aesthetic that has been provided for us.&nbsp;
This one is mentioned time and time again in the scriptures.&nbsp; Do you know
what IÂ’m referring to?&nbsp; Let me give you a couple of scriptures that will
tell you.&nbsp; One is John 6: 63.&nbsp; A second one is 2 Corinthians
3:6.&nbsp; John tells us <i>Â“It is the spirit that quickeneth.Â”</i>&nbsp; And
Paul, writing to the Corinthians tells us that it is <i>Â“The spirit giveth
life.Â”</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Listen to what Elder Parley P. Pratt said to us as a promise
of the life-giving blessings of the Spirit.&nbsp; He said:&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left:0in"><i>[The Spirit] quickens all
the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands, and purifies all the
natural passions and affections, and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to
their lawful use.&nbsp; It inspires, develops, cultivates, and matures all the
fine-toned sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings, and affections of our
nature.&nbsp; It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness,
and charity.&nbsp; It develops beauty of person, form, and features.&nbsp; It
tends to health, vigor, animation, and social feeling.&nbsp; It invigorates all
the faculties of the physical and intellectual man.&nbsp; It strengthens and
gives tone to the nerves.&nbsp; In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the
bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the
whole being.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This promise from Elder Pratt sounds like the cure of every
ill.&nbsp; It sounds like the eternal fountain of youth, doesnÂ’t it?&nbsp;
Well, in a real sense, the Spirit is.&nbsp; Have you looked recently at the list
of life-giving principles found in the pamphlet entitled Â“For the Strength of
YouthÂ”?&nbsp; This list includes Agency and Accountability, Gratitude,
Education, Family, Friends, Dress and Appearance, Entertainment and the Media,
Music and Dancing, Language, Dating, Sexual Purity, Repentance, Honesty,
Sabbath Day Observance, Tithes and Offerings, Physical Health, Service to
Others, and Faith.&nbsp; Some of you here today who have recently graduated
from the Young MenÂ’s or Young WomenÂ’s program of the Church may be thinking
that this pamphlet is no longer for you.&nbsp; Look carefully at the
title.&nbsp; It says Â“For the Strength of YouthÂ”.&nbsp; It doesnÂ’t say Â“For
YouthÂ”. It says Â“For the Strength of YouthÂ”, and its principles are for all of
us, regardless of age.&nbsp; You can graduate from programs, but you never
graduate from principles. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Have you ever looked at the Prophet, or any of the general
authorities, and asked yourself Â“how can they accomplish all that they
do?Â”&nbsp;&nbsp; They are not young men, yet they run circles around most people.&nbsp;
How do they do it?&nbsp; Parley P. Pratt and this pamphlet just told you.&nbsp;
It is the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have been given so many things here in mortality to
choose from.&nbsp; Some bring the spirit of the Lord into our hearts, and
others drive that spirit away.&nbsp; And IÂ’m pretty sure that we all know the
difference most of the time.&nbsp; ItÂ’s only when we have anesthetized
ourselves to the Spirit that we cannot feel what we have heard or what we know
to be true.&nbsp; It is in that state of numbness that we can continue to
consciously inflict the spiritual damage of poor choices without feeing
anything.&nbsp; In Deuteronomy 30:19 the Lord says <i>Â“I have set before you
life and death, blessing and cursing:&nbsp; therefore choose lifeÂ….Â”</i> That
sounds like a no-brainer doesnÂ’t it. But how often do we make just the opposite
choice?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In closing, I would invite you to choose life.&nbsp;
Aestheticize yourself. You can do it by immersing yourself in the things that
are commonly thought of as the aesthetics, such as great art, music, literature,
theatre, or dance.&nbsp; But its not the subject matter that is the determining
factor.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is Â“anythingÂ” (as the 13<sup>th</sup> Article of Faith
says) that inspires, ennobles, and enlightens.&nbsp; It is Â“anythingÂ” that
invites the spirit of the Lord. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So choose life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose it with actions that are
virtuous and donÂ’t worry if they are in vogue or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose life
by surrounding yourself with those things that are lovely and beautiful whether
or not they are in fad or fashion.&nbsp; Choose life by working hard to <u>be
of</u> good report, not just to get a good report in the form of recognition or
external reward.&nbsp; And choose life by being praiseworthy regardless of how
it might affect your popularity.&nbsp; These things bring the Spirit, and as
John tells us, Â“The Spirit bringeth lifeÂ”, in the name of Jesus Christ,
amen.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">My brothers and sisters I am
honored to be here with you today.Â  I have a great love for this place.Â  I was
a student here shortly after the Fall of Adam.Â  Two of my children attended
here and they are quick to remind me that there is no evidence of my ever being
hereÂ—no professors that remembered me, no retired jersey, no pictures, no
plagues, no buildings named after me.Â  ItÂ’s hard to come back and see that I had
such little impact when I was a student here.Â  I hope today, however, that I
can make up for that a little and say something that will, at least in some
small way, allow me to claim some kinship to this great institution.Â Â Â Â Â Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">When I taught seminary many years
ago in Arizona, I showed a Church film to the students entitled <i>And Should
We Die</i>.Â  The movie is based on a true story about Latter-day Saints in Mexico
who were persecuted for their religious beliefs by Zapatista rebels during the
Mexican civil war shortly after the turn of the twentieth century.Â  The movie
focuses primarily on two LDS fathers, the branch president and his first
counselor, who were imprisoned and sentenced to death.Â  They were told they
would be spared the firing squad if they would denounce their Mormon beliefs.Â 
Because they refused to do so, the two men, President Rafael Monroy and Brother
Vicente Morales, were executed in front of their families and branch members on
 17 July 1915.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">My students were deeply affected
by the movie; many were even in tears.Â  In this setting I asked my sobered high
school studentsÂ—whose minds only minutes before had been on such things as
proms, football games, cool cars, hot guys, and what they were going to do for
fun on the weekendÂ—Â“Would you be willing to lay down your life rather than
denounce your faith and testimony of the restored gospel?Â”Â  The question was
designed to get the students to appreciate the sacrifices others had made for
the gospelÂ’s sake.Â  It was also meant to stimulate self-examination of their
convictions and commitments to the Lord.Â  I didnÂ’t expect anyone to answer.Â 
And, at first, only an outspoken macho young man on the back row said
anything.Â  He boldly declared, Â“Yeah, IÂ’d be willing to die for the Lord.Â”Â  I
wasnÂ’t sure that he was serious, because he was rarely serious about anything.Â 
However, this time he seemed very sincere.Â  After a moment or two of dead
silence, others began earnestly and in hushed tones (rare in a high school
seminary class) to declare their willingness to die for the cause of the
Master.Â  A young woman with tears streaming down her face sweetly stated that
she, too, would be willing to die for her beliefs, Â“because Jesus suffered and
died for me.Â”Â  It was one of the most remarkable occasions in my teaching
career.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The moment I shall never forget,
however, came after the bell rang to end our class.Â  As the students were
filing out of the classroom, one young man turned back to me and quietly asked,
Â“Brother Top, would you die for him?Â”Â  I hadnÂ’t been expecting that, so a
moment or two of silence passed that seemed like an eternity.Â  I was so
flustered I didnÂ’t really know quite how to answer.Â  Before I could answer, he
turned and left the building.Â  I have thought of that moment many times since.Â 
I have replayed it over and over in my mind, each time giving a response that I
thought would adequately and profoundly declare my devotion to the Lord and his
kingdom.Â  Yet the young man never got an answer from me.Â  I know what I should
have said and what I wanted to say.Â  But what would I really sayÂ—and more
important, what would I doÂ—when my life and soul depended on the answer?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I like to believe that I could
definitively and without hesitation declare that I would gladly lay down my
life for my faith.Â  Yet I am not sure giving that answer is as easy as it
sounds.Â  In fact, I am quite convinced that it isnÂ’t that easyÂ—nor was true
discipleship ever intended to be easy, comfortable, convenient, painless, or
free from sacrifice and sorrow.Â  Nevertheless, I hope that I could and would be
able to sacrifice my life for my testimony.Â  In the meantime, however, I can
say (as I should have said to my student who posed that penetrating question to
me), Â“I have made a covenant to do so if necessary.Â”Â  To follow Christ with
Â“full purpose of heartÂ” and to be a determined disciple in the truest sense of
the word requires a faith and commitment that comes only from a willingness to
lay oneÂ’s all on the altar of God.Â  To those who desired to be disciples of
Christ, Jesus repeatedly declared: <i>Â“If any man will come after me, let him
deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow meÂ”</i> (Luke 9:23;
emphasis added.Â  See also Matthew 10:38; 16:24; Mark 8:34; 10:21).Â  What does it meant to Â“take up the crossÂ”?Â  The scriptures seem to indicate that the
phrase has a double meaning, affecting both <i>life </i>and <i>death</i>.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">All Christians recognize the
cross as a graphic symbol of the CrucifixionÂ—the horrible agony and suffering
the Lord endured at the hands of his Roman executioners.Â  Crucifixion may have
been perfected by the Romans, but it certainly didnÂ’t begin with them.Â  For
many centuries and by many different nations and cultures, crucifixion in
various forms had been practiced as a means of torture and execution.Â  The
Greek word from which the word <i>crucifixion </i>is translated in our
scriptures is <i>stauros,</i> which literally refers to a stake or pole upon
which the victim was fastened in some cruel and torturous manner.Â  Crucifixion
was designed not only to bring about a slow and agonizing death but was also a
form of extreme humiliation.Â  Prior to the actual execution, the condemned man
would be stripped naked, scourged, mocked, and forced to carry the cross beam
to the place of execution through a midst of jeering spectators.Â  Death by crucifixion
was intended to send a signal to society that the Â“criminalÂ” condemned for
treason and sedition was beneath contemptÂ—the lowest of the low.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The phrase Â“to take up oneÂ’s
crossÂ” was a popular saying in JesusÂ’ day that may have originated with the zealots
and other nationalists who worked to overturn Roman occupation of their land.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[1]</span></span></a>Â 
Those who took up the cross were willing to give their lives for their
convictions and the cause of freedom.Â  The Savior taught his listeners that <i>his
</i>causeÂ—the liberation promised through his atonement and gospel
teachingsÂ—was an even greater cause than this and was one that believers should
be willing to die for to defend and uphold.Â  Taking up the cross came to mean
the sacrifice of everything, including oneÂ’s life if necessary, as well as
being willing to endure persecution, humiliation, and the mockery of the world
for oneÂ’s convictions.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Taking up the cross means the
same thing for us today as it did for the ancient disciples.Â  Discipleship
requires a devotion and allegiance to the Lord that allows nothingÂ—not property
or prestige, family or friendsÂ—to be more important to us than the Savior and
his cause.Â Â  Jesus taught in Matthew chapter 10 verses 37 and 38:Â  <i>Â“He that
loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth
son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me, And he that taketh not his
cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of meÂ” </i>(Matthew 10:37-38).Â  In my generation President Harold B. Lee testified: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>I bear
witness that until a person has been willing to sacrifice all he possesses in
the world, not even withholding his own life if it were necessary for the
upbuilding of the kingdom, then only can he claim kinship to Him who gave His
life that men might be.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[2]</span></b></span></a></i>Â 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">As I have pondered President
LeeÂ’s statement and the deep significance of the need to take up oneÂ’s cross, I
have wondered if I am truly willing to lay down my life and my all for the
Lord.Â  As I struggle with this issue, one thought seems to settle upon my mind
and in my heart.Â  It is as if I can hear the voice of the Savior saying, Â“I
donÂ’t need you to <i>die </i>for me.Â  I need you to <i>live </i>for me.Â”Â  It
seems simple; but it is deeply profound.Â  Living for the Lord is in many ways
far more demanding and a greater test of faith than dying for the Lord.Â  It is
this sentiment that is reflected in the Apostle PaulÂ’s admonition to the Roman
Saints found in chapter 12 verse 1: <i>Â“Present your bodies a </i>living
sacrifice<i>Â”</i> (Romans 12:1; emphasis added).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Clearly, the cross is a symbol of
death, but so is it the ultimate symbol of life.Â  Taking up the cross requires
not only a willingness to sacrifice and even die for the Lord, but also to live
and love as the Lord did.Â  Taking up the cross is also a symbol of sacrifice.Â 
Rather than a sacrifice of life and limb, however, it is often symbolic of
self-sacrificeÂ—a sacrifice of sinfulness and selfishnessÂ—a sacrifice of the
natural man and all ways and things of the world that prevent consecrated
discipleship.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Various accounts of JesusÂ’
teachings to take up the cross denote a double meaning of <i>death </i>and <i>life.</i>Â 
Luke, for example, adds an important word in his account that clearly bespeaks <i>living
for the Lord. </i>In Luke chapter 9 verse 23 we read:<i> Â“If any man will come
after me, let him deny himself, </i>and take up his cross daily<i>, and follow
meÂ”</i> (Luke 9:23; emphasis added).Â  The word <i>daily </i>makes all the
difference.Â  Laying down your lifeÂ—<i>dying for the Lord</i>Â—can be done only
once.Â  Taking up the cross, however, is to be done daily.Â  <i>Living for the
Lord </i>is an act of daily discipleship and devotion.Â  How do we take up the
cross every day?Â  The answer is found in the same scriptural accounts.Â  In
addition to the word <i>daily, </i>Luke (and the other Gospel writers)
highlights the SaviorÂ’s use of the phrases Â“deny himselfÂ” and Â“follow me.Â”Â 
What do we deny ourselves and how do we follow the Lord?Â  The Joseph Smith
Translation of Matthew 16 verse 26 provides the answer, <i>Â“And now for a man
to take up his cross, is to </i>deny himself all ungodliness, and every worldly
lust, and keep my commandment<i>sÂ”</i> (JST Matthew 16:26; emphasis added).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">What we sacrifice, or deny
ourselves, in taking up the cross is the ungodliness of the world.Â  As Elder
Neal A. Maxwell insightfully observed, Â“So it is that real, personal sacrifice
never was placing an animal on the altar.Â  Instead, it is a willingness to put
the animal in us upon the altar and letting it be consumed!Â”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[3]</span></span></a>Â 
It is this kind of sacrifice, this kind of self-denial, that constitutes <i>living
for the Lord.Â  </i>This kind of Â“taking up the crossÂ” must be continual, not
episodic.Â  It means, as Jesus declared, that we must <i>Â“forsake the world, and
save your soulsÂ”</i> (JST Matthew 16:29).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The phrase Â“taking up the cross,Â”
as it describes the need for continual faith and devotion, may be linked to
something else Jesus taught.Â  In Matthew 11 verse 29, he declared: <i>Â“Take my
yoke upon you.Â”</i>Â  It is interesting to note that the Greek word for yoke is <i>zugos</i>,
which implies a beam or pole that attaches or connects two things together.Â  A
crossbeam, to which a condemned man was attached and required to carry to his
crucifixion, could also be referred to as a yoke.Â  Some Bible scholars have
suggested that the phrases Â“take up the crossÂ” and Â“take my yokeÂ” are
conceptually related to each other.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[4]</span></span></a>Â 
Did Jesus use the phrases interchangeably?Â  We do not know, but it is
interesting to ponder the wordplay and the images created by the metaphors.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Jews of JesusÂ’ day often used
the term <i>yoke </i>to refer to the Â“burden of the lawÂ”Â—their connection to
and responsibility to live the Law of Moses.Â  They were under Â“the yoke of the
law.Â”Â  It was, as it were, the <i>cross </i>they had to bear.Â  Many viewed that
yoke as harsh or burdensome.Â  Those who felt that way did not realize that it
was the yoke that connected or attached them to their God.Â  Jesus was offering
to exchange yokes with themÂ—inviting them to give up the old yoke of the Mosaic
Law and take up the new yokeÂ—his way or Â“burden.Â”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[5]</span></span></a>Â 
The law of ChristÂ—the higher law, the everlasting gospel of Jesus
ChristÂ—fulfilled and superseded the Law of Moses.Â  It is this yoke that Jesus
described as easy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>Â“Come unto
me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>Â“Take my yoke

rest unto your souls.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>Â“For my yoke
is easy, and my burden is lightÂ” </i>(Matthew 11:28-30).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The word <i>yoke</i>, or the
Â“burden of the law,Â” reminded the ancient Jews of their covenantal
obligations.Â  In this sense, taking up the cross or taking ChristÂ’s yoke upon
us is the sameÂ—a reminder that discipleship requires responsibilities as well
as sacrificesÂ—living as well as dying for the faith.Â  Taking the SaviorÂ’s yoke
upon us causes us to become connected, fastened, or attached to him.Â  This is
no passive endeavor.Â  It requires all of our beingÂ—heart, might, mind, and
soul.Â  Certainly that is what Jesus meant when he taught us that taking up the
cross requires following himÂ—not just following him in death, but following his
example, becoming connected to his gospel and securely fastened to his atoning
sacrifice.Â  Taking up the cross in that sense requires continual effort and
obedience, daily devotion and diligence, and recurring repentance and
recommitment when we fall short.Â  Dying as a martyr for our faith in Christ may
be an event, but taking up the cross of Christ as a true disciple is a
process.Â  The process of discipleship begins with our <i>choosing </i>to follow
the Master and taking his yoke or cross upon us.Â  It ends (in reality it never
ends, but you know what I mean) with total <i>consecration </i>of ourselves to
him and his kingdom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">These two wordsÂ—<i>choice </i>and
<i>consecration</i>Â—are like bookends in the process of discipleship with two
more words describing discipleship located between themÂ—<i>conviction</i> and <i>conversion</i>.Â 
Taking the cross of Christ upon us and remaining yoked with him provides
passage through each phase.Â  Only at the end of the process, however, does the
yoke become truly easy and the burden really light.Â  At the end of the
Â“discipleship tunnelÂ” is found genuine light and life, peace and joy
inexpressible.Â  To attain those we must take up the cross, not lay it down or
abandon itÂ—remaining in the yoke, fastened securely to the Savior.Â  True
discipleship requires nothing less.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Many people <i>chose </i>to
listen to JesusÂ—some out of sincere faith, others out of sheer curiosity.Â  Many
followed the Master from place to place.Â  Yet that didnÂ’t make them followers
of the Lord, in the truest sense of the word.Â  Many witnessed his miracles and
were amazed.Â  Yet that didnÂ’t make them disciples.Â  Perhaps many even felt
spiritual awakening within their souls when they heard Jesus speak Â“as one
having authority from GodÂ” (JST Matthew 7:37).Â  Nonetheless, more was required
of those who became devoted disciples and true believers.Â  It is the same for
us today.Â  After choosing to listen, observe, and feel what Jesus has to offer,
true disciples must become <i>convinced</i> of his divinity as the literal Son
of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world, as well as the truthfulness of
his gospel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i>Â“Whom say ye that I am?Â”</i>Â 
Jesus asked the Twelve (Matthew 16:15).Â  His question remains relevant to any
and all who desire to become a disciple.Â  Answers such as the following, though
each is true, are inadequate and miss the essence of what it means to be his
disciple.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">Â“You are a great

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In response to the MasterÂ’s
probing question, Peter declared: <i>Â“Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
living GodÂ”</i> (Matthew 16:16).Â  Peter had <i>chosen </i>to leave his fishing
boat when Jesus said, Â“Come, follow me.Â”Â  No doubt he had been impressed with
the SaviorÂ’s miracles and had been inspired and instructed by his teaching.Â 
However, the real staying power of PeterÂ’s discipleship did not begin with
those moments, but rather when he became <i>convinced</i>, when he had a
testimony that burned within his soul.Â  As Jesus declared: <i>Â“Flesh and blood
hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heavenÂ”</i> (Matthew
16:17).Â  This <i>conviction</i>Â—this witness that comes by the power of the
Holy GhostÂ—is available to all.Â  It is a requisite first step in taking up the
cross of Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It requires considerable
diligence, intellectually and spiritually, to obtain a personal <i>conviction</i>
of the truth.Â  That is one reason why there were many, many more people who
Â“followedÂ” Jesus, listened to his sermons, witnessed his miracles, and felt of
his love, than those who <i>truly </i>followed him, valiantly remaining with
him until the endÂ—and beyond.Â  Disciples that have come to know with certainty
who he really is are those who have continuously and seriously studied his
words (and those of his servants), have pondered them, and have prayed for a
witness of the truth through the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is interesting to me to note
that the pattern of discipleshipÂ—of taking up the crossÂ—is evidenced by the
progression of questions in the temple recommend interview.Â  The first few all
deal with this step in the process we call <i>conviction</i>Â—what we <i>know</i>.Â 
Â“Do you have a testimony of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, and the
Holy Ghost?Â” Â“Do you have a testimony of the Atonement and of JesusÂ’ role as
Savior and Redeemer of the world?Â”Â  Before any question is asked about behavior
and worthiness, we report on our level of <i>conviction</i>Â—our personal
testimony and spiritual knowledge of truth.Â  Before we are asked concerning
what we are <i>doing </i>(or not doing) in our lives, we are asked about what
we <i>know</i>.Â  Yet, <i>knowing</i> and <i>doing</i> are interrelated.Â  They
are not, nor can they be, independent and separable in the lives of true
disciples.Â  Jesus taught in John chapter 7 verses 16 and 17, <i>Â“My doctrine is
not mine, but his that sent me.Â  If any man will</i> do<i> his will, he shall
know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myselfÂ” </i>(John
7:16-17; emphasis added).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Keeping the commandments and
doing oneÂ’s duty in the Church are essential elements for gaining a personal
testimony.Â  President David O. McKay taught </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>I know, too,
that a knowledge of the truth of the gospel may be obtained only through
obedience to the principles thereof.Â  In other words, the best way to know the
truth of any principle is to live it.</i><a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[6]</span></span></a>Â 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">President McKay often recounted
that his own personal testimony came, not in some dramatic or mystical manner,
but <i>Â“as a natural sequence to the performance of duty.Â”</i><a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[7]</span></span></a>Â 
In this manner, <i>doing </i>can lead to <i>knowing</i>.Â  In turn, <i>conviction</i>
can lead to <i>conversion</i>.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i>Â“If ye </i>know <i>these
things,Â”</i> Jesus declared, <i>Â“happy are ye if ye</i> do <i>themÂ”</i> (John
13:17; emphasis added).Â  Taking up the cross of ChristÂ—becoming and remaining a
true disciple of the MasterÂ—requires both spiritual knowledge of his divinity <i>and
</i>obedience to his gospel.Â  Testimony has no saving power if it doesnÂ’t lead
to greater righteousness, deeper devotion to God, and increased service to our
fellowmen.Â  The spiritual witness of truth is important, but it is only a
beginning point.Â  <i>Conviction</i> must lead to <i>conversion</i>Â—the willing
submission to the principles and ordinances of the gospel and faithful, not
blind, obedience to the teachings of the Lord and his servants.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus
taught: <i>Â“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven, </i>but he that doeth the will of my Father<i>Â”</i> (Matthew
7:21; emphasis added).Â  Perhaps we can paraphrase this verse to illustrate the
progression from knowledge to actionÂ—<i>conviction </i>to <i>conversion</i>Â—that
is required of true disciples.Â  Not everyone that has a testimony and says, Â“I
know that Jesus is the ChristÂ” or Â“I know that the gospel is trueÂ” will inherit
the celestial kingdom.Â  Those who gain a spiritual witness of truth and <u>then</u>
faithfully seek to live in accordance with that spiritual knowledgeÂ—those who <i>know
and do</i> what the Lord saysÂ—will be exalted.Â  A convert is not just a person
who gains a knowledge of truth, but one who then fully embraces that truth and
seeks to live it.Â  One cannot really take up the cross with intellectual effort
alone, no matter how strong the conviction.Â  Conversion must follow, or the
disciple will eventually stumble under the weight of the cross and detach
himself from the yoke of the gospel.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Many years ago, Sister Naomi
Randall wrote the familiar Primary song, Â“I am a Child of God.Â”Â  In her
original version (which I remember from my own days of attending Primary in
Idaho Falls), the words of the chorus were:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">President Spencer W. Kimball
suggested that the word <i>know</i> should be changed to <i>do</i>Â—and that is
how we sing the song today.Â  He wanted children of God of all ages to
understand that knowing is important, but only as it leads us to doing what we
must do to someday dwell with our Father in Heaven. Each time I sing this
familiar hymn I am reminded of the dual demands of discipleshipÂ—knowing and
doing, conviction and conversion.Â  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">This connection between knowing
and doing is clearly illustrated in the temple recommend interview.Â  After the
first questions regarding testimony and <i>conviction</i> are addressed, then
we are evaluated in our manner of behavior and obedience.Â  What we <i>do</i>
speaks somewhat of the degree of our discipleship and our conversion.Â  Â“<i>Do </i>you
keep the Word of Wisdom?Â” Â“<i>Do </i>you live the law of chastity?Â” Â“<i>Do </i>you
pay a full tithing?Â” and so on.Â  These actions are important indicators of our
commitment and conversion.Â  They are like mile markers along the pathway of
discipleship, but they do not, nor can they by themselves, tell the whole
story.Â  Outward actionsÂ—<i>what we do</i>Â—may tell much about the direction we
are heading.Â  In reality, however, it is our heart and inner spirituality and
commitmentÂ—<i>what we are</i>Â—that ultimately guides us to the desired
destination.Â  Taking up the cross requires <i>knowing</i> and <i>doing</i>, but
most of all, it requires <i>being</i>.Â  In fact, we are not completely
converted until our whole being is positively changed and we become, as Paul
taught, Â“new creatures in Christ.Â”</p>

taking his yoke upon us is <u>becoming</u> <i>consecrated</i>Â—giving ourselves
and our heart (not just our minds and our actions) wholly to his causeÂ—striving
to <i>become </i>more like the Savior in all aspects of our lives, both
inwardly and outwardly.Â  In this manner, taking up the cross is not just what
we <i>know</i> and how we <i>behave</i>, but what we have <i>become</i>Â—what we
really <i>are</i> through and through.Â  Elder Neal A. Maxwell eloquently
stated, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>Some give of
their time yet withhold themselves, being present without giving of their
presence, going through the superficial motions of membership instead of the
deep emotions of consecrated discipleship. . . . Real disciples are . . .
precept by precept and experience by experience, becoming ever more like the
Master they serve.</i><a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[9]</span></span></a>Â 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Elder Dallin H. Oaks explained
the process in this manner.Â  He stated:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>The Apostle
Paul taught that the LordÂ’s teachings and teachers were given that we may all
attain Â‘the measure of the stature of the fulness of ChristÂ’ (Ephesians 4:13).Â 
This process requires far more than acquiring knowledge.Â  It is not even enough
for us to be convinced of the gospel; we must act and think so that we are
converted by it.Â  In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us
to know something, the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to become
something.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>. . . The
Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil
actsÂ—what we have done.Â  It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our
acts and thoughtsÂ—what we have become.Â  It is not enough for anyone just to go
through the motions.Â  The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel
are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account.Â  The
gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly
Father desires us to become.Â”<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[10]</span></b></span></a></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Building upon the analogy IÂ’ve
used before, we see the culmination of this process in the final question of
the temple interview.Â  Â“<i>Are you worthy</i> to enter the temple and
participate in temple ordinances?Â”Â  I find a striking parallel between these
questions and the process by which we take up the cross.Â  What do we <i>know</i>?Â 
What do we <i>do </i>(or how do we <i>behave</i>)?Â  What <i>are </i>we?Â  Each
phaseÂ—knowing, doing, and becomingÂ—shapes the man and woman of Christ.Â  Being,
however, is the ultimate indicator of our devotion as disciples.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Lord doesnÂ’t just want us to
know where the meetinghouse is; he wants us to attend services there.Â 
Attending, however, must be more than just staying awake or even answering a
few questions in quorums or classes.Â  It is not enough to just go through the
Church, we must have the ChurchÂ—its ordinances, practices, teachingsÂ—go through
us and become a very real part of us.Â  We must live the gospel, but also make
it our life.Â  Being a consecrated discipleÂ—taking up his crossÂ—will cause me to
not only avoid evil influences and immoral thoughts and behaviors, but to
become a man of virtue.Â  Virtue is not just a matter of what we do or donÂ’t do;
what we look at or donÂ’t look at; itÂ’s a matter of what we <u>are</u>.Â  The
Lord doesnÂ’t want us simply to be quiet in church and act in a reverent manner;
he wants us to be reverent.Â  Reverence is not only what we do or how we act,
but it is also what we areÂ—people whose hearts are filled with love, adoration,
and awe for the things of God.Â  The Lord doesnÂ’t want me to merely <i>go </i>to
the temple; he wants me to <i>be </i>a templeÂ—to <i>become </i>the kind of
person where the Spirit of the Lord can dwell in abundance.Â  Conviction
requires my mind and spirit.Â  Conversion requires my best behavior, strict
obedience, and devotion to duty.Â  Consecration, however, requires all of this
and so much more.Â  It requires <u>all of me</u>Â—my whole soul.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Perhaps you are asking, as I have
asked myself many times throughout the years, Â“How do I become that kind of
consecrated disciple?Â  How can I get from knowing and doing to being?Â”Â 
Unfortunately (or fortunately, for our sakes), there is no checklist of things
to be done and crossed off, no detailed, sequential flowchart to guide us, no
recipe card of ingredients and directions to be meticulously followed.Â  There
are some things, however, that I do know we need to do.Â  Yet, there are some
steps, if you will, that can be followed.Â  I know what needs to be done to
obtain and retain a testimonyÂ—becoming <i>convinced</i>.Â  I know what I must <i>do
</i>to keep the commandments and fulfill my covenantal
responsibilitiesÂ—becoming <i>converted.Â  </i>This much of taking up the cross I
can do by myself.Â  The becoming totally <i>consecrated</i>Â—becoming like the
SaviorÂ—requires <u>something</u> and <u>someone</u> else. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In John chapter 13 verses 34 and
35 we read what Jesus taught the Twelve at the Last Supper: <i>Â“A new
commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you,
that ye also love one another.Â”</i>Â  Then comes this familiar, yet profound
declaration: <i>Â“By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye
have love one to anotherÂ”</i> (John 13:34-35).Â  I think the answer to our
question, Â“How do we <i>become</i> consecrated disciples of Christ?Â” is found
in that statement.Â  The <i>something </i>that allows us to <i>become </i>his
disciples is love.Â  The <i>someone </i>who enables us to carry the cross with
complete consecration is Christ himself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I donÂ’t think Jesus was saying
that the hallmark of true discipleship is based only on how we treat each other
or serve our fellowmen.Â  The key phrase seems to be Â“as I have loved you.Â”Â  His
loveÂ—<i>charity</i>, or <i>the pure love of </i>ChristÂ—is that which makes all
the difference.Â  His atoning sacrificeÂ—the ultimate act of charityÂ—is that
which transforms us.Â  We <i>choose </i>him, but he <i>changes us</i>.Â 
Partaking of his atonement is like yeast in the bread-making process.Â  We can
provide the ingredientsÂ—the efforts and diligence to come to <i>know</i>, the
obedience and keeping the commandments that helps us become <i>converted</i>Â—but
he, like the yeast, raises us into consecrated disciples.Â  In this manner, the
hallmark of discipleship is loveÂ—his love.Â  When we have come to taste of that
love through faith, repentance, and obedient endurance, which is, as Lehi and
Nephi taught, <i>Â“most desirable above all thingsÂ”</i> (see 1 Nephi 8:10-12;
11:16-22), bearing the yoke of Christ truly becomes easy and burdens become
light. The SaviorÂ’s perfect love for us affects everything we think, everything
we know, everything we do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">When we are transformed by his
love, it becomes easy to live his commandments.Â  It becomes easy to love and
serve one anotherÂ—not because of what we do, but because of what he has made of
us.Â  The phrase Â“as I have loved youÂ” has come to mean to me Â“because I have
loved you.Â”Â  Because he has loved me, I am filled with his love.Â  Because of
this pure love, taking up his cross daily is not a chore, it is a privilege.Â 
His yoke is not a burden, it is a blessing.Â  Daily partaking of his love
through faith, repentance, and obedience to the principles and ordinances of
his gospel will inevitably transform us from merely <i>knowing</i> and <i>doing
</i>to <i>being </i>consecrated disciples.Â  In this manner, carrying the cross
of Christ will not weigh us down but lift us up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Now, more than two decades since
my seminary teaching days in Arizona, I still think of that lone student asking
me as he was exiting my seminary class, Â“Brother Top, would you die for
Christ?Â”Â  I believe I now know the answer: Â“Only if I am daily <u>living</u>
for him.Â”Â  It is those daily acts of <i>conviction, conversion, and
consecration</i>Â—the degree to which I am living for himÂ—that will determine
whether or not I could really die for him.Â  There is one thing I know for sure:
The more I come to know, feel, and experience the transforming power of the
Atonement, the more I desire to love him, the more I desire to serve him, and
the more I feel to give to him.Â  Even dying for him seems too small a
sacrifice.Â  As the noted hymn writer, Isaac Watts, penned:</p>
